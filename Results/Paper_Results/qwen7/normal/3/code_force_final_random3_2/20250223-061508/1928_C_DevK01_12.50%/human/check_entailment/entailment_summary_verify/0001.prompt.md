You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where `q` is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. Both `q` and `x` satisfy 1 <= x < q <= 10^9. The function calculates and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients when divided into `q`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `y = n + x` is even. If it is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the settling pattern requires an even number of positions to complete one full cycle.

3. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` which calculates possible values of `k` for the first part of the settling pattern.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it also calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` for the second part of the settling pattern.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates possible values of `k` using a mathematical approach.
   - It first checks if `q` (which is `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`) is a perfect square.
   - Then it iterates through all divisors of `q` and adds those divisors to the list `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the unique values in `L1` after processing both parts of the settling pattern.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - When `y` is odd, the program correctly prints `0` because no valid `k` exists.
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies potential `k` values by checking divisors and perfect squares.
  - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` ensures that the second part of the settling pattern is considered only when necessary.

- **Mathematical Correctness:**
  - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly identifies divisors and perfect squares that could represent valid `k` values.
  - The use of set to remove duplicates before calculating the length ensures the output is unique.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
