Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `int(w // 1)`. Since `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w >= x - 1`, the loop will iterate over all integers from `1` up to `w`.

3. **Understand the Postcondition After Previous Iteration**:
   - `q` is an integer.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`.
   - `M` is a list containing `[w, i, q // i]` where `i` is a divisor of `q` and `i >= x - 1`. If `q // i >= x - 1`, then `M` includes `q // i`; otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `1 <= k < w`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `k + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `k + 1` is still within the range of `1` to `w`.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < w`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `w - 1` if it was `w - 2` in the previous iteration.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `w - 2` before, it will now be `w - 1`.
   - `w` and `q` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`q` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[w, i, q // i]` where `i` is a divisor of `q` and `i >= x - 1`. If `q // i >= x - 1`, then `M` includes `q // i`; otherwise, `M` remains unchanged, and `i` is `w - 1`**.
