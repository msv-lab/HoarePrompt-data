Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(w // 1)`. 

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(w // 1)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `q` is an integer.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`.
   - `M` is a list containing `[w, i, q // i]` where `i` is a divisor of `q` and `i >= x - 1`.
   - After the if-else block executes, `i` is added to itself in the list `M`. If `q // i >= x - 1`, then `q // i` is also added to the list `M`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was a divisor of `q` and `i >= x - 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < int(w // 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body increments `i`).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `w` remains the same since it is derived from `q` and does not change within the loop.
   - `M` will be updated according to the if-else block, but we only need to consider the condition for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `w` remains the same.
- `M` will be updated based on the if-else block, but we only need to ensure the loop condition is met.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`q` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[w, i+1, q // (i+1)]` where `i+1` is a divisor of `q` and `i+1 >= x - 1`.**
