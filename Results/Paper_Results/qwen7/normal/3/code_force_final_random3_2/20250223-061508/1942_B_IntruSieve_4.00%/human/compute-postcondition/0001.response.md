Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking input as a string, splitting it by spaces, and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
