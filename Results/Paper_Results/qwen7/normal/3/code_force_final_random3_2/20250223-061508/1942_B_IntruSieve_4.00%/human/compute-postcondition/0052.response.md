Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for itm in mex:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `itm` and `mex`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `mex` is a non-empty list. This means that at the start of each iteration, `mex` must still be a non-empty list.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mex` must be a non-empty list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `mex` is non-empty, for the loop to execute one more time, `mex` must still be a non-empty list.
   - The variable `itm` is used within the loop body but its value does not affect the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `mex` must remain a non-empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mex` must be a non-empty list**
