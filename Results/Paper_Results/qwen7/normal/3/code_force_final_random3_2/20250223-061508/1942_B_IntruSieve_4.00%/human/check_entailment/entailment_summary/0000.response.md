Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The provided code attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array \( a \) and calculating the MEX value for each position.
3. However, the logic used in the code to calculate the MEX values and construct the permutation \( p \) is flawed. Specifically:
   - The code initializes `minn` to 0 and increments it when `arr[i]` is positive, but this does not correctly compute the MEX.
   - The code appends `minn` to the `mex` list when `arr[i]` is positive, which does not align with the definition of MEX.
   - The code does not handle negative values of `arr[i]` correctly, as it subtracts `minn` from the absolute value of `arr[i]`, which is not equivalent to finding the MEX.
4. The code does not actually construct the permutation \( p \) based on the MEX values; instead, it prints a sequence of integers stored in `mex`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
