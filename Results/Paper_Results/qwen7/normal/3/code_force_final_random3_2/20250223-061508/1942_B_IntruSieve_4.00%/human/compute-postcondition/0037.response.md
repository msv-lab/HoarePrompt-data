Output State: **`minn` is `maxx` + 1; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `mex` has an additional element which is `minn`; `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` if `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `minn = maxx + 1` updates the value of `minn` to be exactly `maxx + 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
