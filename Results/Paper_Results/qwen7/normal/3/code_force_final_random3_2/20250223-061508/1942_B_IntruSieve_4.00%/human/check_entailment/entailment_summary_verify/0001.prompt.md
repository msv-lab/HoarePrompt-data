You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it calculates a sequence of integers stored in `mex` based on the input array and a variable `minn`. After processing all test cases, it prints the elements of `mex` for each test case. The final state of the program includes the printed sequence of integers for each test case, while the input variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the MEX values.
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered.

3. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, the program checks if the value is positive.
     - If positive, it appends the current `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it resets `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
   - If the value is negative, it calculates the MEX value as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if necessary.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex`.

### Problem-Specific Analysis

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of an array is defined as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
  - The program attempts to construct the permutation `p` such that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.

- **Handling Positive Values**:
  - When `arr[i]` is positive, the program correctly sets `mex[i]` to `minn` and increments `minn`.
  - This ensures that the smallest missing integer is added to the permutation, which is consistent with the definition of MEX.

- **Handling Negative Values**:
  - When `arr[i]` is negative, the program calculates the MEX as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends it to `mex`.
  - This step ensures that the permutation is constructed correctly to match the given `a` array.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `minn` equals `maxx` by resetting `minn` to `maxx + 1`, ensuring that the next MEX value is correctly calculated.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and follows the logic of the MEX function. Therefore, the program is correct.
