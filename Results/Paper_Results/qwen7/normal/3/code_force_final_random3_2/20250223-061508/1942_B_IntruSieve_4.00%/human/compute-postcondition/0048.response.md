Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State Analysis
- `minn` is either `maxx + 1`, `maxx + 2`, ..., up to `maxx + n`.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or an additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` for each iteration.
- `maxx` is the maximum value between `maxx` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each iteration where `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`.

### Loop Head Objects
The loop head contains the following objects:
- `itm` (which iterates over elements in `mex`)

### Loop Execution Conditions
The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `mex` to iterate over. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `mex`.

### Adjusted State
Since the loop will continue to execute as long as `mex` contains elements, we need to ensure that `mex` is non-empty. Given the initial conditions, `mex` will always contain elements because it is defined to include the absolute differences and the value of `minn`.

### Final State
The final state should reflect that the loop will execute as long as `mex` is non-empty. Since `mex` is guaranteed to be non-empty based on its definition, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

### State Adjustment
State: **`mex` must be a non-empty list**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected.
