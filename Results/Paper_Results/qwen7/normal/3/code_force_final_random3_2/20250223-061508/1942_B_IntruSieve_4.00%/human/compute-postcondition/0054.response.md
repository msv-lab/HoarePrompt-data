Output State: **`mex` will contain all the absolute differences between each element in `arr` and `minn`, starting from `minn` being `maxx + 1` up to `maxx + n`. Additionally, `minn` will be appended to `mex` for each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and `maxx` will be the maximum value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop.**

To break this down in simpler terms:
- The list `mex` will include the absolute differences between each element in the array `arr` and the minimum number `minn`, starting from `minn = maxx + 1` and going up to `minn = maxx + n`.
- For each iteration where the element in `arr` is greater than 0, `minn` itself will be appended to `mex`.
- The variable `maxx` will hold the highest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, where the update condition is `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`.
