Based on the initial state provided, `mex` is described as a non-empty list. However, no specific values or elements of the list are mentioned. Since the list is non-empty, it contains at least one item, but we do not know what that item is.

The `print` statement simply prints the first element of the list `mex` followed by a space, without any additional formatting or context.

Given this information, the output will be the first element of the list `mex`, followed by a space.

Output: **itm (where itm is the first element of the list mex)**
