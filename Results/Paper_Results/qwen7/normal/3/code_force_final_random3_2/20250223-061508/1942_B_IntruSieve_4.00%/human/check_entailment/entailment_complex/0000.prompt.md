⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the input consists of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: Output State: `minn` is either `maxx` + 1, `maxx` + 2, ..., up to `maxx + n`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing either the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and `minn`, followed by `minn`, or an additional element which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` for each iteration, and `maxx` is the maximum value between `maxx` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each iteration where `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
    #- `minn` will be at least `maxx + 1` and can be as high as `maxx + n`.
    #- `t`, `n`, and `arr` will retain their initial values.
    #- `mex` will contain all the values calculated during the loop, including the absolute differences and the values of `minn` appended when `arr[i] > 0`.
    #- `maxx` will be the highest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `mex` will contain all the absolute differences between each element in `arr` and `minn`, starting from `minn` being `maxx + 1` up to `maxx + n`. Additionally, `minn` will be appended to `mex` for each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and `maxx` will be the maximum value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it calculates a sequence of integers stored in `mex` based on the input array and a variable `minn`. After processing all test cases, it prints the elements of `mex` for each test case. The final state of the program includes the printed sequence of integers for each test case, while the input variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
