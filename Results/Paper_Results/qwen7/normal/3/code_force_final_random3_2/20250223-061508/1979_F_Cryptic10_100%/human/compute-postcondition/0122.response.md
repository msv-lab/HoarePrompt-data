Output State: **`ops` is unchanged except the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation; `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation.**

Explanation: The code checks if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` (denoted as `p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`. If it is, then `p2` (which is not defined in the initial state and would be an error in actual code) is used. Otherwise, `p1` (which is the last tuple in `ops`) appends `v1` to itself. Since `p2` is not defined, the condition `p1[-1] == v2` cannot be true, so the last tuple in `ops` appends `v1` to itself. Therefore, the last tuple in `ops` changes, but `ops` as a whole remains unchanged except for this modification.
