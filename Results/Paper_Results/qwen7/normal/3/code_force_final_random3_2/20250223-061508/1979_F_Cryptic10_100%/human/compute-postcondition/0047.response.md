Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` in their original order, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is the second last element of `vx`, `v2` is the last element of `vx`.**

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` assumes that `q` is a function that extracts two elements from `vx` based on the index provided. Since `len(vx) - 2` gives the index of the second last element in `vx`, `v1` is assigned the second last element of `vx`, and `v2` is assigned the last element of `vx`. The other variables (`ops`, `p1`, and `p2`) remain unchanged.
