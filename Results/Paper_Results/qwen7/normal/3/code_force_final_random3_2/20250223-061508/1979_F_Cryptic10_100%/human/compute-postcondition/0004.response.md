Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-1`, `ops` is an empty list, `v1` is an integer from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from `vx` and `v1 != v2`.**

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` assumes that `q` is a function that returns two distinct elements from the set `vx`. Since `vx` contains integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive), after subtracting 2, `len(vx) - 2` equals `t - 2`. Therefore, `v1` and `v2` are two distinct integers from the set `vx`, which now contains integers from 1 to `t-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
