Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ops` is an empty list, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` in their original order, `p2` is an empty list, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), and `ops` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ops` is a list containing either one or two tuples, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is undefined, `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains the tuple `('v1', v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains the tuples `('v3', 0)` and `('v1', 0)`, where `v3` is the second last element of the original `vx`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ops` is a list containing either the tuple `(v1, v2)` or the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, depending on whether `v2` is greater than 0. `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is the second last element of the updated `vx` minus 2, `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`, and `vx` has had its second last element removed. If `v2` is greater than 0, `v3` is not defined; otherwise, `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, and the second element of the returned tuple from `q(0)` is discarded.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `vx` has one less element than before, `v1` is no longer in `vx`, and `v2` is the new last element of `vx`; `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`. Otherwise, `vx` has one less element than before, `v2` is now the new last element of `vx`, `v3` is removed from `vx`, and `ops` is updated to include two new elements `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
