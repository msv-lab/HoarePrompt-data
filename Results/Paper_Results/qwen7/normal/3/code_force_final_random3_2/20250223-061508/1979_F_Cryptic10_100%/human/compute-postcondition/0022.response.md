Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2` with one or two elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `len(ops)` is increased by 1 if `v2 > 0`; otherwise, `ops` now includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` added to its end.**
