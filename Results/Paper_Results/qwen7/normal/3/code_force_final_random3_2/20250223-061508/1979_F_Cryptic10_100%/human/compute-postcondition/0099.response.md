Postcondition: `p2` contains ['a', 'a'], `ops` is a list containing either [('v1', v2)] if `v2` is greater than 0, or [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)] if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding the last two integers, and `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` if `v2` is not greater than 0.
