Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2` excluding `v3`, `ops` is a list containing elements `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `v1` is an integer from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from `vx` and `v1 != v2`, `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)` and is no longer in `vx`.**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. Since `v3` was previously in `vx` and is now no longer in `vx`, and `v1` is an integer from `vx`, the list `ops` now contains these two tuples. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
