Output State: **`ops` is now ['(v1, v2)'], `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is undefined, the current value of `v2` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Since `ops` was initially an empty list, it is now `['(v1, v2)']`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
