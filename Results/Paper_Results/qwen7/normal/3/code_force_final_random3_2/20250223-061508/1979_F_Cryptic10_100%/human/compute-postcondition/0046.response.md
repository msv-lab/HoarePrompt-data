Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `len(vx) > 2`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `ops` is an empty list.
   - `p1` contains the elements of `vx` in their original order.
   - `p2` is an empty list.
   - `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive).
   - `ops` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `len(vx)` must be greater than 2.
   - Currently, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer. Therefore, the minimum size of `vx` is 1 (if the input integer is 1) and increases as the input integer increases.
   - To satisfy the condition `len(vx) > 2`, the size of `vx` must be at least 3.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the size of `vx` to ensure it is at least 3.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `vx` must contain at least 3 elements.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ops` is an empty list, `p1` contains the elements of `vx` in their original order, `p2` is an empty list, `vx` must contain at least 3 elements, and `ops` is an empty list**.
