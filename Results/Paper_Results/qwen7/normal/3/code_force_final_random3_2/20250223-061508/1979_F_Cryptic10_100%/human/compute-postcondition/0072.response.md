Postcondition: `vx` has one less element than before, `v1` is no longer in `vx`, and `v2` is the new last element of `vx`; `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`. Otherwise, `vx` has one less element than before, `v2` is now the new last element of `vx`, `v3` is removed from `vx`, and `ops` is updated to include two new elements `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
