Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 5`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 1; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`**.

Explanation: The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are updated to reflect the new length of `vx` after it has had one element removed. The precondition that `vx` has one less element than before the removal and `len(vx)` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
