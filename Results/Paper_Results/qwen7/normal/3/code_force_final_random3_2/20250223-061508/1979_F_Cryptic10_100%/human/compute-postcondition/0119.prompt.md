Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p2` contains `['a', 'a']`, `ops` is an empty list, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n where n is an input integer greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `p2` contains ['a', 'a'], `ops` is a list containing either [('v1', v2)] if `v2` is greater than 0, or [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)] if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding the last two integers, and `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` if `v2` is not greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`, and `vx` has one less element than before the removal. If `v2 > 0`, then `ops` has an additional element `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, and `ops` is added with `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `v1` is `len(vx) - 5`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 1; if `v2 > 0`, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `v1` is `len(vx) - 6`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, `len(vx)` is decreased by 1, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, and `_` is the discarded return value of `q(0)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
