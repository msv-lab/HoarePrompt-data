Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`, `vx` has one less element than before the removal, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)` and `_` is the discarded return value from `q(0)`**.

Explanation: The initial state shows that `v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, and `vx` has one less element than before the removal. The code `v3, _ = q(0)` calls the function `q` with argument `0` and assigns the first return value to `v3` while discarding the second return value (denoted by `_`). Since no specific values or types for `q(0)` are given, `v3` is simply the return value of `q(0)`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are updated based on the new length of `vx`, which now has one less element.
