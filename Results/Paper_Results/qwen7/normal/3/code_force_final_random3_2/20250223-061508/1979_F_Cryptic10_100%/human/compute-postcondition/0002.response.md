Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code creates a set `vx` containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) and initializes an empty list `ops`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
