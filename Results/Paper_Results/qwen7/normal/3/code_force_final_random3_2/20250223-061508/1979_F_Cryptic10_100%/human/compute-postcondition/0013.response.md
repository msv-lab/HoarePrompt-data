Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2` (possibly excluding one element), `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` is an integer from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from `vx` and `v1 != v2`, and if the else part is executed, `v2` is less than or equal to 0 and `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)` and is no longer in `vx`.**
