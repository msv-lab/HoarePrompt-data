Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it initializes a set of vertices and an operations list.
3. It then enters a loop where it removes vertices based on the degree and connectivity information obtained from the queries.
4. The operations list is used to keep track of the vertices that were removed and their connections.
5. After the loop, it reconstructs the Hamiltonian path by reversing the operations and appending the remaining vertices.
6. The final output is a sequence of integers representing the Hamiltonian path, which is formatted correctly.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct logic and constraints. It interacts with the input as expected and constructs the Hamiltonian path using the provided queries.

Correctness: **True**
