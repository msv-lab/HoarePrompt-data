Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t-2` with one element removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples where either `(v1, v2)` or `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are included, `v1` is an integer from `vx`, `v2` is an integer from `vx` and `v1 != v2`, `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code `vx.remove(v1)` removes the element `v1` from the set `vx`. Since `v1` is an integer from `vx`, after removing `v1`, `vx` will contain all integers from 1 to `t-2` except for `v1`. All other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
