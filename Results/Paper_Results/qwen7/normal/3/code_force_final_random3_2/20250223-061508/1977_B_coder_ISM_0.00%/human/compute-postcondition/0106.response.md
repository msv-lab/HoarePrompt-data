Output State: **`i` is 30, `length` is greater than 30, `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `s[1]` is '1', ..., `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '1' if `s[29]` was '-1' and `s[28]` was '1' during the last iteration, otherwise `s[30]` remains '1', `nalla` is 31, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
