Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(30)`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: We know that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented from its previous value. Since the loop starts with `i` as 0, if it has already run through some iterations, `i` would be the current iteration number.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 30.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 30. If `i` is currently 29 (the maximum value before it reaches 30), then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 29.

5. **Maintain other states**: The other states (`t`, `nalla`, `x`, and `s`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 29 (since it needs to be less than 30 for the loop to continue).
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
- `nalla` remains 0.
- `x` remains the same input integer.
- `s` remains a list that is updated based on the condition `(x & pow(2, i))`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list, `i` is 29**.
