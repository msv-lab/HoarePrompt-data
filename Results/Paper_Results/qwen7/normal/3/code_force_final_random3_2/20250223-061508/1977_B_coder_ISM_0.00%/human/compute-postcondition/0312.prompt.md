Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 30, `length` is greater than 30, `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `s[1]` is '1', ..., `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '1' if `s[29]` was '-1' and `s[28]` was '1' during the last iteration, otherwise `s[30]` remains '1'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be 30 because the loop increments `i` from 1 to the original length of `s`, which is greater than 30. The length of `s` remains greater than 30 as the loop does not modify it. The values of `s[0]` to `s[29]` remain '1' unless they were changed during the loop's execution, but based on the given conditions, they should remain '1'. For `s[30]`, it will be '1' if `s[29]` was '-1' and `s[28]` was '1' during the last iteration, otherwise, it remains '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 30, length is 31, `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '1', `s[31]` is '1', and the rest of the elements in `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 31, `length` is 31, `s` is a list of 31 elements where the 29th and 30th elements are '-1', and the 31st element is '1' if it was '1' before the loop started, otherwise it remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
