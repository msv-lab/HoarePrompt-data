Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is used in the `range(30)` function.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 0 (as `range(30)` generates numbers from 0 to 29), we need to set `i` to 0.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 30. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run 30 times without any additional conditions on `i`.

4. **Consider other variables**: The variables `t`, `nalla`, `x`, and `s` are not directly involved in the loop head. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's execution.

5. **Formulate the final state**: Based on the above steps, the only adjustment needed is for the variable `i` to be set to 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
