Output State: **`i` is less than 29, `n` is 29, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `flag`) remain unchanged. Since the initial condition stated that `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`, and `s[i]` was updated to '-1', it follows that `s[i + 1]` is also '-1'.
