Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is '-1'**.

Explanation: The code sets `flag` to 1, which changes its value from either 0 or 1 to 1. The values of `i` and `s[0]` remain unchanged. Additionally, `s[1]` is explicitly mentioned to be changed to '-1', so its value is updated accordingly.
