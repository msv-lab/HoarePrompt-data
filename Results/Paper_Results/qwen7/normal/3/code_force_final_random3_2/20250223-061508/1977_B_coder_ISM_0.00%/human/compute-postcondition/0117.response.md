Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is 30, `s` is a list containing '1'**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `s` was not initially defined in the context provided, it is assumed to be a list (or it is initialized to be a list before this line of code). After appending `'1'` to `s`, the list `s` now contains the element `'1'`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.
