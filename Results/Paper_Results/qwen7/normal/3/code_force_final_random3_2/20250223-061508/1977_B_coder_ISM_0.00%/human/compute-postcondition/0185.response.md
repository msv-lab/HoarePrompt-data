Output State: **`i` is 29, `nalla` is 31, `flag` is 1, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', `s[31]` is '1', `length` is 1**

The variable `length` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other number). Since no initial value for `length` was given, we assume it was 0 before the code execution. After executing `length += 1`, `length` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
