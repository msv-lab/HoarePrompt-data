Output State: `i` is 29, `nalla` is 31, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[i]` is '0', and `s[i + 1]` is '0' or '1' based on the value of `flag`.

Explanation: After the loop completes its 29 iterations (since `i` ranges from 0 to 28), `i` will be 29. The variable `nalla` remains unchanged at 31. The `flag` variable can either be 0 or 1 after the loop, but regardless of the value of `flag`, `s[i]` (which corresponds to `s[29]`) will be '0'. The value of `s[i + 1]` (which corresponds to `s[30]`) will depend on the final state of `flag`: if `flag` is 1, `s[30]` will be '0'; if `flag` is 0, `s[30]` will match `s[29]`, which is '0'.
