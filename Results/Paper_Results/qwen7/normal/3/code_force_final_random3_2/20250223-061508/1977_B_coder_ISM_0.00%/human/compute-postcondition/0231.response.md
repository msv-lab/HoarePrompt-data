Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 30, `length` will still be 30, `s` will be a list of 30 elements, and `nalla` will still be 31. The list `s` will contain either '1' or '0' based on whether `x` is divisible by \(2^i\) for each `i` from 0 to 29.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop completes all 30 iterations, the variable `i` will have reached its upper limit of 30. The variable `length` remains unchanged at 30. The list `s` will consist of 30 elements, where each element is either '1' or '0'. This depends on the binary representation of the integer `x`. Specifically, '1' will be appended to `s` if `x` has a 1 in the `i`-th bit position (from right to left, starting at 0), and '0' will be appended otherwise. The variable `nalla` remains unchanged at 31, as it was not affected by the loop.
