Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `nalla` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list of length 30, where each element corresponds to whether the bit at position `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 29) in the binary representation of `x` is set to 1. If the bit is set to 1, the corresponding element in `s` is '1'; otherwise, it is '0'.

After executing the loop, the list `s` contains the binary representation of `x` (in reverse order), with each bit represented as '1' or '0'. The `print(*s)` statement will print these elements separated by spaces.

For example, if `x` is 13 (binary representation is 1101), then `s` would be `['0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']`.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of '1's and '0's representing the binary form of `x` in reverse order.

Output: **'0' '0' '0' ... '0' '1' '1' '0' (30 zeros followed by the binary representation of x in reverse order)**
