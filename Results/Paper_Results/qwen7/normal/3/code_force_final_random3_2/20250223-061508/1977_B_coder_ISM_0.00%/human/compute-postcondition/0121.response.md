Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(30)`. This means the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 29`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `i` is 30.
   - `s` is a list.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < 30`. Since `i` is currently 30, the condition `i < 30` is false, and the loop will not execute again.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The variable `i` will not change because the loop does not execute again.
   - The variable `x` remains unchanged.
   - The list `s` remains unchanged.

Given that the loop does not execute again, the state remains the same as the previous iteration.

**Final State**:
- `x` is an integer.
- `i` is 30.
- `s` is a list.

However, since the loop does not execute again, the state does not change from the previous iteration.

**Answer**:
State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is 30, and `s` is a list.**
