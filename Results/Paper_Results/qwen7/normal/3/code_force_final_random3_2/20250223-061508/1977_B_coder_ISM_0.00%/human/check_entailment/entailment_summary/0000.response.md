Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program initializes an empty list `s` and sets the length to 30 bits.
3. It then iterates through the bits of the input number `x` and appends '1' or '0' to the list `s` based on whether the bit is set or not.
4. After constructing the initial binary representation, the program applies several rules to modify the list `s`:
   - If a '1' is found consecutively, it changes the first '1' to '-1' and sets a flag.
   - If the flag is set and a '0' is encountered, it changes the '0' to '1'.
   - It ensures no consecutive non-zero elements ('1' or '-1') exist.
5. Finally, it adjusts the length and prints the modified list `s` and its length.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the rules specified in the problem statement. It correctly constructs the binary representation, applies the necessary modifications to ensure no consecutive non-zero elements, and outputs the result as required.

Correctness: **True**
