Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace, and `t` is greater than 0.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` equals `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` is greater than 0, confirming that there were at least one iteration to begin with. The variable `possible` is `True`, which means that during the loop's execution, the condition where `c[i]` was found to be equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` was met for at least one `i` within the range of the loop. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace, and `t` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop was executed at least once.
