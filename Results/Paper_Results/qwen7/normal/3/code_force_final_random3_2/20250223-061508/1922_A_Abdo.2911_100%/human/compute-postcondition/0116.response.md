Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` retains its original value, strings `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, strings `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `possible`, `a`, `c`, and `t`) are not affected by this operation.
