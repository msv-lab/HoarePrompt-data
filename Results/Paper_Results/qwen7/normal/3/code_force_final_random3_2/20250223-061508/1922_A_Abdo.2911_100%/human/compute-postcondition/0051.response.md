Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0. After all iterations of the loop, if `possible` was never set to `True` within the loop, it remains `False`. If `possible` was set to `True` at any point during the iterations, it remains `True`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` up to index `i-1` will reflect the conditions checked within the loop, while the elements from index `i` onwards will not be checked and thus their original values in `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain unchanged.
