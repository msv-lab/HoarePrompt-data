Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user, `c` is the stripped input string from user, `possible` is `False`**.

The variable `possible` is set to `False`, which means it is now known to be `False`. All other variables retain their initial states.
