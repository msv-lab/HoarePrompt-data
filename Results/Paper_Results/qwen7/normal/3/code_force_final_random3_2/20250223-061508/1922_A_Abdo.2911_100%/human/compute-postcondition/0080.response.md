Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`**.

The code sets the variable `possible` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
