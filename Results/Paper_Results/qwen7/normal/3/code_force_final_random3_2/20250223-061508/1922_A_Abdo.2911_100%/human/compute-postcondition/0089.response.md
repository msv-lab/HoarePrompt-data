Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the conditions and values from the initial state.
