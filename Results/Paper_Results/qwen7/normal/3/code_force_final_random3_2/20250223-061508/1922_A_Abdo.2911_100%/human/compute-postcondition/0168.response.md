Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. Based on these inputs, the function processes each test case and returns a specific output for each case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and returns a result for each test case without needing to see the actual implementation details.
