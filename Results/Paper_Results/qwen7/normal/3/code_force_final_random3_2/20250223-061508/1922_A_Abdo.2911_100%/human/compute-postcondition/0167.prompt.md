Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    possible = False
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if c[i] != a[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
            continue
        else:
            possible = True
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. After all iterations of the loop, `possible` remains the same (either `True` if it was set to `True` at any point during the loop, or `False` if it was never set to `True`). The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` up to index `i-1` will reflect the conditions checked within the loop, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. The value of `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `possible` retains its original value (either True or False), indicating whether at some point during the loop's execution, the condition where `c[i]` was found to be equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` was met for at least one `i` within the range of the loop. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace. The elements from index `i` onwards retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0. In both cases, the loop has completed all its iterations without finding a case where `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, ensuring `possible` remains `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
