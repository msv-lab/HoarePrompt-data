Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` retains its original value, strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace, elements from index `i` onwards retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `possible`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
