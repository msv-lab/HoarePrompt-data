Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. After all iterations of the loop, `possible` remains the same (either `True` if it was set to `True` at any point during the loop, or `False` if it was never set to `True`). The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` up to index `i-1` will reflect the conditions checked within the loop, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values.
