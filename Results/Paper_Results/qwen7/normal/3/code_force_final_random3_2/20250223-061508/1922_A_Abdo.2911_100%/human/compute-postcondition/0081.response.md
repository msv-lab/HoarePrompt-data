Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the `break` statement is effectively breaking out of the context where it was last used. The values of the variables `possible`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and the condition regarding `c[i]` remain unchanged.
