Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `possible` retains its original value (either True or False).
   - Strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace.
   - Elements from index `i` onwards retain their original values.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - This means `n` must decrease by 1 to allow `i` to be less than `n`.
   - `t` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` must be less than `n`, so `n` should be decreased by 1.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` retains its original value, strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings stripped of whitespace, elements from index `i` onwards retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
