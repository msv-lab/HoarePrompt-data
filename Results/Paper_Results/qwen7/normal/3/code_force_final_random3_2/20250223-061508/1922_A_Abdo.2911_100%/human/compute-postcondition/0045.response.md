Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `possible`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables retain their initial states, and the break statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional we were inside.
