Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `possible`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional was specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one.
