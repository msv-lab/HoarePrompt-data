Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[1]` must also be equal to `a[1]` (or no change occurs). If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True if `c[1]` is neither equal to `a[1]` nor `b[1]`.
