Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0. After all iterations of the loop, `possible` remains either `False` (if it was never set to `True` during the loop) or `True` (if it was set to `True` at any point during the iterations). The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` up to index `i-1` will reflect the conditions checked within the loop, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values.
