Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`, and either we break out of the most internal loop or statement if `count > 1`, or we continue the loop or statement we were inside if `count <= 1`.**
