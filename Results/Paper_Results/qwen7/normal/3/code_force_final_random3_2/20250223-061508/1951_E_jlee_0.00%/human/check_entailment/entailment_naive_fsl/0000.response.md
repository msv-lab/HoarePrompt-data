Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
aabbccddeeff
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
2
aabb ccdd ee ff
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
```

The issue arises because the program checks for the first non-palindromic pair and attempts to split the string accordingly. In the given example, the string `aabbccddeeff` can be split into non-palindromic substrings `aabb`, `ccdd`, and `eeff`. However, the program fails to recognize this and incorrectly outputs `NO`.

To fix this, the program needs to check all possible splits and ensure that at least one valid partition exists before concluding that the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
