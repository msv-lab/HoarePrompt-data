Output State: **`done` is True, `count` is either `j` or `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `done` and `count`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the values of `done` and `count` remain the same as their initial states.
