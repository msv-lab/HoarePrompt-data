Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement is fixed and does not depend on any variable values, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **YES**
