Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 0, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, and the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`. If `count` is greater than 0, then `count` is reset to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `done` is True, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s. In both cases (whether `count2 == count` or `count2 > count`), the values of the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `done` is True, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is updated to `j`, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, we break out of the loop. Otherwise, we continue checking the symmetry of the string or reset `count2` to 0. If `s[j]` equals `x`, `count2` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
