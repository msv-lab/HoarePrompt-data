Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` remains True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is not greater than `count`, the conditions remain unchanged.
