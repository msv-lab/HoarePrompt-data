Given the initial state, we know that `done` is `True` and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `count` is set to `j`. 

The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

Here, `string[:j]` represents the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j`, and `string[j:]` represents the substring of `string` starting from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

Since `count` is `j`, we can directly substitute `j` with `count` in the print statement. Therefore, the output will be the two substrings of `string` split at index `j`.

Output: **string[:count] string[count:]**
