State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
2. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. Initially, `i` is 0 (the starting value of `range(t)`), but it will become 1 after the first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 1 for the first iteration.
