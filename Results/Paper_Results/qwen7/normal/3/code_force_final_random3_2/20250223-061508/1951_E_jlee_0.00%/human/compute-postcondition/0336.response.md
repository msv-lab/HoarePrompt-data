Output State: **`done` is True, `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`, `count2` is 0, and we continue the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no change in the values of the variables `done`, `count`, `count2`, and the condition for breaking out of the loop remains the same, the only change is that the loop continues.
