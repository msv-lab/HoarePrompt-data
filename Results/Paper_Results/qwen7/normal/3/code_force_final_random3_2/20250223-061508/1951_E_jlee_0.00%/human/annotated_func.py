#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: All iterations of the loop have completed, with `i` being equal to `t`, `done` is True, `count` and `count2` remaining as their final values from the last iteration, `string` is the last input string processed, `s` is a list representation of `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, and `x` is the first character of `string`. The loop has processed all input strings up to the `t`th string, and for each string, it determined whether the string meets certain conditions and printed the result accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` meets specific conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if applicable. If the string can be split into two parts such that the first part is a palindrome and the second part is a single non-matching character, it also prints the indices indicating the split. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
