Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and the first element of `s` is now the first character of `string`. If the count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`, the condition remains as described.
