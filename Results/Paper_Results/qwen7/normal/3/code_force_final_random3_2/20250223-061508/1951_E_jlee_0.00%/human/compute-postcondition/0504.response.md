Based on the initial state provided, we need to determine the values of `string`, `j`, and `n` to understand what will be printed. However, the initial state does not explicitly provide these values. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Print Statement**: 
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```
   This statement prints two parts of the string `string`: 
   - The substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j-1`.
   - The substring starting from the character at index `j-1` to the end of the string.

2. **Variables and Their States**:
   - `s` is mentioned, but it is not clear if `s` is the same as `string`. Assuming `s` and `string` refer to the same object, we focus on `string`.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `done` is True, but this doesn't affect the print statement directly.
   - `count` and `count2` remain the same, but their values are not relevant to the print statement.

3. **Determining the Printed Substrings**:
   - The first part of the print statement is `string[:j - 1]`, which includes all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j-1`.
   - The second part of the print statement is `string[j - 1:]`, which includes all characters from the character at index `j-1` to the end of the string.

Given that the exact values of `string`, `j`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the substrings in terms of `j` and the length of `string`.

Output: **string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:]**
