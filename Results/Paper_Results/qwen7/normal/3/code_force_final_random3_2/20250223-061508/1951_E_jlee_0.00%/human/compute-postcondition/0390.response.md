Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that the character at index `j` of the string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of the same string `s`. This means that the string `s` does not have a symmetric character at these positions. Therefore, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string "YES" without any dependence on the specific characters or indices provided in the initial state.
