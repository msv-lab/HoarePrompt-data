Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is the same, `done` is True. `count` is either the same as the original `count` or `j` (if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count` reaches 1), and `count2` is either the same as the original `count2` or 0 (depending on whether the condition inside the if statement is met or not).
