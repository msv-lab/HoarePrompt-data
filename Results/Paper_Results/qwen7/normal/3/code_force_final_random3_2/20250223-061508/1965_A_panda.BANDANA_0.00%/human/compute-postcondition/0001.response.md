Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, the loop will start executing when `i` is 0 and continue until `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will start with `i` being 0, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^5`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer.

We need to adjust the state to reflect the initial values of `i` and `t` before the loop starts executing.

**State:**
- `t` is an input integer.
- `i` must be 0 (since the loop starts with `i` initialized to 0).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 0**
