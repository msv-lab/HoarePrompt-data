Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is an input integer again, `m` is the length of the list `l` and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

In this case, the code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The second assignment to `n` overwrites the previous value of `n` which was an input integer, so now `n` holds the value of the new input integer.
