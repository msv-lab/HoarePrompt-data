The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, an integer n, and a list of n integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it checks if the number 1 exists in the list of stones. If 1 is found, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case directly.
