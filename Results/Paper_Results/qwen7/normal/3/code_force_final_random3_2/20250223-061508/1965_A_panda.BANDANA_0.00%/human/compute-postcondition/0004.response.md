Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`.**

The code creates a set `e` from the list `l`, which removes any duplicate elements from `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
