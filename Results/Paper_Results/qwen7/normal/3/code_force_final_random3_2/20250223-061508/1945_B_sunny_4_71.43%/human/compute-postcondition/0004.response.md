Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `A` is the value of `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is the value of `int(m / b) + 1`**.

This means that the value of `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` have been updated according to the given operations. Specifically, `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`. All other variables retain their initial states.
