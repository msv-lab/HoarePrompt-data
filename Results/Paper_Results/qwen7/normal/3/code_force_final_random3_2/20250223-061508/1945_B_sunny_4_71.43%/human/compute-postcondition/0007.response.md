Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `A` is the value of `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is the value of `int(m / b) + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. It does not change the values of `A`, `B`, or `t`. The values of `A` and `B` are still defined as `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` respectively, but since `m` is now updated to the new value entered by the user, these expressions will yield new values based on the updated `m`. The variable `t` is also updated to `t - 1`, but its exact value depends on the initial value of `t`, which is not specified in the initial state.
