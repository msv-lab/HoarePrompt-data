Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `b` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `m` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `A` is the value of `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `B` is the value of `int(m / b) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `A` is the value of `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is the value of `int(m / b) + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`**
