Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `t` is greater than 0, `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`, `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `B` to `int(m / b) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `B` is now calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`, while `a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, and `A` retain their original values.
