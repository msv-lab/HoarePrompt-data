Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the code calculates how many fireworks each installation would launch within `m` minutes but does not consider the overlap of visibility periods of fireworks launched at different intervals.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. We then need to calculate how many fireworks are visible in the sky at any given moment within the interval `[0, m]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the LCM of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks visible at any given moment
        max_visible = 0
        for i in range(0, m + 1, lcm_ab):
            count_a = (m - i) // a + 1
            count_b = (m - i) // b + 1
            max_visible = max(max_visible, count_a + count_b - 1)
        
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the LCM of `a` and `b` and then iterates through all possible starting points for fireworks to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given moment.
