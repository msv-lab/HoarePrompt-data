Output State: The loop will execute `cnt` times, which is 1 time based on the given information. After the loop executes, `ans` is a list where each element is one less than the previous element, starting from the initial state where `ans` contains all elements from the list `a`. The last element of `ans` will be `a[0] - cnt`.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `ans` will be a list where each element is reduced by 1 for every iteration of the loop, starting from the original elements of list `a`. Since the loop runs only once (`cnt` is 1), each element in `ans` will be exactly 1 less than its corresponding element in the original list `a`.
