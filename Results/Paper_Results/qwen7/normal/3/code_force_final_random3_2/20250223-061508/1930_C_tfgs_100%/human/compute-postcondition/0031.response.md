Output State: **`i` is 1, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `cur` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` is a list that now includes the value of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `ans`. Since `i` was previously 0, after this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `cnt` and `cur` are decreased by `adv`, which remains unchanged from the initial state. The list `ans` now contains the value of `a[0]` (since `i` was 0 before the increment).
