Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variable `n` is mentioned to be an input integer but is not altered by the given code.
