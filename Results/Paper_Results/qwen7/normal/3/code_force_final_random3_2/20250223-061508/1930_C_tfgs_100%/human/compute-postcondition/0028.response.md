Output State: **`adv` must be greater than 0; `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `cur` is decreased by `adv`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is decreased by the value of `adv`. Since `cnt` was already decreased by `adv` before this line of code, the precondition that `adv` must be greater than 0 still holds. The value of `cnt` is now further decreased by `adv`, and `cur` is also decreased by `adv`.
