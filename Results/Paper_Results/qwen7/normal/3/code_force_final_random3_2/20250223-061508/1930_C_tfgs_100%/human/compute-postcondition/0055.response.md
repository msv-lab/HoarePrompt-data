Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `adv-1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 0
   - `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`
   - `ans` contains `a[1] - j - 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < adv`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `j` will become `1`.
   - `adv` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `j`. Since `ans` currently contains `a[1] - j - 1`, after the next iteration, `ans` will contain `a[1] - 1 - 1 = a[1] - 2`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is still 2.
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `adv` remains `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`.
   - `ans` now contains `a[1] - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 2`**
