Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[2] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 4`, `ans` now also contains `a[1] - 4 - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` is `cur - adv`**.

Explanation: The code `cur -= adv` subtracts the value of `adv` from `cur`. The value of `adv` is defined as `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, which remains unchanged. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `ans`, `cnt`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
