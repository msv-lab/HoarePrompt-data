Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and it ranges over the length of the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cnt` is decreased by `adv`.
   - `cur` is decreased by `adv`.
   - `ans` is a list that now includes the value of `a[i]`.
   - `cur` is updated to `cur + counter[a[i]]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The conditions for the loop to continue are that `i` must be less than the length of `a`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `cnt` will be decreased by `adv`.
   - `cur` will be decreased by `adv`.
   - `ans` will include the value of `a[2]`.
   - `cur` will be updated to `cur + counter[a[2]]`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `cur` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` is a list that now includes the value of `a[2]`, `cur` is updated to `cur + counter[a[2]]***.
