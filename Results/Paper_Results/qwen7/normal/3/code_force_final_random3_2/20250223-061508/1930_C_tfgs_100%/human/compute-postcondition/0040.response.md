Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` and the range `range(adv)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `cnt` is decreased by `adv`.
   - `cur` is decreased by `adv`.
   - `ans` is a list that now includes the value of `a[2] - 1`.
   - `adv` is equal to `min(a[1] - a[2], cnt, cur)`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `ans` is updated to include `a[2 - 1] - 1` which is `a[1] - 1`.

3. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 0 (since it was 1 in the previous iteration).
   - `adv` remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it, but based on the given information, it does not change within the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `j` should be set to 0.
- `adv` remains as it is.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `cur` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` is a list that now includes the value of `a[2] - 1`, `adv` is equal to `min(a[1] - a[2], cnt, cur)`, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated to include `a[2 - 1] - 1` which is `a[1] - 1`.**
