Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `adv` is `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[2] - 3`, `ans` contains `a[1] - 4`, `ans` now also contains `a[1] - 4 - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt -= adv` subtracts the value of `adv` from `cnt`. Since `adv` is defined as `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, it remains unchanged. The value of `cnt` is reduced by the value of `adv`. The value of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The `ans` list is updated to include `a[1] - 3`, `a[2] - 3`, `a[1] - 4`, and `a[1] - 5` (which is `a[1] - 4 - 1`).
