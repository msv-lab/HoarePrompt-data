Output State: **`adv` must be greater than 0; `cnt` is decreased by `adv`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt -= adv` decreases the value of `cnt` by `adv`. Since `adv` must be greater than 0, `cnt` will be reduced by the exact amount of `adv`. The initial conditions for `ans` remain unchanged because the code does not affect `ans`. Therefore, the sequence in `ans` still starts from `a[i - 1] - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`.
