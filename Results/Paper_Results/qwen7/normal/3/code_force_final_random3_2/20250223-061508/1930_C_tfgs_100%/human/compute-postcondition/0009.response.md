Output State: The value of `a[i]` for each valid index `i` will be the original value of `a[i]` plus the sum of `(i + 1)` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, each element `a[i]` (where `0 â‰¤ i < n`) will have been incremented by `i + 1` for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the final value of `a[i]` will be the initial value of `a[i]` plus the sum of the series `(1 + 2 + ... + n)`, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. 

So, the output state can be described as: Each element in the list `a` is incremented by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers starting from 1.
