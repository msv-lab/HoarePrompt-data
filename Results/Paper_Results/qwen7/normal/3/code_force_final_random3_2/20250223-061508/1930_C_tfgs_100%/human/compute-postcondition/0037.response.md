Output State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `cur` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` is a list that now includes the value of `a[2]` and `a[2] - j - 1`, `adv` is equal to `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `j` is 0**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 2, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `cur` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` includes the value of `a[2]`, `adv` is calculated as `min(a[1] - a[2] - 1, cnt, cur)`, and `j` is 0.
- The code `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends the value of `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. So, it appends `a[1] - j - 1` to `ans`.
- After appending, `ans` now includes both `a[2]` and `a[1] - j - 1`.
- The values of `cnt`, `cur`, `adv`, and `j` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them further.
