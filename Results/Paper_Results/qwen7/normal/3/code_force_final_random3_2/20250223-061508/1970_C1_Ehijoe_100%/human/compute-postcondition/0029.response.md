Output State: **`nodes` must have at least one key, `key` is appended to the `ends` list.**

Explanation: The code `ends.append(key)` appends the value of `key` to the list `ends`. The initial conditions state that `nodes` must have at least one key, `key` will be the next key in the `nodes` dictionary, and `ends` will either contain or not contain the key based on the condition of the list associated with the current key. After executing the code, `key` is added to the `ends` list, but the other conditions remain unchanged.
