Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing all the nodes traversed from `s` to `e`, and `curr` is equal to `e`. The variable `tree` now includes the node `e` appended to its end.**

This means that the `tree` list now contains all the nodes from the starting node `s` to the ending node `e`, and both `prev` and `curr` are pointing to the node `e`. The variables `s` and `e` retain their initial values from the `ends` list, and `tree` now has one additional node `e` appended to it.
