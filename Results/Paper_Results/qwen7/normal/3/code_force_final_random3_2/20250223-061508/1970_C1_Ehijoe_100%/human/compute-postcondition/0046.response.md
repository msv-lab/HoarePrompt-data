Output State: **`prev` is `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `curr` is `nodes[curr][0]`, and `nodes[curr][0]` is not equal to `prev`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `nodes[curr][0]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `nodes[curr][0]` is not equal to `prev` is still valid.
