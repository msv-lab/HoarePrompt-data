Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `nodes[v]` now contains `u`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. The initial values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is also preserved.
