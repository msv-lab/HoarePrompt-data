Output State: **`prev` is `s`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `curr` is `nodes[s][0]` and `curr` is not equal to `e`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `curr` to the `tree` list. Initially, `tree` contains only the element `s`. After executing `tree.append(curr)`, `tree` now contains both `s` and `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
