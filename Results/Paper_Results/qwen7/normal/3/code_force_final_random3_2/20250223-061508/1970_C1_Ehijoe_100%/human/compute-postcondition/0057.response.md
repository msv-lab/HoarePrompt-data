The loop condition is `curr != e`. This means the loop continues as long as `curr` is not equal to `e`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `prev` is equal to `curr` appended to `tree`
- `curr` is `nodes[curr][1]`
- `s` is the first element from the `ends` list
- `e` is the second element from the `ends` list
- `curr` is not equal to `e`

For the loop to execute one more time, `curr` must still not be equal to `e`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `curr` to ensure it remains not equal to `e`.

State: **`prev` is equal to `curr` appended to `tree`, `curr` is `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `curr` is not equal to `e`**
