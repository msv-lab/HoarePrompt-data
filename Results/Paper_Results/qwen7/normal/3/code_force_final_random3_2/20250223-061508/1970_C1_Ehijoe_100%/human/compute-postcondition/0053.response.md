Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`, and `prev` is now equal to `curr`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = curr` simply assigns the current value of `curr` to `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` is updated to the current value of `curr`, while `s`, `e`, `tree`, and the relationship between `curr` and `nodes[s][0]` remain as they were initially.
