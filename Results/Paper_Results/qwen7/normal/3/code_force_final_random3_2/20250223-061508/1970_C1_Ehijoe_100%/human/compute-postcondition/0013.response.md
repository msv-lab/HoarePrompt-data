Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains `u`, `u` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `v` is assigned the value of the second input integer.**

This means that the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The variables `u` and `v` are updated to the values of the two integers inputted by the user, and `nodes[v]` is updated to contain the value of `u`.
