Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`, and `curr` is not equal to `e`; `tree` now includes `curr` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(curr)` appends the value of `curr` to the list `tree`. Since `curr` was already in the list (as the second element), appending it again does not change its contents but adds another reference to `curr` within the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
