Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains all integers `u` that are connected to `v` through the edges added during the loop iterations, `ends` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        ends.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `nodes` must have at least one key. If the length of the list associated with the key is exactly 1, then `ends` contains the key that was appended. Otherwise, no change occurs in `ends`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `nodes` must have at least one key. If the length of the list associated with `key` is exactly 1, then `ends` contains the key that was appended. If the length of the list associated with `key` is not 1, then `ends` does not contain the key that was appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nodes` must have at least one key. If the length of the list associated with `key` in `nodes` is 1, then `key` is appended to the `ends` list. Otherwise, `key` remains unchanged in the `ends` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
