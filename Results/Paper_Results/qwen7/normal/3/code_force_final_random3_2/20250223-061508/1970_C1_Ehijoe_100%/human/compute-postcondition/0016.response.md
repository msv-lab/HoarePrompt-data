Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least `n`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains all integers `u` for which there was an edge between `v` and `u` during the loop iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`. The variable `n` will still hold the value it was initialized with, but it must be at least `n` (which is the final value of `n` after the loop). The variables `u` and `v` will be the most recently input integers. The `nodes` dictionary will contain lists of all nodes connected to each node, reflecting all the edges added during the loop iterations.
