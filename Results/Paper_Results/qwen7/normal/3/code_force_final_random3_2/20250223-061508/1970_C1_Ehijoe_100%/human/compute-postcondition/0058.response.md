Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr` appended to `tree`, `curr` is `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `curr` is not equal to `e`, `tree` now includes `curr` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the current node (`curr`) to the `tree` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` remains equal to `curr` appended to `tree`, `curr` remains as `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` remains as the first element from the `ends` list, `e` remains as the second element from the `ends` list, and `curr` is still not equal to `e`. The `tree` list now includes the new value of `curr` appended to it.
