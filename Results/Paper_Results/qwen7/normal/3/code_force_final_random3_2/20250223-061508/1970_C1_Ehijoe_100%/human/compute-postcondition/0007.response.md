Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains `u`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contains `v`, so after executing the code, `nodes[v]` will contain `u`. The values of `n`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
