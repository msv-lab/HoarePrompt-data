Output State: **`d` is increased by 3, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `c` is the length of `s`, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`, `ma` is equal to `len(s) - d - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ma` to `len(s) - d - 1`. The other variables (`d`, `j`, `c`, `mi`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
