Postcondition: `d` is increased by 3, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `c` is the length of `s`, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`, `ma` is equal to `len(s) - d - 1`. If `j` equals 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` does not equal 'B', no changes are made to the variables.
