Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white.
2. The given program defines a function `func_1()` that calculates the distance between the first and last black cells ('B') in the string `s`, and then adds 2 to this distance.
3. However, the logic in `func_1()` does not correctly identify the minimum segment length. Specifically:
   - The function only checks for the first and last 'B' in the string and calculates the distance between them plus 2.
   - This approach does not account for scenarios where there are multiple segments of black cells that could be covered by a smaller segment.
4. For example, in the string "WBBWBW", the function would calculate the distance between the first and last 'B' as 4, but the correct answer should be 4 (painting the segment from the 2nd to the 5th cell).
5. The correct approach would be to find the longest sequence of consecutive 'W's (white cells) and add 1 to its length. This ensures that any black cells within this segment are also covered.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
