Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must have at least one 'B'; `j` is the first character in `s` and its current value is 'B'; `c` is 1; `mi` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `j`, `c`, or `mi`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
