Output State: **The string `s` is a sequence of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B'. The variable `j` is the last character in `s` that is 'B'. The variable `c` is equal to the length of `s`. The variable `mi` is equal to the index (position) of the first 'B' in `s`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `c` will be incremented once for each character in the string `s`, making it equal to the length of `s`. The variable `mi` will hold the index of the first 'B' encountered in `s`, as the loop breaks immediately upon finding the first 'B'. The variables `ma`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `d`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state because they are not modified within the loop.
