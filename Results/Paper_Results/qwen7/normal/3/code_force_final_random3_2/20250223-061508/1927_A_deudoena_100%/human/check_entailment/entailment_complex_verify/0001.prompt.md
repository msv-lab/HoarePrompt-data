You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: The string `s` is a sequence of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B'. The variable `j` is the last character in `s` that is 'B'. The variable `c` is equal to the length of `s`. The variable `mi` is equal to the index (position) of the first 'B' in `s`.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: The string `s` is a sequence of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B'. The variable `j` is the last 'B' in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, the variable `c` is the length of `s`, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`, and `ma` is equal to `len(s) - d - (number of iterations - 1)`. The variable `d` has been incremented by the total number of iterations of the loop.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the index of the last 'B' in the reversed string and the index of the first 'B' in the original string, plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', and calculates the difference between the index of the last 'B' in the reversed string and the index of the first 'B' in the original string, then adds 2 to this difference. The function returns this computed value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the logic:
     - `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0.
     - `m` is read as the length of the strip.
     - `s` is read as the string representing the strip.
     - `c` and `d` are used to count the positions where 'B' (black) is encountered.
     - The first loop finds the index of the first 'B' from the start (`mi`).
     - The second loop finds the index of the last 'B' from the end (`ma`).
     - The function returns `ma - mi + 2`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic to find the first and last 'B' is correct.
   - However, the calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment length is calculated as the difference between the indices plus one.
   - Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are multiple segments of 'B' in the middle of the strip. It only considers the first and last 'B'.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the longest sequence of consecutive 'W' (white) cells and calculate the length of the segment that needs to be painted to cover any remaining 'B' cells. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_white_length = 0
    current_white_length = 0
    
    for j in s:
        if j == 'W':
            current_white_length += 1
        else:
            max_white_length = max(max_white_length, current_white_length)
            current_white_length = 0
    
    max_white_length = max(max_white_length, current_white_length)
    
    # Calculate the minimum length to paint
    min_paint_length = m - max_white_length
    return min_paint_length + 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the segment length. The provided solution above fixes the issue and correctly computes the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.
