Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not pass any arguments to it. This is incorrect because `func_1()` expects no arguments based on the problem statement, but it internally reads `m` and `s`, which should be passed as arguments.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - `func_1()` is defined to take no parameters, but it reads `m` and `s` inside the function, which are not passed as arguments. This is a logical error.

3. **Logic Inside `func_1()`**:
   - The function initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0.
   - It reads an integer `m` and a string `s`.
   - It uses two loops to find the first occurrence of 'B' from the start (`mi`) and the last occurrence of 'B' from the end (`ma`).
   - It calculates the minimum segment length required to turn all cells white by computing `ma - mi + 2`.

4. **Calculation of Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct formula to find the minimum segment length should be `max(ma, mi)` because the goal is to cover the farthest black cell from both ends.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(m, s):
    mi = float('inf')
    ma = -float('inf')
    
    for j in s:
        if j == 'B':
            mi = min(mi, s.index(j))
            ma = max(ma, s.index(j))
    
    return ma - mi + 1

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(m, s))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- `func_1(m, s)` takes the length `m` and the string `s` as arguments.
- It initializes `mi` and `ma` to infinity and negative infinity, respectively.
- It iterates through the string `s` to find the indices of the first and last 'B' characters.
- It returns the length of the segment needed to turn all cells white, which is `ma - mi + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the lack of parameter passing to `func_1()`. The corrected program addresses this issue and implements the logic correctly.

**Correctness: False**
