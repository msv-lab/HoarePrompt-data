Postcondition: `d` is increased by 1, `s` is a sequence of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B', `j` is the last 'B' in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `c` is the length of `s`, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`, and `ma` is the length of `s` - `d`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
