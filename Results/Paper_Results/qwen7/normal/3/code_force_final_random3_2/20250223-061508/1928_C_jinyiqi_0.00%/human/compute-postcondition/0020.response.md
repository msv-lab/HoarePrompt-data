Output State: **The program returns a list that combines the quotients when `x` is divided by each of its divisors from the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) down to 1, followed by the divisors themselves.**

This means the program returns a list where the first half consists of the quotients obtained by dividing `x` by each of its divisors starting from the largest (less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\)) down to 1, and the second half consists of the divisors themselves in descending order.
