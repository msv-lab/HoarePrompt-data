### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Constraints**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received during the settling.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates all divisors of a given number `x` and returns them in a specific order: from the largest divisor less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) down to 1, followed by the corresponding quotients.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It iterates through all integers from 1 to \(\sqrt{x}\) and checks if they are divisors of `x`. If a divisor is found, it appends both the divisor and the quotient to the respective lists, ensuring that the final list is in the required order.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program checks two conditions for each test case:
     1. If \((n + x - 2)\) is even, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the returned divisors.
     2. If \((n - x)\) is even, it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the returned divisors.
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, it checks if \((s + 2)\) is even and if \((s + 2) / 2\) is greater than or equal to `x`. If both conditions are satisfied, the value \((s + 2) / 2\) is added to the `output` list.
   - Finally, the program removes duplicates from the `output` list using `set()` and prints the length of the resulting list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(k = 1\) is explicitly excluded since the settling does not exist for \(k = 1\).
   - The program also ensures that the values of `k` are natural numbers and satisfy the given constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values for each test case based on the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
