Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sep`**: The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`. However, the logic inside the loop where `sep` is being used to check conditions is flawed. Specifically, the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` might not correctly identify valid `k` values because it doesn't consider the periodic nature of the settling pattern.

2. **Redundant and Incorrect Logic**: The logic for checking if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is incorrect. It should instead check if the position `x` falls within the valid range of the current divisor `s`.

3. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` returns the divisors of `x`, but the logic to filter valid `k` values from these divisors is incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the properties of the settling pattern. Specifically, we need to find the divisors of `n - x + 1` and check which of them are even and greater than or equal to `x`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    # Find all divisors of (n - x + 1)
    for d in range(2, n - x + 2):
        if (n - x + 1) % d == 0 and d % 2 == 0 and d >= x:
            output.append(d)
    print(len(output))
```

This corrected version directly finds the divisors of `n - x + 1`, checks if they are even and greater than or equal to `x`, and counts them.
