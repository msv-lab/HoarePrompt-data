Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `output1` is a list containing 1, `output2` is a list containing the integer value of `x / 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` (which is 2) to `output2`. Since `x` is an integer, `x / 2` results in an integer value when using the `int()` function. The output state includes all the original conditions and updates `output2` to include the new value.
