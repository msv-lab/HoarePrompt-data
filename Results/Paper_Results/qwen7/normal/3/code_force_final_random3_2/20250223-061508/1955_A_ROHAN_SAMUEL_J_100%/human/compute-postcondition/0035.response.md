Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values of the integers entered by the user during the input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it returns the quotient of the division without any remainder.
2. `n // 2` will result in the integer division of `n` by 2.
3. This result is then multiplied by `b`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, we know that `n` and `b` are integers provided by the user.

Therefore, the output will be the integer division of `n` by 2, multiplied by `b`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b**
