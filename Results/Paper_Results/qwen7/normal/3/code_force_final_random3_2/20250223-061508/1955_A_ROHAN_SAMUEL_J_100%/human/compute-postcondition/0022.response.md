Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input split.

The `print(a * n)` statement will print the product of `a` and `n`.

Since `n` and `a` are the first and second integer inputs respectively, we need to express their values in terms of the inputs. Let's denote the first integer input as `input1` and the second integer input as `input2`. Therefore, `n = input1` and `a = input2`.

Output: **input2 * input1**
