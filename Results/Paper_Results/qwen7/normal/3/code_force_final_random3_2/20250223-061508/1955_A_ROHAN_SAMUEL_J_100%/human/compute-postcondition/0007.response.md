Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an odd integer.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- \(2 \times a \geq b\).

The expression to be evaluated and printed is `n // 2 * b + a`.

Let's break it down:

1. `n` is an odd integer. When you perform integer division (`//`) of an odd number by 2, the result is the largest integer less than or equal to half of `n`.
2. `b` is the third integer input.
3. `a` is the second integer input.
4. The expression `n // 2 * b` calculates half of `n` (integer division), and then multiplies it by `b`.
5. Finally, this result is added to `a`.

Given these details, the exact value of `n // 2 * b + a` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, we can describe the components of the expression clearly.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n is an odd integer, a is the second integer input, and b is the third integer input)**
