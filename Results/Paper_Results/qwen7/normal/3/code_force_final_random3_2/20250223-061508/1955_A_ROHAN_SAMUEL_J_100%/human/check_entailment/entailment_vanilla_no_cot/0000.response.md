Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has an issue with handling the case when `n` is even. Specifically, the logic for even `n` does not correctly account for the possibility of buying yogurts in pairs to minimize cost. The program incorrectly assumes that if `n` is even, the minimum cost is always `n // 2 * b`. However, this is not necessarily true because the cost of buying individual yogurts at price `a` might be cheaper than the promotion price `b`.

To fix this, we need to consider both the scenario where we buy all yogurts individually and the scenario where we buy them in pairs using the promotion. We should take the minimum of these two scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate cost if buying all yogurts individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Calculate cost if buying in pairs using promotion
        cost_promotion = (n // 2) * b
        if n % 2 != 0:
            cost_promotion += a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_promotion))
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering both the individual purchase and the promotion-based purchase options.
