Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input. If `n` is odd and 2 * `a` is less than `b`, then `b` remains unchanged. If `n` is odd and 2 * `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to twice the value of `a`. If `n` is even and 2 * `a` is less than `b`, then `b` remains unchanged. If `n` is even and 2 * `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to twice the value of `a`.
