Output: **a * n (where a is the second integer input and n is the first integer input, both of which are even and within the specified range)**
  
Explanation: 
- `n` is the first integer input and it is specified to be even.
- `a` is the second integer input and it is also even.
- The print statement `print(a * n)` multiplies `a` by `n` and prints the result.
- Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, the output is described in terms of these variables.
