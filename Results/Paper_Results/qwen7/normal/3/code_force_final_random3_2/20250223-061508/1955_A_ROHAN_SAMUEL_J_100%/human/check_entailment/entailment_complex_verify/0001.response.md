### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

#### Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2`):
- The program checks if `n` is odd.
  - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`, meaning buying individual yogurts is cheaper.
  - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`, meaning buying pairs at the promotional price and the remaining one individually.

#### Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`):
- The program checks if `n` is even.
  - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`, meaning buying individual yogurts is cheaper.
  - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b`, meaning buying all pairs at the promotional price.

#### Test Cases Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Output: `9`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is even, `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`. So, buy two yogurts at the promotional price: `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Output: `14`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`. So, buy two yogurts at the promotional price and one individually: `2 * b + a = 18 + 5 - 9 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Output: `15`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`. So, buy three yogurts individually: `3 * a = 15`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Output: `20`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is even, `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`. So, buy four yogurts individually: `4 * a = 20`.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Odd `n`:**
   - The logic checks if `2 * a < b` before deciding whether to buy individual yogurts or pairs at the promotional price. This ensures the minimum cost is calculated correctly.
   - If `2 * a < b`, buying individual yogurts is cheaper, and the program correctly prints `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, buying pairs at the promotional price is cheaper, and the program correctly prints `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Even `n`:**
   - The logic checks if `2 * a < b` before deciding whether to buy individual yogurts or pairs at the promotional price. This ensures the minimum cost is calculated correctly.
   - If `2 * a < b`, buying individual yogurts is cheaper, and the program correctly prints `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, buying pairs at the promotional price is cheaper, and the program correctly prints `n // 2 * b`.

#### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both odd and even numbers of yogurts and compares the costs accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
