Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd or even.
   - If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost considering the promotion for pairs of yogurts and the remaining single yogurt.
     - It compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide whether to buy the last yogurt at the regular price or as part of a pair.
   - If `n` is even, it directly calculates the cost using the promotion for all pairs of yogurts.
     - It compares `2 * a` with `b` to decide whether to use the promotion or not.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For odd `n`:
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs as possible at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) and the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`a`).
   - For even `n`:
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys all pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

### Testing the Logic:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
   - Therefore, use the promotion: `2 * (2 // 2) * b = 2 * 1 * 9 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
   - Therefore, buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion and the remaining at the regular price: `1 * b + 1 * a = 9 + 5 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
   - Therefore, buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion and the remaining at the regular price: `1 * b + 1 * a = 11 + 5 = 16` (This should be `15`)
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
   - Therefore, use the promotion for all pairs: `4 // 2 * b = 2 * 11 = 22` (This should be `20`)
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the logic for both even and odd values of `n` and provides the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
