### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step by step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2`):**
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and the remaining one individually.
       - The number of pairs is `n // 2`.
       - The remaining yogurt is `n % 2`.
       - Total cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`):**
   - If `n` is even, the program directly checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost by buying all pairs at the promotional price.
       - The number of pairs is `n // 2`.
       - Total cost is `n // 2 * b`.

### Test Cases Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Output: `9`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is even, `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`. So, buy two yogurts at the promotional price: `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Output: `14`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`. So, buy two yogurts at the promotional price and one individually: `2 * b + a = 18 + 5 - 9 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Output: `15`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`. So, buy three yogurts individually: `3 * a = 15`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Output: `20`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is even, `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`. So, buy four yogurts individually: `4 * a = 20`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both odd and even numbers of yogurts and compares the costs accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
