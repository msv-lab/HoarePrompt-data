Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `a`, and `b` are the first, second, and third integer inputs respectively, and these values are updated to the integers entered by the user during the input. Whether the condition `2 * a < b` is met or not, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
