Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values of the integers entered by the user during the input.

The `print(a * n)` statement will print the product of `a` and `n`.

Since `n` and `a` are updated to the values of the integers entered by the user, we cannot determine their exact values without knowing the specific inputs. However, we know that `a * n` will be computed using these values.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are the values entered by the user)**
