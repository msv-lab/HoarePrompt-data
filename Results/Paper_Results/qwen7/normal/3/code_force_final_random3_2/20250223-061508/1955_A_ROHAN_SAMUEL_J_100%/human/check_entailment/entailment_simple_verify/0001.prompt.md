You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are the integers entered by the user during the input. The values of n, a, and b are updated according to the conditions inside the loop, but after all iterations, they retain the final values determined by the last input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2`):**
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and the remaining one individually.
       - The number of pairs is `n // 2`.
       - The remaining yogurt is `n % 2`.
       - Total cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`):**
   - If `n` is even, the program directly checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost by buying all pairs at the promotional price.
       - The number of pairs is `n // 2`.
       - Total cost is `n // 2 * b`.

### Test Cases Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Output: `9`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is even, `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`. So, buy two yogurts at the promotional price: `9`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Output: `14`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`. So, buy two yogurts at the promotional price and one individually: `2 * b + a = 18 + 5 - 9 = 14`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Output: `15`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`. So, buy three yogurts individually: `3 * a = 15`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Output: `20`
   - Explanation: Since `n` is even, `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`. So, buy four yogurts individually: `4 * a = 20`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both odd and even numbers of yogurts and compares the costs accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
