Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are the integers entered by the user during the input. The values of n, a, and b are updated according to the conditions inside the loop, but after all iterations, they retain the final values determined by the last input.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the same as the last set of values entered by the user through the input, as each iteration updates these values based on the given conditions. The variable `t` will still be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and will represent the number of test cases, but it does not change within a single test case.
