Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. If `k` is equal to the length of the list `primes`, then 1 is yielded. Otherwise, `factor` is the next element in `rest` after `prime`, `prime_to_i` is `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `rest` remains unchanged, and the loop has executed all its iterations.**
