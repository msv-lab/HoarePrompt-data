Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    ans = 1

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. The function `generate` is assumed to be a generator function that yields all possible combinations of the prime factors of n.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `factors` is now {'2': 1, '3': 1, '4': 3}, `nn` is 0, `n` is equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is greater than `nn`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `nn` will be reduced to 0 because it keeps getting divided by its factors until it can no longer be divided (i.e., when `nn % i == 0` no longer holds true for any `i`). The variable `factors` will contain the prime factorization of `n`, and `i` will be greater than `nn` since the loop continues as long as `i * i <= nn`. Given that the loop stops when `nn` becomes 0, `i` will be incremented beyond the point where further division is possible, making `i > nn`.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: `factors` contains the prime factorization of `n`, `nn` is 1, `n` is equal to the original value of `n`, and `i` is greater than `nn`.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: Output State: The loop continues yielding factors from the `generate(0)` function until it can no longer produce any more factors. At this point, `factor` will hold the last value yielded by `generate(0)`, indicating that there are no further factors to process. 
    #
    #In this final state, `primes` will contain all the prime factors of `n`, `nn` will be equal to the product of all these prime factors (i.e., `n`), and `i` will still be greater than `nn`. However, since the loop has completed, `factor` will no longer be yielded and will hold the last factor processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer \( n \) within the range of 1 to \( 10^9 \) and returns all possible combinations of its prime factors using a generator function `generate`. It first computes the prime factorization of \( n \) and stores it in the dictionary `factors`. Then, it yields each prime factor from the `generate` function until no more factors are produced. The final state of the program includes a list of prime factors in `primes`, with `nn` set to 1 (as it is the product of all prime factors), and `i` being greater than `nn`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: Output State: `factor` is the next element in `rest` after `prime`, `prime_to_i` is `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `rest` remains as it was initially, and the loop has executed all its iterations.
        #
        #In this final state, `factor` will be set to the next element in the `rest` list after `prime`. The variable `prime_to_i` will be updated to the value of `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1` after the loop completes all its iterations. The `rest` list remains unchanged throughout the process. The loop has executed exactly `factors[prime] + 1` times, which is the total number of iterations required based on the given conditions.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. If `k` is equal to the length of the list `primes`, then 1 is yielded. Otherwise, `factor` is the next element in `rest` after `prime`, `prime_to_i` is `prime
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate(k)` accepts an integer `k` and returns a sequence of values. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, it yields `1`. Otherwise, it generates a series of factors by iterating through the remaining elements of the `rest` generator and updating `prime_to_i` to be the power of the current prime number. The function ultimately yields these factors based on the specified conditions.
