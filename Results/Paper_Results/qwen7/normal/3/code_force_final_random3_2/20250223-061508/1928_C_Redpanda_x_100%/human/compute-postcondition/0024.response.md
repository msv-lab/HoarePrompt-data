Output State: **`prime_to_i` is `factor * prime_to_i`, `rest` is a non-empty list excluding its first element, `factor` is undefined, `factors[prime]` is at least 1**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. After yielding, the value of `prime_to_i` gets updated to `factor * prime_to_i`. The first element of the list `rest` is removed since it has been processed. The variable `factor` is no longer needed as it has been used in the calculation and yielded, and `factors[prime]` remains at least 1.
