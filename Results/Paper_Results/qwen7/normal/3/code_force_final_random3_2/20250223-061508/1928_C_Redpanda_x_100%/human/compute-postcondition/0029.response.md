Output State: `factor` is `prime`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime * prime_to_i`, `rest` remains as it was initially, and `factors[prime]` is 2.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `factor` will be set to `prime`, `prime_to_i` will be updated to `prime * prime * prime_to_i`, `rest` will stay the same as it was initially, and `factors[prime]` will be confirmed to be exactly 2.
