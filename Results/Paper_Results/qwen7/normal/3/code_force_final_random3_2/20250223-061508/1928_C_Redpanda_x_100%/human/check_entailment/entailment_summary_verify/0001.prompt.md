You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `generate(k)` accepts an integer `k` and returns a sequence of values. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, it yields `1`. Otherwise, it generates a series of factors by iterating through the remaining elements of the `rest` generator and updating `prime_to_i` to be the power of the current prime number. The function ultimately yields these factors based on the specified conditions.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find how many values of \( k \) satisfy the conditions given the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must fit into the repeating pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and within one cycle, the numbers are distributed in a specific way.

3. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1` and `generate` are defined but not used in the main logic of solving the problem.
   - These functions seem to deal with prime factorization and generating factors, which are not directly relevant to solving the current problem.

4. **Relevant Logic**:
   - The core logic needed is to determine the possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the repeating pattern.
   - We need to check if \( n \) and \( x \) can be part of the sequence generated by the settling pattern.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided functions do not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem.
   - The problem requires understanding the periodicity and distribution of numbers in the settling pattern, which is not addressed by the given functions.

### Conclusion

The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly. The functions `func_1` and `generate` are not used in the context of solving the problem and do not provide the required functionality.
