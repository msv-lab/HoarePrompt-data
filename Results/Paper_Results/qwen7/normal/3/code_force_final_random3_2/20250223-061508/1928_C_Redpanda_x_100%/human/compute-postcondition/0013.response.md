Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop in question is:
   ```python
   for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The loop variable here is an underscore (`_`), indicating that the loop variable itself is not used within the loop body. However, the loop still depends on the value of `factors[prime]`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `factors[prime]` is greater than or equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop decrements the value of `factors[prime]` by 1.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime`
   - `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded

4. **Adjusting the States**: Since the loop condition depends on `factors[prime]`, we need to ensure that `factors[prime]` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time. After each iteration, `factors[prime]` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if `factors[prime]` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k-1` at the start of the next iteration, provided `k > 0`.

5. **Updating the States**: Given that `factors[prime]` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time, we update the state accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime`, `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded, `factors[prime]` must be at least 1**
