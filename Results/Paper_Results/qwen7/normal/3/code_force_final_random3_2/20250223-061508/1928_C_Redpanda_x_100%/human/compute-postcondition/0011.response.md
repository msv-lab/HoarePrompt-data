Output State: **`prime_to_i` is multiplied by `prime`; `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. This operation does not change the values of `prime_to_i` or `factor`, but it does produce the value `factor * prime_to_i` as the output. The precondition that `factors[prime] + 1` must be greater than the current counter value remains unchanged.
