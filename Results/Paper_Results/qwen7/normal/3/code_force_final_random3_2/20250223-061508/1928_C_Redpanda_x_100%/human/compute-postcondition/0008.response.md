Output State: **`factors[prime]` must be greater than or equal to 0; `factor * prime_to_i` is generated and yielded.**

Explanation: The code uses the `yield` keyword, which means it generates a value (in this case, `factor * prime_to_i`) and returns it, but does not exit the function. The value `factor * prime_to_i` is generated from the current values of `factors[prime]` and `prime_to_i`. However, since the exact values of `factors[prime]` and `prime_to_i` are not provided, we keep the condition that `factors[prime]` must be greater than or equal to 0 and note that `factor * prime_to_i` is generated and yielded.
