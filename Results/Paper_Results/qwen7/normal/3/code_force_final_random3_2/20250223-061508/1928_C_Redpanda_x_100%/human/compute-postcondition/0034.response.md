Output State: **`factor` is the next element in `rest` after `prime`, `prime_to_i` is 2, `rest` remains as it was initially, and the function yields `factor * 1`.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` updates the value of `prime_to_i` to 2 (as per the precondition) and yields the product of `factor` and `prime_to_i`. Since `prime_to_i` was 1 before and is now 2, the yielded value is `factor * 1`, which simplifies to `factor`. The other variables remain unchanged.
