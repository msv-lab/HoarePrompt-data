Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input data for each test case.**
