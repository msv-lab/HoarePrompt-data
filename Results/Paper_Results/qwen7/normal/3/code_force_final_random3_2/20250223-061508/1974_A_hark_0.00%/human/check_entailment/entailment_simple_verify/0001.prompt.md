You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of the two input values.
   - It is not used in the main logic, so we can ignore this function for now.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - It calculates the number of screens needed based on the number of `1x1` and `2x2` icons.
   - Here’s a breakdown of the logic:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`, representing the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons.
       - `x` is adjusted by subtracting `15 * bxsfory` (since each `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, and there are 3 columns, so 15 cells per row) plus `4 * y`.
       - `bxsfory1` is calculated as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15 plus 1.
       - The total number of screens is `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0:
       - The number of screens needed is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0:
       - The number of screens needed is the ceiling of `x / 15`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - The number of screens needed is 0.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2`.

### Testing the Logic

Let's test the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1: `1 1`
- `x = 1`, `y = 1`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 1 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 1 = -10` (This should be adjusted to 1 - 4 = -3, but since we can't have negative icons, it should be 1)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(1 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct, should be 1)

#### Example 2: `7 2`
- `x = 7`, `y = 2`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 7 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 2 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(0 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct, should be 1)

#### Example 3: `12 4`
- `x = 12`, `y = 4`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`
- `x = 12 - 15 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2` (Should be 12 - 20 + 16 = 8)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(8 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 2 = 3` (Correct, should be 2)

#### Example 4: `0 3`
- `x = 0`, `y = 3`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
- Total screens = `2` (Correct)

#### Example 5: `1 0`
- `x = 1`, `y = 0`
- `bxsfory = 0`
- `x = 1`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(1 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1` (Correct)

#### Example 6: `8 1`
- `x = 8`, `y = 1`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 8 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 1 = 8 - 15 + 4 = -3` (Should be 8 - 4 = 4)
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(4 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct, should be 1)

#### Example 7: `0 0`
- `x = 0`, `y = 0`
- Total screens = `0` (Correct)

#### Example 8: `2 0`
- `x = 2`, `y = 0`
- `bxsfory = 0`
- `x = 2`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(2 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1` (Correct)

#### Example 9: `15 0`
- `x = 15`, `y = 0`
- `bxsfory = 0`
- `x = 15`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(15 / 15) + 1 = 2`
- Total screens = `2` (Correct)

#### Example 10: `8 2`
- `x = 8`, `y = 2`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
- `x = 8 - 15 * 1 + 4 * 2 = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1`
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(1 / 15) + 1 = 1`
- Total screens = `1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

#### Example 11: `0 9`
- `x = 0`, `y = 9`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(9 / 2) = 5`
- Total screens = `5` (Correct)

### Conclusion

After testing the logic with the provided examples, we can see that the function does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed for some cases. Specifically, the adjustments for `x` and `y` are incorrect, leading to wrong results.
