Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller value between 'a' and 'b', where 'a' represents the number of 1x1 icons and 'b' represents the number of 2x2 icons.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It returns the smaller of the two values. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of applications with 1x1 and 2x2 icon sizes, respectively.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: 2 + ceiling(y / 2)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: At least one of `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and `x` is not equal to 0 or `y` is not greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is not greater than 0 or `y` is equal to 0.
        #State: At least one of `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `y` is unchanged and remains greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` is not greater than 0 or `y` is equal to 0.
    #State: `x` and `y` are integers. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, and `x` is greater than `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4 where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, then `y` is set to twice its value. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `y` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from input, representing the number of applications with 1x1 and 2x2 icon sizes, respectively. It then calculates and prints the total number of applications based on specific conditions. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it adjusts `x` based on `y` and calculates the total. If only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2. If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling value of `x` divided by 15. If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, x and y are integers representing the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, respectively.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: t must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, where `x` represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. The function processes this input data for each test case without returning any value.
