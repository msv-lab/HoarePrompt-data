Functionality: **The function reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from input, representing the number of applications with 1x1 and 2x2 icon sizes, respectively. It then calculates and prints the total number of applications based on specific conditions. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it adjusts `x` based on `y` and calculates the total. If only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2. If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling value of `x` divided by 15. If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.**
