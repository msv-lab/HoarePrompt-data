You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of applications with 1x1 and 2x2 icon sizes, respectively.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: 2 + ceiling(y / 2)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: At least one of `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and `x` is not equal to 0 or `y` is not greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is not greater than 0 or `y` is equal to 0.
        #State: At least one of `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `y` is unchanged and remains greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` is not greater than 0 or `y` is equal to 0.
    #State: `x` and `y` are integers. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, and `x` is greater than `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4 where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, then `y` is set to twice its value. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `y` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns the total number of applications (sum of 1x1 and 2x2 icon sizes).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
