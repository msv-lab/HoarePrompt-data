Output State: **`mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` and `h` must satisfy `l < h`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged because they depend on the current value of `mid`, which is being updated now. The conditions and constraints involving `l` and `h` also remain valid.
