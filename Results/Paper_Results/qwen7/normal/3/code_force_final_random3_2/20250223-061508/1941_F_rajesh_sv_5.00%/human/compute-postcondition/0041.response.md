Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Variables in the Loop Head
The loop head is `while l < h:`. The variables involved in this condition are `l` and `h`.

### Step 2: Determine the Initial Values
- `h` is given as `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
- `l` is given as the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`.

### Step 3: Analyze the Condition `l < h`
For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l < h` must be true.

### Step 4: Consider the Possible Adjustments
- We cannot directly change the values of `D`, `right`, `f`, `left`, or `F` because they are not part of the loop head.
- We can only adjust `l` and `h`.

### Step 5: Ensure `l < h` is True
To ensure `l < h` is true, we need to make sure that `l` is less than `h`.

Given:
- `h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`
- `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`

For `l < h` to be true, `l` must be less than `h`. Since `h` is calculated as `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, we need to ensure that `l` is less than this value.

### Step 6: Formulate the New State
Since we cannot directly change the values of `D`, `right`, `f`, `left`, or `F`, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` based on the given definitions.

Thus, the state right before the loop should be:

State: **`h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`**
