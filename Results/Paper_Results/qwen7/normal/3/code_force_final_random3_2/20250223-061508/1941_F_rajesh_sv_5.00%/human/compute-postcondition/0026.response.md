Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far.
   - `next_max_diff` is either the second largest difference or remains unchanged.
   - `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains `None`.
   - `i` is 4.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 5.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains as it was at the start of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 5.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop has not yet executed to update these values.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is either the second largest difference or remains unchanged, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains None, `i` is 5**.
