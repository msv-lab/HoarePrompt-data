Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`. This calculation does not change the values of `h`, `l`, or `mid_next_sum` and `mid_sum` which are not directly involved in this calculation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The updated value of `mid` is used in the next iteration or condition check, but its current value is as calculated.
