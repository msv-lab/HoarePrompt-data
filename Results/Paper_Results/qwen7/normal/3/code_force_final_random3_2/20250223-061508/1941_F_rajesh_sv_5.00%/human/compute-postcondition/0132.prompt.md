Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found across all elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found or remains unchanged, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains `None`, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` is `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is the final index calculated based on the condition inside the loop, `h` is the final value determined by the loop's termination condition, and `l` is the final index which is the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the minimum value it has been updated to throughout the entire loop execution, determined by the expression `min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))`. `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, and `l` and `h` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is the minimum value found during the loop, `mid_sum` is `D[l] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + 1] + f`, and `l` (which is equal to `h`) is the midpoint where the optimal solution was determined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
