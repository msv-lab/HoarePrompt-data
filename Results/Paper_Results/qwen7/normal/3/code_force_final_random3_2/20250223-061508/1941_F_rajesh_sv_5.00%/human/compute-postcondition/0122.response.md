Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `l` is less than `h`**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to be `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. The values of `mid`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial state.
