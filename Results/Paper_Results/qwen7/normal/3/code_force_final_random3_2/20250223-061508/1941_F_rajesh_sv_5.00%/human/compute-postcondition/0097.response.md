Postcondition: **`ans` is the minimum value it has been updated to throughout the entire loop execution, determined by the expression `min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` with `mid` being the last calculated midpoint during the loop's final iteration. `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f` with `mid` again being the last calculated midpoint. `l` is the final value it takes after the loop ends, which is the result of the last comparison inside the loop. `h` is the final value it takes after the loop ends, which is either the last `mid` value or the previous value of `h`. The condition `l == h` is true.**
