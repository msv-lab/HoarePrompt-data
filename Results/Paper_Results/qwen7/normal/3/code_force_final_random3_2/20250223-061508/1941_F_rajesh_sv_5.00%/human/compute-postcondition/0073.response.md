Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index such that all elements in the list `D` up to index `l` are less than or equal to `left - f`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` and `h` must be at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` using the formula `mid = l + (h - l) // 2`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, `h`, or their relationships. Therefore, these variables retain their previous conditions. The new value of `mid` is calculated based on the given formula.
