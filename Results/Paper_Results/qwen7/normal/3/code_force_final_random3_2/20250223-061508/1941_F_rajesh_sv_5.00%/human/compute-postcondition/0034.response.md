Output State: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found across all iterations, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found across all iterations, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains `None` if no differences were found, `i` is `n-1`, and `diff` is `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`.

In this final state, `max_diff` will hold the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `A`, `next_max_diff` will hold the second largest such difference, and `index` will hold the index where `max_diff` occurs. If no differences are found, `max_diff` will remain `-inf`, `next_max_diff` will remain `-inf`, and `index` will remain `None`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` after the loop completes, and `diff` will be the difference between the last two elements of the list `A`.
