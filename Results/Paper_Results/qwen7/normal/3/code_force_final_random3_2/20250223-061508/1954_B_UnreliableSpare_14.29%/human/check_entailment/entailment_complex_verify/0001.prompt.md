You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Postcondition: `flag` remains `False`, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and the loop has executed for all values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]` for any `i`, the loop breaks out of the iteration early due to the `break` statement.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: All elements of `arr` have been iterated over, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of val in arr plus one for any segment that does not start with val)
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`, and `cnt` is updated to be the new value of `ans`. This holds whether the `flag` is true or false.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It checks if the list \( a \) is monotonically the same (i.e., all elements are identical). If the list is not monotonically the same, it finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list, excluding the first element of the segment. The function then prints either \(-1\) if the list is monotonically the same or the calculated minimum count otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if it can be made into an array of all identical elements by repeatedly applying a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The array is initially beautiful, meaning it can be reduced to a single value by the given operation.
   - We need to find the minimum number of removals to break this property.
   - If the array already consists of all identical elements, no removals are needed, and the answer is -1.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same).
     - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty property.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - It checks if the array is uniform using a simple loop.
   - If the array is not uniform, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive non-uniform segments.
   - This logic ensures that the minimum number of removals is calculated correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the uniform array case correctly by printing `-1`.
   - It also correctly identifies non-uniform arrays and calculates the minimum removals.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement provided.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
