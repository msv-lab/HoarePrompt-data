Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `flag` is False, `i` is equal to `n`, and the loop has executed for all values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The loop broke out of the iteration when it found any two consecutive elements in `arr` that were not equal, setting `flag` to `False` and stopping further iterations.
