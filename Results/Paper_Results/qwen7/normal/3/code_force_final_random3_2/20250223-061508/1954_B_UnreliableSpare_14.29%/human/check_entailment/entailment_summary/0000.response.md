Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies whether the array is monotonically the same (all elements are identical).
2. If the array is monotonically the same, the program correctly outputs \(-1\).
3. For non-monotonically the same arrays, the program iterates through the array to find the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element, excluding the first element of the segment.
4. This approach ensures that the program calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition of the array.
5. The logic for finding the minimum count of consecutive occurrences seems to be implemented correctly, ensuring that the program identifies the smallest segment where removing elements would make the array no longer beautiful.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
