Output State: **Postcondition: `flag` remains `False`, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and the loop has executed for all values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]` for any `i`, the loop breaks out of the iteration early due to the `break` statement.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the flag remains `False`, indicating that there was at least one instance where `arr[i]` was not equal to `arr[i - 1]`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has checked every index from 1 to `n-1`. The value of `n` must be greater than 4 since the loop iterates at least three times as given in the conditions. The list `arr` remains unchanged and is a list of integers derived from the input. The loop breaks early if it finds any two consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal.
