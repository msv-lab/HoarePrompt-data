### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example given.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
- A beautiful array allows us to make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` processes a set of test cases.
- It checks if the array is monotonically the same (all elements are identical).
- If the array is not monotonically the same, it finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list, excluding the first element of the segment.
- The function then prints either \(-1\) if the list is monotonically the same or the calculated minimum count otherwise.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This part reads the input correctly.

2. **Checking if Array is Monotonically the Same:**
   ```python
   flag = True
   for i in range(1, n):
       if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
           flag = False
           break
   ```
   This loop checks if the array is monotonically the same. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.

3. **Finding Minimum Count of Consecutive Occurrences:**
   ```python
   ans = Decimal('Infinity')
   (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
   for i in range(n):
       if arr[i] == val:
           cnt += 1
       else:
           ans = min(ans, cnt)
   ans = min(ans, cnt)
   ```
   This loop iterates through the array to find the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element, excluding the first element of the segment.

4. **Output:**
   ```python
   if flag:
       print(-1)
   else:
       print(ans)
   ```
   If the array is monotonically the same, it prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it prints the minimum count found.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies when the array is monotonically the same and prints \(-1\) in such cases.
- For arrays that are not monotonically the same, the program calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. This is done by finding the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element, which aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Example Verification:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
- The array is not monotonically the same.
- The minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element (excluding the first element of the segment) is 1 (for the sequence "2 1" or "1 2").
- The program correctly outputs `1`.

Given the analysis, the program behaves as expected and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly handles the problem requirements and produces the expected results.
