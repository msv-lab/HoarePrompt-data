Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The initial state includes `t` being an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` being an integer between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` being a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`. The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input provided by the user, but the exact value of `n` is not specified here. The precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) remains unchanged.
