Output State: **All elements of `arr` have been iterated over, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` for each iteration until it reaches the length of `arr`. The variable `ans` will hold the minimum value between its initial value (set to Decimal('Infinity')) and the count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` plus one for any segment that does not start with `val`. This is because every time `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt + 1`, and `cnt` is reset to 0 when `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is incremented.
