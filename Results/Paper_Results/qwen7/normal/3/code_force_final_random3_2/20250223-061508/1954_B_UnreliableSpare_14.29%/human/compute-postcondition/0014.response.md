Postcondition: `flag` remains False, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `arr[i - 1]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`.
