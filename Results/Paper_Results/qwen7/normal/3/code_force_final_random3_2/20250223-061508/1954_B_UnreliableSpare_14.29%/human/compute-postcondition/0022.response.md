Output State: **Postcondition: `flag` remains `False`, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and the loop has executed for all values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans` is set to Decimal('Infinity').**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`. This does not affect the values of `flag`, `i`, `n`, or `arr`. The loop condition and its behavior (breaking out early if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`) also remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains all the conditions specified in the initial state, with only `ans` being explicitly set to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
