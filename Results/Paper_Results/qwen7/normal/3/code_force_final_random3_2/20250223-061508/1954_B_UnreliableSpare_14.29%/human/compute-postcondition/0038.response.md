Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr` and is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the smaller of its current value and `cnt`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
