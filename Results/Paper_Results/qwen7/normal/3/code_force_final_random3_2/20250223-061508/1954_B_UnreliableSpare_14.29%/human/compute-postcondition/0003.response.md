State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `flag` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, n)`.
   - `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop.
   - The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Determine Initial Values**:
   - `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n` initially.

3. **Adjust States**:
   - Since `i` is set to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues while `i < n`).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `flag` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted unless they affect the loop's execution indirectly, which is not the case here.

Thus, the required adjustments are to ensure `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.
