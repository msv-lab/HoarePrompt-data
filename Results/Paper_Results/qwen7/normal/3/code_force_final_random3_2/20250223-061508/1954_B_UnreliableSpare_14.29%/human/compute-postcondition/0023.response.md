Output State: **`flag` remains False, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is set to Decimal('Infinity').**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `val` and `cnt`. `val` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `arr`, and `cnt` is initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
