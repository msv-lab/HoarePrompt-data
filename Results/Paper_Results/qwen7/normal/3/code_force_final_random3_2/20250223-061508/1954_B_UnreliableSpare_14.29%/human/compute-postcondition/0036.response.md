Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr`.
   - `i` is increased by `1` at the end of each iteration.

4. **Postcondition analysis**:
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt` + 1.
   - `cnt` is increased by `1` regardless of whether `arr[i]` is equal to `val` or not.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the range.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans` and `cnt` are not directly adjusted here but their values will change inside the loop body based on the conditions given.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`i` is an index within the bounds of the list `arr` and is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.
