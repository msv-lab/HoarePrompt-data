Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` minus 1.
   - `i` is incremented by either 1 or 2.
   - `n_cases` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2 ** power)
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of `power`:
- `power` is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` minus 1.
- This means if `n` is a positive integer, `power` will be `floor(log2(n)) - 1`.

The expression `2 ** power` will then be `2` raised to the power of `floor(log2(n)) - 1`.

To understand this better, let's consider an example:
- If `n = 8`, then `log2(8) = 3`, so `power = floor(3) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. Therefore, `2 ** power = 2 ** 1 = 2`.
- If `n = 7`, then `log2(7) â‰ˆ 2.807`, so `power = floor(2.807) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. Therefore, `2 ** power = 2 ** 1 = 2`.

In general, for any positive integer `n`, `2 ** power` will be `2 ** (floor(log2(n)) - 1)`.

Thus, the print statement will output `2 ** (floor(log2(n)) - 1)`.

Output: **2 ** (floor(log2(n)) - 1)**
