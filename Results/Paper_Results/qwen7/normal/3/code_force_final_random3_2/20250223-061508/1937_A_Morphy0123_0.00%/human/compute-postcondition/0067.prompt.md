You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: All cases have been processed, and the loop has executed exactly `n_cases` times. For each case, if the input `n` is 1, the output is 1. If `n` is greater than 32768, the output is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is between 16384 and 32768, the output is 16384. If `n` is between 8192 and 16383, the output is 8192. If `n` is between 4096 and 8191, the output is 4096. If `n` is between 2048 and 4095, the output is 2048. If `n` is between 1024 and 2047, the output is 1024. If `n` is between 512 and 1023, the output is 512. If `n` is between 256 and 511, the output is 256. If `n` is between 128 and 255, the output is 128. If `n` is between 64 and 127, the output is 64. If `n` is between 32 and 63, the output is 32. If `n` is between 16 and 31, the output is 16. If `n` is between 8 and 15, the output is 8. If `n` is between 4 and 7, the output is 4. If `n` is between 2 and 3, the output is 2. If `n` is 1, the output is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes two integers t and n, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It does not return any value directly but seems to perform some operations or checks involving these integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
