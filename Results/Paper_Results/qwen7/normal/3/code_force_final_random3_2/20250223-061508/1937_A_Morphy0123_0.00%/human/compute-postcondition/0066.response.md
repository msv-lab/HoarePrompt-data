Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two integers t and n, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It does not return any value directly but seems to perform some operations or checks involving these integers.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific operation details in the provided output cases, the function likely processes these integers in some way, possibly involving loops or conditional checks based on their values. However, without more specific details on the operations, the exact functionality cannot be fully described beyond these constraints.
