Output State: **`n_cases` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `n_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After executing the code, `t` remains unchanged, and `n_cases` is assigned the value of the input integer, which satisfies the condition \(1 \leq n_cases \leq 10^4\). The variable `n` is not yet defined or assigned a value, so it remains unaffected.
