Based on the initial state provided:

- `power` is explicitly given as 14.
- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), but this variable is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is 2 if it was 1 or `i + 1` if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15. Since `power` is currently 14, which is one less than 15, `i` would be 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 16384, but this variable is also not used in the print statement.

The print statement `print(2 ** power)` will print \(2^{14}\).

Calculating \(2^{14}\):

\[2^{14} = 16384\]

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **16384**
