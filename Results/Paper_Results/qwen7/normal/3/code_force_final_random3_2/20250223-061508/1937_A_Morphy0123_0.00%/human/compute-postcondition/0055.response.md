Output State: The value of `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. The variable `i` will be incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on the initial value of `i`, and `n_cases` will remain unchanged as it was part of the initial state and not affected by the loop.

To break it down further:
- `power` will be set to the ceiling of `log2(n)`, meaning it will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`.
- `i` will be incremented by either 1 or 2, based on the condition inside the loop, but its exact final value isn't specified in the problem statement.
- `n_cases` will remain the same as it was initially, since it is not modified within the loop.
