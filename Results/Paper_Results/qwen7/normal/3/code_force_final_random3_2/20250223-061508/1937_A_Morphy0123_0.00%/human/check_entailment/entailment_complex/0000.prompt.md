Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

# Annotated Program:
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: All cases have been processed, and the loop has executed exactly `n_cases` times. For each case, if the input `n` is 1, the output is 1. If `n` is greater than 32768, the output is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is between 16384 and 32768, the output is 16384. If `n` is between 8192 and 16383, the output is 8192. If `n` is between 4096 and 8191, the output is 4096. If `n` is between 2048 and 4095, the output is 2048. If `n` is between 1024 and 2047, the output is 1024. If `n` is between 512 and 1023, the output is 512. If `n` is between 256 and 511, the output is 256. If `n` is between 128 and 255, the output is 128. If `n` is between 64 and 127, the output is 64. If `n` is between 32 and 63, the output is 32. If `n` is between 16 and 31, the output is 16. If `n` is between 8 and 15, the output is 8. If `n` is between 4 and 7, the output is 4. If `n` is between 2 and 3, the output is 2. If `n` is 1, the output is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it determines and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( n \). If \( n \) is 1, it simply prints 1. The function reads the number of test cases from the input first, then iterates through each case, performing the necessary calculations and printing the result.
