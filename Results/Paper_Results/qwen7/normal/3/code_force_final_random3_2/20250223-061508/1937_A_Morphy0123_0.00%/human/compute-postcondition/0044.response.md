The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n_cases` and `i` is not directly affected by this line of code, and the value of `power` remains unchanged unless `n` is specifically 1 or greater than or equal to 16384.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `i` is either `i + 1` (if it was 2) or `i + 2` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `power` is either equal to `n` if `n` is 1, or `power` is 15 and `n` is greater than or equal to 16384.

After executing the code, the value of `n` is updated to the integer input by the user, while the other variables remain in their initial states unless `n` specifically triggers changes to `power`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is either `i + 1` (if it was 2) or `i + 2` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), `n` is the integer input by the user, and `power` is either equal to `n` if `n` is 1, or `power` is 15 and `n` is greater than or equal to 16384.**
