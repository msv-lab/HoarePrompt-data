Output State: **`power` is 14, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), and `n` is greater than or equal to 16384.**

Explanation: The value of `power` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 15 to 14. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
