Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it determines and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( n \). If \( n \) is 1, it simply prints 1. The function reads the number of test cases from the input first, then iterates through each case, performing the necessary calculations and printing the result.**
