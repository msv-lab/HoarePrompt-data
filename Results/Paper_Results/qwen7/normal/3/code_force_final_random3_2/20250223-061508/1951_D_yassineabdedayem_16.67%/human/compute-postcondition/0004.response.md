Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in the input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in the input; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `number` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `rep` remain unchanged from their initial states.
