Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must not be 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and either `number` is equal to `Min` and `k` is `k - Max`, or `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`; `tab` is a list that now contains the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and `k` (after the subtraction) remain unchanged from the initial state. The new information is that `tab` now includes the string representation of `number`.
