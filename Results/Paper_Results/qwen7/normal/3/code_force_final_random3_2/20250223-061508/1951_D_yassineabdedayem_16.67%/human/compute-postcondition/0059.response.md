The only variables in the loop head are `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable) and `t`. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the state, we only need to consider `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, the loop will execute `t` times.

Given that the loop has already executed one iteration, `t` must now be `t - 1` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `t` must be \(t - 1\).

The other variables (`rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop iteration count directly.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\), `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is either 0 or greater than 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` after each iteration, which will have 60 elements.**
