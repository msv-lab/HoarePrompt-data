Based on the initial state provided, `tab` is a list that must have at least one element. However, the value of `i` is not explicitly mentioned or defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not provided and no default value is set, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Given this information, the print statement will output `i` followed by a space, but the specific value of `i` remains unknown.

Output: **i (where i is an integer, at least 0, since lists are zero-indexed and tab has at least one element)**
