Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it determines whether n can be reduced to 0 by repeatedly subtracting multiples of k from n, while keeping track of the operations performed. If n can be reduced to 0, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of operations and the sequence of operations. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function returns no direct output but modifies the standard output based on the given inputs.**
