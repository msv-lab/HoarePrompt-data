Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Min` or `k - Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list that now contains the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts `Min * Max` from `n`. The values of `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, and `k` is adjusted to either `k - Min` or `k - Max` based on the initial conditions of `number` being equal to `Min` or `Max`.
