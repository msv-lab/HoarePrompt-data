Postcondition: **`rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is a non-positive integer, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration. The condition `k != 0` holds true.**
