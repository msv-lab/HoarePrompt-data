Output State: **`rep` is 2, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `Min` and `Max`, and `number` is appended to `tab`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Since `tab` was initially a list containing the string representations of `Min` and `Max`, after appending `number`, `tab` now contains three elements: the string representation of `Min`, the string representation of `Max`, and the string representation of `number`. All other variables (`rep`, `Min`, `Max`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
