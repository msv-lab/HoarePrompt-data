Output State: **`n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` accordingly, `number` is `min(n // k, k) - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` reduces the value of `n` by `Min * Max`. The values of `k`, `Max`, `Min`, and `number` are adjusted according to their definitions, and `tab` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
