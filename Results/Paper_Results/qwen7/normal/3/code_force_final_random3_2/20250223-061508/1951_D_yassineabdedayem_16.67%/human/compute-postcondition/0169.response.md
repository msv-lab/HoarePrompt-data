Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tab`. The variables involved here are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be the next element in the list `tab`. This means that `tab` must still have at least one element left.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `tab` is a list that must have at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in the list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `tab`, after the current iteration, `i` will be set to the next element in `tab`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `tab` must still have at least one element left.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these adjustments.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tab` is a list that must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the next element in the list**.
