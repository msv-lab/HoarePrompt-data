Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted based on the condition of the if statement, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated accordingly, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the if condition, and `tab` is a list containing the string representation of either `Min` or `Max`, and `tab` now includes the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `Min * Max` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
