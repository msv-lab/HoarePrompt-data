Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer, it inherently satisfies this condition.

4. **Adjusting the State**: The initial state of `t` is given as a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0, which it already is.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself, ensuring it is a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)**.
