Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated based on the condition, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the condition, `tab` is a list containing `str(number)`, and `n - Min * Max` must be greater than or equal to `k` and `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `Min` and `Max` by calculating the minimum of `n // k` and `k` for `Min`, and the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` for `Max`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
