Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted based on the condition of the if statement, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated accordingly, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the if condition, and `tab` is a list containing the string representation of either `Min` or `Max`, and `tab` now includes the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. Depending on the if statement's condition, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`. After appending, `tab` contains the string representation of `number`. All other variables (`rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
