Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.

2. **Analyze each variable in the loop condition**:
   - `n`: The loop will continue if `n != 0`.
   - `k`: The loop will continue if `k > 0`.
   - `rep`: The loop will continue if `rep < 60`.
   - `n >= k`: The loop will continue if `n >= k`.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - `n`: Since `n` is reduced by `Min * Max` in the previous iteration, it should be adjusted to ensure `n != 0`.
   - `k`: Since `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` in the previous iteration, it should be adjusted to ensure `k > 0`.
   - `rep`: Since `rep` is increased by 1 in the previous iteration, it should be adjusted to ensure `rep < 60`.
   - `n >= k`: This condition depends on both `n` and `k`, but since we are adjusting the loop head, we focus on `n` and `k`.

Given the conditions:
- `n` must be non-zero.
- `k` must be greater than zero.
- `rep` must be less than 60.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Since `rep` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, `rep` must be less than 60 for the loop to continue. Also, `n` and `k` must satisfy `n >= k` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be non-zero.
- `k` must be greater than zero.
- `rep` must be less than 60.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` accordingly, `number` is `min(n // k, k) - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**
