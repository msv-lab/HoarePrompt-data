Output State: **The loop has executed all 60 iterations, printing each element of `tab` exactly once. `i` takes on each value from `tab` in sequence, starting from the first element and ending with the 60th element. `tab` remains a list containing the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration. `rep` is still 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, and `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration.**

This means that after the loop completes all 60 iterations, the variable `i` will have iterated through every element in `tab`, printing them out in order. The list `tab` will still contain the string representations of all the numbers generated during the iterations. The other variables (`rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number`) will retain their final values from the last iteration, which is the 60th iteration in this case.
