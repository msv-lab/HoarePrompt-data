Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `tab`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `rep` is 60
   - `n` is 0
   - `k` is 0
   - `Min` is 0
   - `Max` is 0
   - `number` is 0
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` after each iteration, which will have 60 elements

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over `tab`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been the last element of `tab`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must still contain elements.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be the first element of `tab` for the next iteration.
   - `tab` should have at least one element remaining for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` with at least one element remaining**. 

Since `i` will be the first element of `tab` for the next iteration, we don't need to specify `i` explicitly in the state update. The focus is on ensuring `tab` has at least one element remaining.

So, the final state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` with at least one element remaining**.
