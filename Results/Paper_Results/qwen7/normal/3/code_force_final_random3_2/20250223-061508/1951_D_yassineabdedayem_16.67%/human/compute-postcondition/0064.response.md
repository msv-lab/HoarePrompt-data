Let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop and determine which states need to be adjusted:

1. `n != 0`: This condition checks if `n` is not zero.
2. `k > 0`: This condition checks if `k` is greater than zero.
3. `rep < 60`: This condition checks if `rep` is less than 60.
4. `n >= k`: This condition checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the initial states:
- `rep` is 0
- `n` is an integer read from the standard input
- `k` is either 0 or greater than 0
- `Min` is 0
- `Max` is 0
- `number` is 0
- `tab` is an empty list

We need to ensure that all conditions in the `while` loop are satisfied for the first iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `n != 0`**: 
   - `n` is an integer read from the standard input. We need to ensure that `n` is not zero.
   
2. **Condition `k > 0`**:
   - `k` is either 0 or greater than 0. We need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.
   
3. **Condition `rep < 60`**:
   - `rep` is 0. Since `rep` is already 0, this condition is automatically satisfied.
   
4. **Condition `n >= k`**:
   - `n` is an integer read from the standard input, and `k` is either 0 or greater than 0. We need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Adjusted States:

- `n` must be a non-zero integer.
- `k` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `k`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list**
