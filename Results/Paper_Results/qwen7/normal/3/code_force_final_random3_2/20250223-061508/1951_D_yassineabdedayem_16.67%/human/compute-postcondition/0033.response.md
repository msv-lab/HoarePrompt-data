Output State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` accordingly, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `Min` and `Max` based on the conditions given. Specifically, `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. Given the conditions, `number` is set to `Max`. The values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, and the constraints remain unchanged from the initial state.
