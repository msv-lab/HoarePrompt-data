Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
```

For the loop to continue executing, all conditions must be true:
1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `rep` is 1
- `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`
- `k` is a positive integer
- `Min` is defined as `min(n // (k - min(n // k, k)), k - min(n // k, k))`
- `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / (k - min(n // k, k))), k - min(n // k, k))`
- `number` is defined as `max(int(n / (k - min(n // k, k))), k - min(n // k, k))`
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Condition `n != 0`:**
   - Since `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, and `Min` and `Max` are derived from `n`, `n` cannot be zero at this point. This condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition `k > 0`:**
   - `k` is explicitly stated as a positive integer, so this condition is already satisfied.

3. **Condition `rep < 60`:**
   - `rep` is currently 1, which is less than 60. This condition is already satisfied.

4. **Condition `n >= k`:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is still greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to continue. Since `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, and `Min` and `Max` are derived from `n`, we need to ensure that `n` remains non-negative and sufficiently large compared to `k`.

### Adjusting the State
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to maintain the following:
- `n` should remain a non-zero integer - `Min * Max` and should be greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` should remain a positive integer.
- `rep` should remain less than 60.

Since `n` is derived from `Min` and `Max`, and these values depend on `n` itself, we need to ensure that `n` is adjusted such that `n >= k` holds true. However, since `n` is already a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, and `Min` and `Max` are derived from `n`, we don't need to change `n` directly. Instead, we need to ensure that `k` and `rep` are adjusted appropriately.

Given that `rep` is already 1 and less than 60, and `k` is a positive integer, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `n` remains valid.

### Final State
State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `min(n // (k - min(n // k, k)), k - min(n // k, k))`, `Max` is `max(int(n / (k - min(n // k, k))), k - min(n // k, k))`, `number` is `max(int(n / (k - min(n // k, k))), k - min(n // k, k))`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
