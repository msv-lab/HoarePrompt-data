Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `n // k`, `Max` is `int(n / k)`, `number` is `int(n / k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `int(n / k)`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `Min` is calculated as `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is calculated as `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- After executing `Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)`, the values of `Min` and `Max` are updated directly from these expressions.
- The values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the assignment operation.
