Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted based on the condition of the if statement, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated accordingly, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the if condition, and `tab` is a list containing the string representation of either `Min` or `Max`, and `tab` now includes the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The line `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. Initially, `rep` was 1, so after executing this line, `rep` becomes 2. The values of `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged from their initial state because the code only modifies `rep`.
