Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `Min` is 0.
- `Max` is 0.
- `number` is 0.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` with at least one element remaining.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since no value is assigned to `i` in the provided code snippet, it implies that `i` is not initialized or updated anywhere in the given context.

Given this information, the output will be undefined because `i` is not explicitly set to any value.

Output: **undefined**
