Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion of hours correctly for times between 13:00 and 23:59. Specifically, it fails to convert hours greater than 12 correctly to the 12-hour format. For example, the input `23:45` should be converted to `11:45 PM`, but the program incorrectly prints `11:45 AM`. This is evident from the hardcoded conditions for each hour, which do not account for the full range of 13 to 23. A more efficient and correct approach would be to use the modulo operation to handle this conversion, such as `h1 = str((int(h) - 12) % 12 + 1)` for hours greater than 12, and set `time = 'PM'` if `int(h) >= 12`.
