Output State: **`h1` is '03', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':', `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, and the original state of `time` being an empty string are not altered by this assignment. Therefore, `h1` remains `'03'`, `m1` remains equal to `m`, `h` and `m` remain as the input values split by `':'`, and `time` is now set to `'PM'`.
