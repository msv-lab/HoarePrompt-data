Output State: **`h1` is '07', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is an input value, `m` is an input value, `time` is 'AM'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `time` was an empty string, but now it is set to `'AM'`.
