Output State: **`h` is a string containing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string containing the minute part of the input**.

This means that the code has taken an input in the format of `hour:minute` (separated by a colon), split it into two parts, and stored the hour part in the variable `h` and the minute part in the variable `m`, both as strings.
