#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute as many times as the integer input provided by the user. After all iterations, the output state will be as follows:
    #
    #- `h1` will be the 12-hour format representation of the hour part of the last input time, with 'AM' or 'PM' appended based on whether the hour is before or after noon.
    #- `m1` will be equal to the minute part of the last input time.
    #- `time` will be 'AM' if the hour part of the last input time is '01', '02', '03', or '04', and 'PM' otherwise.
    #
    #In summary, the final output will reflect the 12-hour format of the last processed time along with its minutes and AM/PM indicator.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple time inputs in the 24-hour format and converts them into the 12-hour format with AM/PM indicators. It prints out each converted time and updates the variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` to reflect the last processed time in the 12-hour format. After processing all inputs, the final state includes `h1` as the 12-hour formatted hour, `m1` as the minute part, and `time` as either 'AM' or 'PM'.
