Output State: **`h1` is '02', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, `h` is not equal to '01', and the current value of `h` is '02'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'02'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `m1`, `time`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
