Output State: **`h1` is '08', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is '08'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'08'` to the variable `h1`. The value of `h` changes from `'08'` to `'08'`, meaning it remains `'08'`. The values of `m1` and `time` remain unchanged as they were initially set to `m` and an empty string, respectively.
