Output State: **`h1` is '07', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is a string containing the hour part of the input, `time` is 'PM'**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. This does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, or `h`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is that `time` is now explicitly set to `'PM'`.
