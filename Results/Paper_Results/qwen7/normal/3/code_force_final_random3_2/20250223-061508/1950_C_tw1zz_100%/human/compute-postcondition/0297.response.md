Output State: **`h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is a string containing the hour part of the input, `time` is an empty string**.

The code initializes the variable `time` as an empty string, but does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, or `h`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
