Output State: **`h1` is '02', `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` and `m` are updated to the input values split by ':', `time` is 'PM'**.

In this case, the code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. Since the initial state of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, and `time` is already given, and no other operations are performed on these variables, their values remain unchanged. The only new information is that `time` is now set to `'PM'`.
