Output State: **`h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is '22'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'10'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `m1`, `time`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `m1` is still equal to `m`, `time` remains an empty string, and `h` is still '22'.
