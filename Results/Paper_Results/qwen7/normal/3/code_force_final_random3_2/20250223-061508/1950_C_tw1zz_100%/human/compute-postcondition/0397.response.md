Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

However, since the function signature does not include parameters `t` and `s`, and the problem description specifies these should be part of the function's input, let's correct the function signature accordingly:

```python
def func(t, s):
```
