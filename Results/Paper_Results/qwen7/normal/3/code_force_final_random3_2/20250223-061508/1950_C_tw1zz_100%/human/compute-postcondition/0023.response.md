Output State: **`h1` is '04', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM', and `h` is not equal to '03'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. This updates the value of `time`, but does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, or `h`. Therefore, the updated state includes `time` being set to `'AM'`, while the other variables retain their original values.
