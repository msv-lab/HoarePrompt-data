Postcondition: `i` is 2, `not_c` is False, `A` is True, and if the element at index `i` in `set_` minus the element at index `i-1` in `set_` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the same values of `i`, `not_c`, `A`, and `set_` are retained.
