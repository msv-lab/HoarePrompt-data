### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case one by one.
   - It reads the number of piles (`n`) and the initial number of stones in each pile (`arr`).
   - The `func_1` function is called with `arr` as its argument.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function first converts `arr` into a set and then sorts it to get `set_`.
   - If the smallest element in `set_` is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice', indicating Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, the function enters a loop that iterates through the sorted unique elements of `arr`.
   - In this loop:
     - If the difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than 1, the loop breaks, setting `not_c` to `False`.
     - The boolean `A` alternates between `True` and `False` with each iteration.
   - After the loop, if `not_c` is still `True`, `A` is toggled again.
   - Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to determine the winner based on the properties of the sorted unique elements of `arr`.
   - The key points are:
     - If the smallest element is not 1, Alice wins immediately.
     - If the differences between consecutive elements are always 1, the game essentially reduces to a Nim game where the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner.
     - The alternating boolean `A` helps in determining the winner based on the number of iterations and the properties of the sorted unique elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the smallest element is not 1 or where the differences between consecutive elements are not always 1.
   - The logic correctly identifies the winner based on the given rules.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
