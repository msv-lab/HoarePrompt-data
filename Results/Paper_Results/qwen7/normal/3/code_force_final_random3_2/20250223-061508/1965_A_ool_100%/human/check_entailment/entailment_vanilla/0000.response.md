Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes the array `arr` as input.
   - It converts the array to a set and sorts it to get unique values in ascending order.
   - It checks if the smallest value in the sorted set is 1. If not, it returns "Alice".
   - It then iterates through the sorted set to check if the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1. If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False`.
   - It alternates the boolean variable `A` based on the length of the sorted set.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Smallest Value:**
   - The logic correctly identifies that if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can immediately win by removing 1 stone from each pile, making all piles have 0 stones. Hence, returning "Alice" is correct.

2. **Checking Differences Between Piles:**
   - The logic correctly identifies that if the differences between consecutive pile sizes are all 1, the game reduces to a Nim game where the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner. Specifically, if the XOR of all pile sizes is 0, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
   - However, the current implementation does not correctly compute the XOR of the pile sizes. Instead, it checks if the differences between consecutive elements are 1, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in the Nim game.

3. **Alternating Boolean Variable:**
   - The alternating boolean variable `A` is used to simulate the XOR operation but does not correctly represent the Nim game strategy. The XOR operation should be applied to the pile sizes directly.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the Nim game strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
