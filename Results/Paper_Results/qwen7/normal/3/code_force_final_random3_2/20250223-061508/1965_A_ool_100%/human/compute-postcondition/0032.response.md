Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is False.**

Explanation: The if statement checks if `not_c` is True. If `not_c` is True, the postcondition remains as `i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is True. Since there is no else part, the only case considered is when `not_c` is True, which results in `i` being set to 4, `not_c` remaining False, and `A` becoming True. However, the final postcondition provided in the problem statement indicates that after the loop completes, `A` is False. This suggests that the loop's logic or the subsequent code outside this if statement sets `A` to False. Therefore, the overall postcondition after the if else block executes is that `i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is False.
