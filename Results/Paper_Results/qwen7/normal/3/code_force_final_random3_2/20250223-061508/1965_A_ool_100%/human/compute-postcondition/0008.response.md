Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, len(set_))`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(set_))`.
   - This means `i` must be an integer starting from 1 up to but not including `len(set_)`.

3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `not_c` is True.
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - `set_` is a list of unique integers from `arr` sorted in ascending order.
   - `A` is False.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 1` and continue until `i < len(set_)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `len(set_)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - `i` must be 1.
   - `len(set_)` must be at least 1.

Given these points, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `len(set_)` must be at least 1**
