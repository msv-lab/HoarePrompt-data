You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, `set_` is a list of unique integers from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `A` is False, and the first element of `set_` is 1
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is False.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop iterates based on the length of `set_`, and the output state after 3 iterations shows `i` as 3, it means `set_` has at least 4 elements (since the loop starts from 1). The loop checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1. If it finds such a pair, it breaks the loop and sets `not_c` to False. After 3 iterations, `not_c` is False, and `A` alternates between True and False, ending up as False after an odd number of iterations. Since there are no further conditions provided that would change these values and the loop would continue until `i` reaches the length of `set_`, `i` will be set to 4 upon completion of all iterations, maintaining `not_c` as False and `A` as False.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `i` is 4, `not_c` is False, and `A` is False.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Bob'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It returns 'Alice' if Alice wins according to the game rules, and 'Bob' if Bob wins.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Bob'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
