Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `not_c` is True, `arr` is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, `set_` is a list of unique integers from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `A` is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
    if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
        not_c = False
        break
    A = not A


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `not_c` is False, and `A` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `not_c` is False, `A` is False, and if the element at index `i` in `set_` minus the element at index `i-1` in `set_` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the same values of `i`, `not_c`, `A`, and `set_` are retained.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `not_c` is False, `A` is True, and if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] <= 1`, the same conditions hold without any change.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
