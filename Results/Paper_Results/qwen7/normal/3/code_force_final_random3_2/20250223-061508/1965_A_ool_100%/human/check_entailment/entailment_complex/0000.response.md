Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a list `arr` representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It first checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, it immediately returns 'Alice', indicating that Alice can win by removing one stone from each pile.
   - Next, it creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` and iterates through this list to check the differences between consecutive elements.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it toggles the boolean `A`.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' otherwise.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to determine the winner based on the properties of the piles:
     - If the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice can always win by removing one stone from each pile.
     - For the remaining cases, the function uses a toggle mechanism to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of valid moves (where the difference between consecutive piles is exactly 1).
   - The toggle mechanism ensures that if the number of valid moves is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided example test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases like single-element lists and large numbers.
   - The function handles these cases correctly according to the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program logic is sound and correctly implements the rules of the game.
   - The function `func_1` accurately determines the winner based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
