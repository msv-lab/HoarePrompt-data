Output State: `results` is now a list containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after running the loop through all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` holds the highest sum of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop for each `x`, `best_y` is the `y` value that produced this maximum sum for each `x`, `x` takes on each value from `test_cases` one by one, `y` is 1 (since it starts from `x-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, and the loop has finished executing for all values in `test_cases`.

In simpler terms, `results` will contain the optimal `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after the loop has run through all iterations, where the optimal `y` is the one that maximizes the sum of the GCD of `x` and `y` plus `y`.
