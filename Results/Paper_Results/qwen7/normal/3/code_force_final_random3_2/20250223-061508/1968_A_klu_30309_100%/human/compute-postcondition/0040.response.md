Output State: **`max_sum` is now 2 + `y`, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
