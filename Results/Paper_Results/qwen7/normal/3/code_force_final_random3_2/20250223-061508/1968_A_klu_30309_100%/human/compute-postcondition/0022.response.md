Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` remains the same, `y` is `y - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y - 2`**.

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to `gcd_val + y - 2`. Here, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
