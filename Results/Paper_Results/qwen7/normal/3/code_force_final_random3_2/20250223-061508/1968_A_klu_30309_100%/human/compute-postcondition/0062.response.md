Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `x` is 1 less than the length of `test_cases`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is 1, and `results` now contains 1.**

Explanation: The line `best_y = 1` directly assigns the value 1 to the variable `best_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
