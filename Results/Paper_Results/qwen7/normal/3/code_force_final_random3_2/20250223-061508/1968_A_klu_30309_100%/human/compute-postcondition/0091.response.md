Output State: `results` is now a list containing the values `[1, 1, 1]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is 3, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, and `best_y` is 1 after the loop has executed all iterations.

This means that for each `x` in `test_cases`, the loop has determined that the value of `y` which maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is 1, and the maximum sum found was 3. The loop has iterated through all elements in `test_cases`, and `results` now contains the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`.
