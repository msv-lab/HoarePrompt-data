Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 3, `best_y` is 2**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `gcd_val` is calculated as `math.gcd(x, 1)`, which is 1 since the GCD of any number and 1 is 1.
- The code updates `current_sum` to `gcd_val + y`. Given `y` is 1 and `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
- The precondition that `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum` remains true, so `max_sum` is also 3.
- The value of `x` must be at least 2, and `y` was initially 1 but is updated to 2 due to the calculation.
- `best_y` remains 2 as no change was made to it in the given code snippet.
- `gcd_val` remains 1 as no change was made to it in the given code snippet.
