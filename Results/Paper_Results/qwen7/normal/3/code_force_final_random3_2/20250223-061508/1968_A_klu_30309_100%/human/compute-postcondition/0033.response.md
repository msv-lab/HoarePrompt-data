Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `y` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x - 1` down to `1` (since `0` is excluded). The loop condition is defined by the range function: `range(x - 1, 0, -1)`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `y`**: Initially, `y` is set to the value of `x`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `y` is such that the loop can start executing. Since the loop starts from `x - 1` and goes down to `1`, `x` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Initial Values**: Given that `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, and `y` starts as `x`, we need to ensure that `x > 1` for the loop to start.

6. **Final Adjusted State**: The initial values of `max_sum`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head. `best_y` remains `1` because it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `x` must be greater than 1.
- `y` starts as `x`.

**State: **`max_sum` remains 0, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x`, `gcd_val` remains 1, `current_sum` remains 2, `best_y` is 1**
