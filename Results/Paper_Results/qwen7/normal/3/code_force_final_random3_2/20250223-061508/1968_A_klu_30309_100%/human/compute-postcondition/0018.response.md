The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the only effect is that the program would exit the current context (if it was inside a loop or switch). However, since no such context is present, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` is the same, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
