Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the provided code snippet, the initial conditions remain unchanged except for indicating that the loop or conditional statement has been exited.
