Output State: **`max_sum` remains 0, `x` must be greater than 2, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, `gcd_val` is recalculated as the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`**

Explanation: The code updates `gcd_val` to be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. Since `y` is already defined as `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is recalculated but its value remains the same as before the assignment. All other variables retain their previous values.
