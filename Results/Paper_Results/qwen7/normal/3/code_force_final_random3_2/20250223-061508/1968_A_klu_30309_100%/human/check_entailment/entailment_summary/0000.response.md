Reasoning:
The provided execution summary states that for each input \( x \), the function `func_1` incorrectly determines that the value of \( y \) which maximizes the sum of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is always 1, resulting in a maximum sum of 3. However, this is not generally true for all inputs as per the problem statement.

Let's consider the problem again:

- We need to find \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
- The execution summary suggests that the function always returns \( y = 1 \), but this is not necessarily the optimal choice for every \( x \).

To verify correctness, let's look at some specific examples:

1. For \( x = 10 \):
   - If \( y = 5 \), then \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
   - If \( y = 1 \), then \( \gcd(10, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - Clearly, \( y = 5 \) gives a higher sum than \( y = 1 \).

2. For \( x = 21 \):
   - If \( y = 18 \), then \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21 \).
   - If \( y = 1 \), then \( \gcd(21, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - Again, \( y = 18 \) gives a higher sum than \( y = 1 \).

From these examples, it is clear that the function does not correctly identify the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Instead, it always returns \( y = 1 \), which is not necessarily the optimal choice.

Given the execution summary and the examples, the function is incorrect because it does not find the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for each \( x \).

Correctness: **False**
