Output State: **max_sum remains 0, x remains the last value it was set to (which is 1 less than the length of test_cases), y is 1, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is gcd_val + y, and best_y is y.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `max_sum` will still be 0 because no `current_sum` value exceeded it during the loop's iterations. The variable `x` will be set to the last value it was updated to, which is one less than the length of `test_cases`. `y` will be 1 since the loop iterates over decreasing values of `y` starting from `x-1` down to 1. `gcd_val` will be the greatest common divisor of the final `x` and `y` (which is 1). `current_sum` will be `gcd_val + y`, and `best_y` will be the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`, which in this case is 1, as the loop breaks when `y` reaches 1.
