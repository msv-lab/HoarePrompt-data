Output State: **`max_sum` is 3, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `best_y` is 2, `current_sum` is 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `gcd_val + y` to `current_sum`. Given that `gcd_val` is 1 and `y` is 1, `current_sum` is calculated as 1 + 1, which equals 2. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
