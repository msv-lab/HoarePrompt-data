Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to the current value of `current_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
