Output State: **`max_sum` remains 0, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` remains 2, `best_y` is 1**

The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd(x, y)`. Given that `y` is equal to `x`, the GCD of `x` and `x` is `x` itself. However, since the initial value of `gcd_val` is specified as 1, it implies that `x` must be 1 (since the GCD of any number with itself is the number itself, but here it's explicitly set to 1). Therefore, `gcd_val` remains 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
