The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
