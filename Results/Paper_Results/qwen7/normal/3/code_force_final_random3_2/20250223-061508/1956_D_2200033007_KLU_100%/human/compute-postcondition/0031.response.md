Output State: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` equals `i`, the value of `i` is not equal to 0, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`; `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`**.

This means that the list `res` has been appended with the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, while the other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
