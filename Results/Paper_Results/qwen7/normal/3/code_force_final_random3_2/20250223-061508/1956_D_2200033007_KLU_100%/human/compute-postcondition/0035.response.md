Output State: **`i` must be greater than 0; `start_index` and `i` define a valid range; `j` is `start_index`; `arr[j]` is now equal to `i`**

Explanation: The code `arr[j] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the element in the array `arr` at the index `j`. Since `j` is equal to `start_index`, the value of `i` is assigned to `arr[start_index]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
