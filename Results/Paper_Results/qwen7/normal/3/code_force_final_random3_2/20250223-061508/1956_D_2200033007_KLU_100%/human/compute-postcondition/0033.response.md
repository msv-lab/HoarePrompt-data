Output State: **`i` must be greater than 0; `start_index` and `i` define a valid range; `arr[j]` is assigned the value of `i`.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `arr[j]`. Since `i` must be greater than 0 and `start_index` and `i` define a valid range, `j` must be within that range. Therefore, `arr[j]` is now equal to `i`. The conditions on `i` and the range defined by `start_index` remain unchanged.
