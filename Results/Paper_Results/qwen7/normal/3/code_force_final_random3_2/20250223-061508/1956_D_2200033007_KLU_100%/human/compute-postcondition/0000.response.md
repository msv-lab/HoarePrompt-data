Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is True**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `is_already_stairs`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= n - 1, and `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, while `is_already_stairs` is set to `True`.
