Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `arr` by performing up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations where each operation sets a contiguous subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the maximum possible sum of the array by recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays and calculating the maximum sum for each segment. It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function finds the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`. It checks various conditions and splits the array accordingly to find the optimal subarrays to set to their MEX values.
   - **Function `make_stairs`**: This function is used internally by `func_2` to form a "stair" pattern in the array. It ensures that the array segments are set to their appropriate MEX values to maximize the sum.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: The logic seems correct as it uses dynamic programming with memoization to ensure efficient computation of the maximum sum.
   - **Function `func_2`**: The logic appears to correctly identify the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum by recursively splitting the array and using the results from `func_1`.
   - **Function `make_stairs`**: This function correctly forms the "stair" pattern, ensuring that the array segments are set to their MEX values to maximize the sum.

Given the problem constraints and the logical structure of the functions, the provided solution seems to correctly implement the required functionality to maximize the sum of the array elements.

Correctness: **True**
