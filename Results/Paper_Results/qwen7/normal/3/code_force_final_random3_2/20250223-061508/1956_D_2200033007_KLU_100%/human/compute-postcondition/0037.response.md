Output State: **`i` must be greater than 0; `start_index` and `i` define a valid range; `j` is `start_index + 1`; `arr[j]` is now `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `arr[j]`. Since `j` is defined as `start_index + 1`, `arr[start_index + 1]` is now equal to `i`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
