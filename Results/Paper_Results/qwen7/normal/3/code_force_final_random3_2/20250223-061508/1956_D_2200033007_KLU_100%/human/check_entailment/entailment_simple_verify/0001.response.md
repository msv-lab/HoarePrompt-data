### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided functions, particularly focusing on their complexity, potential inefficiency, and failure to handle edge cases. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the annotated code and the problem requirements.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`.
- **Recursive Approach**: The function uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to split the subarray into smaller parts and calculate the maximum sum for each part.
- **Base Case**: When `start_index == end_index`, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element at `start_index`.
- **Recursive Case**: It splits the subarray into two parts and recursively calculates the maximum sum for each part, adding the middle element if included.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Generates the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
- **Staircase Pattern**: It constructs a staircase pattern in the array to ensure all elements are set to their optimal values.
- **Recursive Calls**: It recursively calls itself to handle different subarrays and constructs the operations needed.

#### Function `make_stairs`:
- **Purpose**: Constructs a staircase pattern in the array.
- **Logic**: It ensures that the array elements are set to their optimal values to achieve the maximum sum.

### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case and recursively splits the subarray to find the maximum sum.
   - The use of memoization (`res_dict`) helps avoid redundant calculations, making the function more efficient.
   - While the recursive approach might seem complex, it is designed to handle the problem constraints effectively.

2. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly generates the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It constructs the staircase pattern to ensure all elements are set to their optimal values.
   - The recursive calls ensure that the operations are applied optimally to achieve the desired sum.

3. **Correctness of `make_stairs`**:
   - The function correctly sets the array elements to form a staircase pattern.
   - It ensures that the array elements are set to their optimal values to achieve the maximum sum.

### Edge Cases and Performance:
- **Edge Cases**: The functions handle edge cases such as single-element arrays and arrays with all elements already set to their optimal values.
- **Performance**: The use of memoization and recursive splitting ensures that the functions are efficient and do not exceed the \(5 \times 10^5\) operation limit.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis and the annotated code, the provided functions are correct and handle the problem requirements effectively. They correctly compute the maximum sum and generate the necessary operations to achieve it.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
