Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop condition. In this case, the loop variable is `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(pans) - 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments until it reaches `len(pans)`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `1`
   - `pans` is a list of length `n`
   - `mak` is `1` if the input string is `'>'; otherwise, it remains unchanged

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1`. Therefore, `i` will become `2`.

5. **Check the List Length**: Since `i` is now `2`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`. Given that `pans` is a list of length `n`, the loop will continue as long as `2 < len(pans)`.

6. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are those in the loop head, which are `i` and `pans`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `2`
- `pans` is a list of length `n`

Since `mak` is not directly affected by the loop condition and its value remains unchanged unless the input string is `'>',` we do not need to adjust `mak` here.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `pans` is a list of length `n`**
