Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list that either contains the element `n-1` or contains `i` (which is `n-1`), `s` is the string input by the user, and if `s` is not equal to `<`, `pans` will contain an additional element `n-1` if `s` is equal to `=`.
