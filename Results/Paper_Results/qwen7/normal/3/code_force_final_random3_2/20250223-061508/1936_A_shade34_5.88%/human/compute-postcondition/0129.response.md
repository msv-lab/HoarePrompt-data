Output State: **`mak` is 1, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 1, `pans` is either `['0']` or `[0]`, `s` is the string entered by the user, `n` is the input integer from the user, `s` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `mak`. The other variables remain unchanged.
