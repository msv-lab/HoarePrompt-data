Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` must be at least 3
   - `s` is the string input by the user
   - If `s` equals '<', then `mak` is equal to `i`, and `pans` is a list containing `[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '<', and `pans` is a list containing the value `i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `pans` and `mak` remain unchanged unless `s` equals '<' in the current iteration, but since we are looking at the state before the next iteration, these values do not change.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `n`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `pans` and `mak` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is the string input by the user, `pans` and `mak` remain unchanged**. 

Given the constraints and the need to specify the exact state, we can simplify it to:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is the string input by the user**.
