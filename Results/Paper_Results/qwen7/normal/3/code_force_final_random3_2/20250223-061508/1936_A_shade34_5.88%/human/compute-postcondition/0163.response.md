Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3
- `pans` is a list of length `n`
- If the input string is '>', then `mak` is 2; otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged (and thus `mak` will be 0 since no other value is specified)

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since the input string is not specified, we assume it is not '>', so `mak` remains 0.
2. `i` is explicitly given as 3.
3. `pans` is a list of length `n`, but the specific values within the list are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `pans[0]` and `pans[3]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]]**
