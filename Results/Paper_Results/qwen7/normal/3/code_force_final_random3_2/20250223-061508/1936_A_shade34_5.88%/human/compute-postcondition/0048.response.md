Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `n-1` and `i` (which is `n-1`), `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`, and if `s` is equal to `'='`, then no changes are made to the variables; otherwise, the variables remain in their original state.
