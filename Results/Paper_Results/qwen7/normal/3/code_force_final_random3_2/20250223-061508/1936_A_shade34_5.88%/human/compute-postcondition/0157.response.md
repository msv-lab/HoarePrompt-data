Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `pans` is a list of length `n`, but the specific values within the list are not provided.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. The value of `pans[i]` would be the third element of the list `pans` (since list indices start from 0).
3. The value of `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we need to keep it as `mak`.

Given these points, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]' (where [pans[mak]] is the value of pans at index mak and [pans[i]] is the third element of the list pans)**
