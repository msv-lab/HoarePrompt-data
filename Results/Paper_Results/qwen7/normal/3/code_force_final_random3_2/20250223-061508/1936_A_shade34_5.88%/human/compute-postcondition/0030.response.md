Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the string '<'**.

Explanation: The code `mak = i` updates the value of `mak` to be the same as the current value of `i`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is also updated to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
