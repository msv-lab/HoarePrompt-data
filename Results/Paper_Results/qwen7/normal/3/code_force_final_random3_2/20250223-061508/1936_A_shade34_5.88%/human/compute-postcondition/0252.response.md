Output State: **`pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is equal to `i`, and `mak` is equal to `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `mak` was previously equal to `i + 1`. Now, the code updates `mak` to be equal to `i`. Since both expressions must be true, `mak` is now equal to `i`, and consequently, `mak` is also equal to `i + 1` (which implies `i` must be `-1` for this equality to hold). The precondition that `pans` must have at least 2 elements remains unchanged.
