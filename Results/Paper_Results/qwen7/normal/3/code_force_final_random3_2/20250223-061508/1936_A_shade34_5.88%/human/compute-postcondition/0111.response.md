Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Current States**:
   - `mak` is `n`.
   - `mak2` is `n`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - `s` is the string `'>', n`.
   - `n` is the input integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is used as the loop counter, it should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `n` should remain consistent with the input integer.

5. **Final State**:
   - `mak` is `n`.
   - `mak2` is `n`.
   - `i` is 0 (initial value for the loop).
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - `s` is the string `'>', n`.
   - `n` is the input integer.

So, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 0, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the string `'>', n`, `n` is the input integer**.
