Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is the final input string, and `pans` is a list containing the values of `i` from each iteration, starting from `n-1` down to `0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is equal to `i`, and the user has entered a string which is equal to '>', regardless of whether the condition `str(input()) == '>'` is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is equal to `i`, and if the user has entered a string which is equal to '>', the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is equal to `i`, and no changes were made to the variables due to the `sys.stdout.flush()` command. If the input string is `'>',` then `mak` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
