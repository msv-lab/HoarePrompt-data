Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is `n + 2`
- `mak2` is `n - 1`
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>'`
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed multiple times (though this does not affect the content of the print statement)

The `print` statement is `print('!', mak2, mak)`. 

Given the values:
- `mak2` is `n - 1`
- `mak` is `n + 2`

The print statement will output the string `'!'` followed by the value of `mak2` and then the value of `mak`.

Output: **! n - 1 n + 2**
