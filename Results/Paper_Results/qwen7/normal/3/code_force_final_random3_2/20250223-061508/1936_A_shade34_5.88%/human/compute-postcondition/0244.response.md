Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - The user has entered a string which is equal to '>', but this string is not used in the print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

Given the initial state:
- Since `pans` has at least 2 elements, let's denote the first element as `pans[0]` and the second element as `pans[1]`. We don't know the exact values of these elements, but we know they exist.
- `mak` is defined as `i + 1`. Since `pans` has at least 2 elements, `i` must be 0 (the index of the first element), making `mak` equal to `0 + 1 = 1`.

Therefore:
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[1]`.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[0]`.

The print statement will then print:
- `'?'`
- `pans[1]` (which is the second element of `pans`)
- `pans[1]` (repeated)
- `pans[0]` (which is the first element of `pans`)
- `pans[0]` (repeated)

Output: **'? [second_element_of_pans] [second_element_of_pans] [first_element_of_pans] [first_element_of_pans]**
