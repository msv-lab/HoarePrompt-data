Functionality: **The function interacts with an external entity to determine indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, where \(p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}\) is a permutation of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). It achieves this by making at most \(3n\) queries. After executing the function, it outputs the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize the bitwise XOR operation.**
