Output State: **`mak` is 1, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 1, `pans` is `[1]`, `s` is the string entered by the user, `n` is the input integer from the user, `s` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `pans = [i]` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pans` becomes `[1]`, while `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, `s`, and `n` retain their original values.
