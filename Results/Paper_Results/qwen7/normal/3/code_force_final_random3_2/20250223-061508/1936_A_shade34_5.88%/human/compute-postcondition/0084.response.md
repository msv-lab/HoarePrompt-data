Output State: **mak is n + 2, mak2 is n - 1, i is n + 2, pans is a list containing the elements n - 1, n - 1, n, and s is the string '>', and sys.stdout.flush() has been executed multiple times.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or add new information to the state. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
