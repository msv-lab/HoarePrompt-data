Output State: **`mak` is `n + 2`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n + 2`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, `s` is the string `'>', n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which must be greater than 0) to the variable `n`. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `pans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `s` remains as the string `'>'.` The value of `n` is now an integer obtained from user input.
