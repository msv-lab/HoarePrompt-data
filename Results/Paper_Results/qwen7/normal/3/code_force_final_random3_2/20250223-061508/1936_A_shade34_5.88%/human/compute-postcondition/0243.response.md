Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(pans))`. This means `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - The user has entered a string which is equal to '>', regardless of the condition `str(input()) == '>'`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < len(pans)`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - `pans` must still have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` will now be equal to `i + 1` because `i` is incremented by 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `pans` must still have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` will be equal to `i + 1`.
   - The user has entered a string which is equal to '>', regardless of the condition `str(input()) == '>'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is equal to `i + 1`, and the user has entered a string which is equal to '>'**.
