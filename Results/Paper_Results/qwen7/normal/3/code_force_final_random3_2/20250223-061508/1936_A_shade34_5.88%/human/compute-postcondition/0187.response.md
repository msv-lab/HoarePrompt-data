Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 3
   - `pans` is a list of length `n`
   - `mak` is 2
   - `k` is `k-2`

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be incremented to 3.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - To allow the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 3.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be at least 3.
   - The other variables (`pans`, `mak`, and `k`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `pans` is a list of length `n`, `mak` is 2, and `k` is `k-2`.**
