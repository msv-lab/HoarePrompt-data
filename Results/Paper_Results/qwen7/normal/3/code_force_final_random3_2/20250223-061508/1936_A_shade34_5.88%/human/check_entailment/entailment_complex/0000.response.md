### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the size of the permutation (`n`).
   - For each test case, it initializes variables `mak` and `mak2` to 0, and `pans` as an empty list.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR Value**:
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`. For each `i`, it makes a query to compare `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This step aims to find the index `i` where the bitwise OR of the same index is the highest.

3. **Finding Possible Candidates**:
   - The second loop iterates through all indices from 0 to `n-1` and makes queries to compare `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and stores `i` in `pans`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`.

4. **Selecting the Best Candidate**:
   - The third loop iterates through the candidates stored in `pans` and makes queries to compare `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, it prints the indices `mak2` and `mak` which are supposed to maximize the bitwise XOR operation.

### Analysis:

1. **Query Efficiency**:
   - The code makes at most \(3n\) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The logic for finding the maximum bitwise OR value is sound and ensures that the candidate indices are selected correctly.

2. **Candidate Selection**:
   - The second loop correctly identifies potential candidates for maximizing the bitwise XOR operation.
   - The third loop ensures that the best candidate is selected by comparing the bitwise OR values directly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the maximum bitwise OR might occur at the same index or when multiple indices have the same maximum value.

4. **Output**:
   - The output format is correct, and the indices are printed as required.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. The code adheres to the problem constraints and correctly processes the input and output as specified.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
