Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to `n + 2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n > 1` and `i` is within the range `[1, n-1]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 2`, it is not within the range `[1, n-1]` for any valid `n`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value within this range.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.**
