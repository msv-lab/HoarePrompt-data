Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - If the user has entered a string which is equal to '>', the state remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `pans` has at least 2 elements.
- `mak` is set to `i + 1`.

However, the values of `i` and the specific elements in `pans` are not explicitly given. Therefore, we need to express the output in terms of these variables.

Given that `mak` is `i + 1`, the expression `pans[mak]` will refer to the element at index `i + 1` in the list `pans`. Similarly, `pans[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.

So, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `pans[mak]` (the element at index `i + 1`)
- `pans[mak]` (repeated, the same element at index `i + 1`)
- `pans[i]` (the element at index `i`)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[i + 1]] [pans[i + 1]] [pans[i]]'** (where `[pans[i + 1]]` is the element at index `i + 1` and `[pans[i]]` is the element at index `i` in the list `pans`)
