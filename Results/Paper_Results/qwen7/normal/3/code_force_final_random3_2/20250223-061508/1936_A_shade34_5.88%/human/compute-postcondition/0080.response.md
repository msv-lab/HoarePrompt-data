Output State: **`mak` is equal to `i`, all other variables retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. No other changes are made to the variables or the state. Therefore, `mak` now holds the value of `i`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
