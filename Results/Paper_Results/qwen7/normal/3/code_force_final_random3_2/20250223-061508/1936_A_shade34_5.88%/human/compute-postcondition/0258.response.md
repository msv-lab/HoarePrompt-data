Output State: mak is 0, mak2 is 0, i is 0, pans is a list containing the elements from n-1 down to 0, and s is the string '>', and sys.stdout.flush() has been executed multiple times.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `mak` will be set to 0 because it starts from `n-1` and gets decremented each time a comparison results in `'>` until it reaches 0. `mak2` also ends up being 0 as it is assigned the value of `mak` at the end of the loop. The variable `i` is also 0 since it starts from `n-1` and gets decremented to 0. The list `pans` will contain the original list of values from `n-1` down to 0, as it is constructed by comparing each index with `mak2` and appending the index if the comparison results in `'='`. No further changes are made to these variables within the loop, so their final states reflect the completion of all iterations.
