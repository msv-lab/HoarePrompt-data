Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be at least 3; `pans` is a list of length `n`; `mak` is 2; `k` is `k-2`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains 2, `n` must still be at least 3, `pans` is still a list of length `n`, and `k` remains `k-2`.
