Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The input received is less than 0

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2 (because `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `mak` remains 1
- `i` becomes 2
- `n` must still be greater than 1

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
