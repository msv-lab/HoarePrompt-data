None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with an external entity to query bitwise operations on a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \), which is a permutation of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). The interaction involves making at most \(3n\) queries to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
