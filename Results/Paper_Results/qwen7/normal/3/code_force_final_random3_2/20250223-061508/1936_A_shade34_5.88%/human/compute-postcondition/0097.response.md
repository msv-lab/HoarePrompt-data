Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variable values or states. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are assigned or modified by this line of code, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
