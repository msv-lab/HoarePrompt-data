Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`.
   - `n` must be such that `1 <= n < len(pans)` and `pans` must have at least 2 elements.

2. **List `pans`:**
   - Since `pans` contains `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s`, and `n` must be within the bounds of `pans`, let's consider the possible values for `n`.
   - Given that `pans` has at least 2 elements, it must contain at least two distinct elements. Therefore, `n` can be 2, 3, or any higher value depending on the actual input for `s`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`.
   - Substituting the values from the initial state:
     - `pans[mak]` where `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`, which is `n-1`.
     - `pans[i]` where `i` is `n`, so `pans[i]` is `pans[n]`.

Given these steps, let's assume the simplest case where `n` is 2 (the minimum value that satisfies the conditions):

- `pans` would be `[1, 1, 2, s]` if `n` is 2.
- `pans[0]` (which is `pans[mak]`) is `1`.
- `pans[2]` (which is `pans[i]`) is `2`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
```
?, 1, 1, 2, 2
```

Output: **?, 1, 1, 2, 2**
