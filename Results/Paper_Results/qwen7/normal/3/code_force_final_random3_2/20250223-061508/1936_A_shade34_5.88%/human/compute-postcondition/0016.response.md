Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop, which are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mak` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - If the input string is `<`, the condition remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1, but since it was already greater than 1 and no information suggests it changes, we assume it remains greater than 1.
   - The value of `mak` and the condition related to the input string do not change based on the loop itself and remain as they were.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `mak` remains 2.
   - The condition related to the input string remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
