To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given print statement and the initial state:

Given print statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Initial state is not explicitly provided, but we need to infer the values of `pans`, `mak`, and `i` from the context of the print statement itself. The print statement references `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`, suggesting that these indices are valid and correspond to elements in the list `pans`.

Let's assume the following based on typical usage patterns:
- `pans` is a list.
- `mak` and `i` are indices into the list `pans`.

Given the print statement, it will print the string `'?'` followed by the value of `pans[mak]` twice, and then the value of `pans[i]` twice. Since the exact values of `pans`, `mak`, and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'**
