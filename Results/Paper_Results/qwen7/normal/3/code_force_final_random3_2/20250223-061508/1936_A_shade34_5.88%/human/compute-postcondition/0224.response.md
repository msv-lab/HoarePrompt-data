Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` must be at least 3. Therefore, `i` is at least 4.
- `s` is a new string input by the user. Since no specific value is given, we'll keep it as `s`.
- `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` from the previous iteration. Since this is the first iteration, `pans` would be an empty list `[]`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Here, `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, so they are undefined. However, since the question asks us to determine exactly what will be printed, and we don't have any information about `mak` and `mak2`, we can only assume they are placeholders or variables that are not initialized.

Given the lack of explicit values for `mak` and `mak2`, the output will include these variables along with the other explicitly defined values.

Output: **'? [undefined], [undefined], [i (at least 4)], [undefined]**
