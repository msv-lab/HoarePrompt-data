State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is 0 or negative.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.
