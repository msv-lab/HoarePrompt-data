Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values or conditions for these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0 and will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is already given as an input integer that must be greater than 0.

3. **Check if the loop can execute based on the initial values**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`). This condition is already given as `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - The value of `j` is initially set to 0, which is valid for the loop to start.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, the loop can start executing.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `j` being 0 and `n` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
