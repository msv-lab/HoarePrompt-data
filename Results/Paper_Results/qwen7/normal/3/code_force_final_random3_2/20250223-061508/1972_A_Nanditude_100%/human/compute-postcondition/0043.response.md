Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.
- If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `i` is increased by 1.
- The loop iterates over `j` in the range `n`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined by the variable `j` in the range `n`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted within the loop head is `j`.

### Analysis
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1 (since the loop runs from `range(n)`).
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

### Adjusting the State
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `n - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to `n`.

### Updated State
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.
- `j` must be set to `n`.

### Final Answer
State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `i` is increased by 1. `j` is **`n`**.**

This means that at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be set to `n` to ensure the loop continues executing.
