Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `i = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
