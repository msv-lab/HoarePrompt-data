Postcondition: `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.
