Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized in the `range` function.
   - `mdx`: This variable is defined outside the loop but used as the starting point for the `range` function.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - `i` is initialized in the `range(mdx, n)`, so `i` should start from `mdx` and go up to `n-1`.
   - `mdx` is defined as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. We need to ensure this value is correctly set before the loop starts.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - `t` and `t - 1` being equal and `t` being greater than 0 are not directly related to the loop execution. These conditions are likely part of some initialization logic and do not affect the loop itself.
   - `n` is an input integer and is used to define `mdx`, so it should be correctly set.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers and is not directly involved in the loop execution.
   - `res` is initialized to 0 and is not directly involved in the loop execution.
   - `mdx` must be correctly set based on the value of `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `mdx`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**
