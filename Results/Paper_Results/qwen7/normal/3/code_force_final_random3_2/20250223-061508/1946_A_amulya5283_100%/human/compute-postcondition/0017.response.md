Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `mdx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mdx` to `n-1` (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mdx` is less than `n`.
   - If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `mdx + 1` (assuming it was `mdx` at the start of the previous iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `mdx` remains the same because it is not incremented or modified within the loop.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `mdx + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`mdx` is less than `n`, and if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `i` is `mdx + 1`, and `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`**.
