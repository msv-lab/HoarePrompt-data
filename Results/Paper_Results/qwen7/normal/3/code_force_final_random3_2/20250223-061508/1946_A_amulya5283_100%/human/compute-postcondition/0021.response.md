Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mdx, n)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mdx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i = mdx` and increments `i` until `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mdx` is less than `n`.
   - If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is increased by 1, `i` is set to `mdx + 1`, and `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`.
   - If `a[mdx]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `res` remains unchanged, `i` is set to `mdx + 1`, and `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = mdx` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `mdx + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `i` is updated to `mdx + 1`.
   - `mdx` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the above steps, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `i` is `mdx + 1`.
- `mdx` remains the same.
- `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mdx` is the same as before, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`**.
