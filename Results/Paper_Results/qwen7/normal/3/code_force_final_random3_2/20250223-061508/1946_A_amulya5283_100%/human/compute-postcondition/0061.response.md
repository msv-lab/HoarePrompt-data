Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string; `res` is 0; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and the new variable `mdx` is introduced with its calculated value.
