Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string. If `n` equals 1, the values of `t`, `n`, and `mdx` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `mdx + n`, indicating the end of the list `a`. The variable `res` contains the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. The variables `n` and `mdx` retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.**
