Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the median index as `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula is not correct for finding the median index when `n` is odd. For an odd `n`, the median index should be `n // 2`.

2. **Logic for Counting Operations**: The logic for counting the number of operations to make the median larger is flawed. The current implementation counts how many elements are equal to the median, which is not relevant to the problem. Instead, it should count how many operations are needed to make the median element strictly greater than its current value.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            med_index = n // 2
            median_value = a[med_index]
            res = 0
            for i in range(med_index, n):
                if a[i] <= median_value:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
```

This corrected function properly calculates the median index and counts the number of operations needed to ensure the median increases.
