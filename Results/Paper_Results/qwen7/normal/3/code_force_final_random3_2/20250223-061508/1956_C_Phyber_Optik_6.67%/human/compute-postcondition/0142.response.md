Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is any non-negative integer.
- `j` is `j_prev + 1` where `j_prev` was less than or equal to `n + r`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n + 1` (exclusive).
2. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Since `n` is only stated to be greater than or equal to 1, but no specific value is given, the output will depend on the actual value of `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n** (where `n` is the value of `n` and the numbers from 1 to `n` are printed)
