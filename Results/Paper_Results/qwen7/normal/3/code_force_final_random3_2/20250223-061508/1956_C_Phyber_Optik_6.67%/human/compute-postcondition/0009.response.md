Output State: **`sum` is `i * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. Initially, `i` is 1, so `i * n` is `n`. After the operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The conditions `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be at least 1 remain unchanged. The value of `sum` is now `i * n`, which is `2 * n`. The value of `r` remains 0.
