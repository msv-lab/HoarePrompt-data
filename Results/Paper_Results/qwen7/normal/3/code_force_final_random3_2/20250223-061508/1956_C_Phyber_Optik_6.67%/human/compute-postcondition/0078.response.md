Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `r` is 0
- `j` is greater than `n`

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the components:

1. **2**: This is a constant value and will always be printed as is.
2. **j % n**: Since `j` is 1 and `j` is greater than `n`, it implies that `n` must be less than 1, but since `n` is an integer, the smallest possible value for `n` that satisfies this condition would be 0. However, modulo operation with 0 is undefined in Python. But considering typical constraints where `n` should be a positive integer, if `n` were 1 or more, then `1 % n` would simply be 1 because any number modulo itself is 0, and 1 modulo any larger number is 1.

Given the condition that `j` is greater than `n`, and assuming `n` is a positive integer, the expression `j % n` would evaluate to 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output `2 1`.

Output: **2 1**
