Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, and the current value of \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) is greater than \( i \times n \)**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since the initial value of `sum` is 0, after executing `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `r`) remain unchanged, and the condition involving `n` and `i` also remains valid.
