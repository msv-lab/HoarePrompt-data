Given the initial state where `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is any non-negative integer, and `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only describe the range of numbers that will be printed.

Output: **1 2 ... n** (where `n` is a number greater than or equal to 1)
