Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2), `sum` and `r` will be updated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `r` is equal to `i`**.

This means that the value of `r` has been directly assigned to `i`, while the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `sum`, and the condition itself remain unchanged from the initial state.
