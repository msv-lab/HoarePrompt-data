Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is any non-negative integer (though its value is not specified).
- `j` is `j_prev + 1` where `j_prev` was less than or equal to `n + r`.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Since `n` is only stated to be greater than or equal to 1, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1, and there is no upper bound given other than it being an integer.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is the value of n, which is at least 1)**
