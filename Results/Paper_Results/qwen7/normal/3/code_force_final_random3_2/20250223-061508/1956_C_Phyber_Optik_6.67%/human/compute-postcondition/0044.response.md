Given the initial state where `j` is defined as `n + r + 1`, and both `n` and `r` remain the same, we need to focus on the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement.

- `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.
- The `*` operator unpacks this range into separate arguments for the `print` function, effectively printing each number in the sequence on the same line separated by spaces.

Since the exact values of `n` and `r` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n** (where `n` is the value of `n` and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive)
