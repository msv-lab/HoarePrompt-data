To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation process step by step:

1. **Initialization and Loop Execution**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 after the loop.
   - `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.
   - `i` is set to `n + 1` after the loop.
   - `sum` is calculated as follows:
     - For each `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, add `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
     - For all other `i`, add `i * n` to `sum`.
   - `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.

2. **Understanding the Sum Calculation**:
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to `n + 1 > 2i`, or `i < (n + 1) / 2`.
   - Therefore, `sum` will include the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` from 1 to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` and the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n`.

3. **Calculating `sum`**:
   - The sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for `i` from 1 to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) * ((n + 1) // 2 - 1) // 2`.
   - The sum of `i * n` for `i` from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n` is `n * (sum of integers from (n + 1) // 2 to n)`.
   - The sum of integers from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n` is `((n + (n + 1) // 2) * (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1)) // 2`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - `sum` will be the sum of the above two parts.
   - `r` will be the largest `i` such that `i < (n + 1) / 2`, which is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.

Given these calculations, the final values of `sum` and `n + r` can be described as follows:

- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for `i` from 1 to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` and the sum of `i * n` for `i` from `(n + 1) // 2` to `n`.
- `n + r` is `n + ((n + 1) // 2 - 1)`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **sum, n + (n + 1) // 2 - 1 (where sum is the calculated sum and n is the value of n)**
