Output State: **The loop will continue to increment `j` until it reaches `n + r + 1`. For each iteration, if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it will print "1 j" followed by a space and then the numbers from 1 to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, it will print "2 (j % n)" followed by a space and then the numbers from 1 to `n`. The final output will consist of lines printed during each iteration of the loop, with `j` ranging from 1 to `n + r + 1`.**

This output state describes the complete set of prints generated after the loop has executed all its iterations, starting from `j = 1` up to `j = n + r + 1`.
