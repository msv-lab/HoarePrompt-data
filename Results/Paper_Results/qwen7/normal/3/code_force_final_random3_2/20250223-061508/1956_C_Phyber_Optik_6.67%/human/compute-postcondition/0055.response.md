Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `sum` is `i * n`, and \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) is less than or equal to \( i \times n \)**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` adds the value of `i * n` to the variable `sum`. Initially, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer. The condition \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) is less than or equal to \( i \times n \) remains valid since `i` has not changed and `n` is still an input integer. Therefore, `sum` is updated to `i * n`, which is `1 * n` or simply `n`.
