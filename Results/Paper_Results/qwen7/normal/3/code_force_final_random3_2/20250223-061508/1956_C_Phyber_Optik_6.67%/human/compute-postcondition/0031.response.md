Based on the initial state:

- `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- `r` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is an integer greater than `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Here's the breakdown:

1. The first argument to `print` is the integer `2`.
2. The second argument is `j % n`, which represents the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. Since `j` is greater than `n`, `j % n` will be a value between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive).

Given these conditions, the output will include the integer `2` followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.

Output: **2 [remainder of j divided by n]**
