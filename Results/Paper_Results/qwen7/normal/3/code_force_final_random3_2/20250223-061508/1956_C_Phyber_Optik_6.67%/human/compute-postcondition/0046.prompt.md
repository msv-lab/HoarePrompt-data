Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, t must be greater than 0, n must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, i will be equal to n + 1, sum will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all i where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the sum of `i * n` for all other i, and r will be equal to the largest i where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, `r` must be non-negative, and if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `r`. If `j` is greater than `n`, `r` remains non-negative as it was initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is incremented from 1 to `n + r`, and at the end of the loop, `j` is greater than `n`. The value of `r` remains non-negative but does not change further.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `n + r + 1`, `n` remains the same, `r` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
