Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `j` and the range is defined as `range(1, n + r + 1)`. This means `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + r`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `r` is any non-negative integer.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `r`.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, `r` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j + 1` must still be less than or equal to `n + r`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` remains the same since it does not change within the loop.
   - `r` remains unchanged unless `j` exceeds `n`, but since we are considering the next iteration, `j` is yet to exceed `n`, so `r` remains unchanged.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given that `j` was previously less than or equal to `n + r`, in the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`. Therefore, `j` must now be such that `j + 1` is still within the range.

Since the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote it as `j_prev`. Thus, in the next iteration, `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.

**Final State**:
- `n` remains the same.
- `r` remains the same.
- `j` will be `j_prev + 1`, where `j_prev` was less than or equal to `n + r`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is any non-negative integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1` where `j_prev` was less than or equal to `n + r`**.
