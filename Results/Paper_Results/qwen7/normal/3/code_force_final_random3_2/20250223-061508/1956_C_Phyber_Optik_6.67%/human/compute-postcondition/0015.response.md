Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2), `sum` is increased by `i * n`, `r` remains unchanged**.

This means that the variable `sum` has been updated by adding the product of `i` and `n` to its current value. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `r`) remain in their original conditions as specified in the initial state.
