Output State: **`sum` is increased by `i * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2), `r` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. The conditions for `t`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state.
