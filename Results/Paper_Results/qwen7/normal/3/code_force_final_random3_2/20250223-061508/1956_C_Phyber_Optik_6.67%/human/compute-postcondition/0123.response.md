Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, or `i * n` otherwise.**

This means that `sum` will contain the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. Otherwise, `sum` will be the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.
