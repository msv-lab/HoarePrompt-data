Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2), `sum` is increased by either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, otherwise it is increased by `i * n`, `r` is equal to `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, otherwise `r` remains unchanged.
