Given the initial state where `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is any non-negative integer, and `j` is greater than `n`, we need to determine what will be printed when the following code snippet executes:

```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. The `*` operator in front of `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print each number in the range separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we know it is at least 1. For example, if `n` were 3, the range would be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Thus, the output will be a space-separated list of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is a number greater than or equal to 1)**
