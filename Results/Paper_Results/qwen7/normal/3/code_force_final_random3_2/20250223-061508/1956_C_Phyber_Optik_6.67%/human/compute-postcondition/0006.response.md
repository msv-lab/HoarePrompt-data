Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 1, and the current value of \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) is greater than \( i \times n \)**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which was initially 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions. The precondition that \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) is greater than \( i \times n \) remains valid since no operations that could affect this condition were performed.
