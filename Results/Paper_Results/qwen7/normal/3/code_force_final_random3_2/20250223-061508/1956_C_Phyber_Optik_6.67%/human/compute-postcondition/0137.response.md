Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is any non-negative integer.
- `j` is `j_prev + 1`, where `j_prev` was less than or equal to `n + r`.

We need to determine the values that will be printed by the statement `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`.

1. The first value to be printed is `2`, which is explicitly stated in the print statement.
2. For the second value, we need to consider `j % n`. Since `j` is `j_prev + 1` and `j_prev` is less than or equal to `n + r`, it follows that `j` is also less than or equal to `n + r`. Therefore, `j % n` will give the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

Given that `j` is less than or equal to `n + r` and `n` is at least 1, the remainder when `j` is divided by `n` will be a value between 0 and `n-1` inclusive. However, without the exact value of `j`, we cannot specify a precise number, but we know it will be one of these values.

Thus, the output will be `2` followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.

Output: **2, [remainder of j divided by n]**
