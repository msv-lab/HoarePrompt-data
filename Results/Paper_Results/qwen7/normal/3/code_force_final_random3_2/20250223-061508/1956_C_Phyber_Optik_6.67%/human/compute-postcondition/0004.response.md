Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be at least 1 (since the range starts from 1).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `t` is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.
   - The variable `sum` and `r` are not part of the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0**
