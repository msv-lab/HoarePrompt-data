Given the initial state where `j` is 3 and `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Since `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 2. If `n` were any larger, the sequence would simply extend accordingly. For the sake of this explanation, we'll assume the minimum value of `n` to be 2.

Therefore, the output will be the sequence of numbers from 1 to 2, which are 1 and 2.

Output: **1 2**
