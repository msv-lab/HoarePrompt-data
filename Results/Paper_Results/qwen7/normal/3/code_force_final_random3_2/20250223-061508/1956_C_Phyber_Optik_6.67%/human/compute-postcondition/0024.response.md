Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, t must be greater than 0, n must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, i will be equal to n + 1, sum will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all i where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the sum of `i * n` for all other i, and r will be equal to the largest i where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains within the specified range (1 to 500).
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n + 1`.
- The variable `sum` will contain the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop.
- The variable `r` will hold the largest value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` during any iteration of the loop.
