Output State: **`r` is increased by `a[x]`, `s` remains the same, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, and `b[x]` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increases the value of `b[x]` by 1. Since `b[x]` was previously increased by 1 (as per the initial state), it is now increased by 2 in total. The other variables (`r`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
