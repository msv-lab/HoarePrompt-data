Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `s`. The values of `t`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
