Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial conditions for `q` and the nature of `x` and `y` as inputs remain unchanged, but now `x` and `y` hold the specific values entered by the user.
