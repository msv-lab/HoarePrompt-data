Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is determined based on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not. Once `x` is known, `b[i]` is updated to be the value of `b[i - 1]` plus `x`. The initial conditions for `a[i]` and `x` remain unchanged except for their relationship, and the new value of `b[i]` is calculated based on the previous value of `b[i - 1]` and the current value of `x`.
