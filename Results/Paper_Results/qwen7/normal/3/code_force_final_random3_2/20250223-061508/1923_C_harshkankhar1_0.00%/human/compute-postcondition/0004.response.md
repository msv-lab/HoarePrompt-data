Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1 else 2**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. Since `i` is 1, the condition checks if `a[1]` is greater than 1. If `a[1]` is greater than 1, then `x` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, `x` is assigned the value 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
