Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `x` if the condition `a[i] > 1` is true, and assigns the value 2 to `x` if the condition is false. The initial state of `x` being 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1 else 2 is directly updated based on the condition. The value of `a[i]` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
