Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`, where `i` is `current_i + 1` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `current_i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` assigns the value of `x` based on the condition of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is greater than 1, `x` is set to 1; otherwise, `x` is set to 2. The value of `b[i]` is updated according to the formula `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x`, but since the initial value of `b[i]` was not provided, it remains as `b[i - 1] + x`. The conditions and relationships between the variables `a[i]`, `x`, and `b[i]` are preserved, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `current_i + 1`.
