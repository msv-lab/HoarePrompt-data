Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n + 1`; `x` will be 1 if `a[i]` (which is `a[n + 1]`) is greater than 1, else 2; `b[i]` (which is `b[n + 1]`) will be the sum of all `x` values from `b[0]` to `b[n]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`, `x` will depend on whether `a[n + 1]` is greater than 1, and `b[n + 1]` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values calculated during each iteration of the loop.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n]]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `q` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop will run, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the output is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the condition a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `c` of `n` positive integers and handles `q` queries. For each query, it checks a range `[l_i, r_i]` within the list and returns 'YES' if the sum of elements in the range `[x, y]` is greater than or equal to the sum of `x` values in the same range, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
