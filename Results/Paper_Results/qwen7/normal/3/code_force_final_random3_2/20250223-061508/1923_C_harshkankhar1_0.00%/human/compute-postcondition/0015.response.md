Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `x` is 1 if `a[n + 1]` is greater than 1, else 2.
   - `b[n + 1]` is the sum of all `x` values from `b[0]` to `b[n]`.
   - `a` is updated to be the cumulative sum of its original values.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `i = n + 1`: This means `i` is one more than `n`.
   - `x` depends on `a[n + 1]`:
     - If `a[n + 1] > 1`, then `x = 1`.
     - Otherwise, `x = 2`.
   - `b[n + 1]` is the sum of all `x` values from `b[0]` to `b[n]`. Since `x` is either 1 or 2, `b[n + 1]` will be the sum of these values.
   - `a` is updated to be the cumulative sum of its original values. This means `a[i]` (which is `a[n + 1]`) will be the sum of all elements in `a` up to that point.

3. **Printing `*a`**:
   - The `*a` in the print statement indicates that `a` is being unpacked and printed as individual elements.
   - Given that `a` is updated to be the cumulative sum of its original values, the final `a` will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the previous elements.

Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we can only describe the final state of `a` based on the given conditions.

Output: **[a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n]]**
