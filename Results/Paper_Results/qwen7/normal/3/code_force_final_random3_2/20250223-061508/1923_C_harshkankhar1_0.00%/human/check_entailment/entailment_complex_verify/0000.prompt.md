You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n + 1`; `x` will be 1 if `a[i]` (which is `a[n + 1]`) is greater than 1, else 2; `b[i]` (which is `b[n + 1]`) will be the sum of all `x` values from `b[0]` to `b[n]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`, `x` will depend on whether `a[n + 1]` is greater than 1, and `b[n + 1]` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values calculated during each iteration of the loop.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[n]]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `q` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop will run, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the output is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the condition a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `c` of `n` positive integers and handles `q` queries. For each query, it checks a range `[l_i, r_i]` within the list and returns 'YES' if the sum of elements in the range `[x, y]` is greater than or equal to the sum of `x` values in the same range, otherwise it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program does not check whether the subarray can be transformed into another array \(b\) that satisfies the conditions of being good. Instead, it seems to be calculating prefix sums and comparing them, which is not relevant to determining if a subarray is good.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 4
  1 2 1 4 5
  1 5
  4 4
  3 4
  1 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  NO
  YES
  NO
  ```

However, the program outputs:
  ```
  1 3 4 8 13
  NO
  NO
  NO
  NO
  ```

This output is incorrect because the program does not check if the subarrays can be transformed into another array \(b\) that meets the criteria for being good. For instance, the subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` can be transformed into `[2, 2, 2, 4, 5]`, which satisfies the conditions of being good. Similarly, the subarray `[4]` cannot be transformed into another array that meets the conditions, but the program incorrectly labels it as `NO`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is good, making it incorrect.
