Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `c` of n positive integers and handles q queries. For each query, it checks a range [l_i, r_i] within the list and returns the sum of elements within that range.**

This means the function is designed to take a list of positive integers `c` and a set of queries defined by ranges `[l_i, r_i]`. It then calculates and returns the sum of the elements within each specified range for all queries.
