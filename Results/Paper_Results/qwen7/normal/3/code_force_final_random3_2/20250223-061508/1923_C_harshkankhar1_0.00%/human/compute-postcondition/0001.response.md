Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered as input.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` that starts with 0 followed by integers split from the input. The input is expected to be space-separated integers. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `q` remains an input integer. The list `a` is initialized with 0 as its first element, followed by the integers from the input.
