Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the initial counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero. Otherwise, Bob wins.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally.
3. **Calculation Logic**: The provided solution uses a formula `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3` to compute the result.

Let's analyze the formula:
- `x // 2` gives the integer division of `x` by 2.
- `x % 2` gives the remainder of `x` divided by 2.
- `(i < 3)` is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if `i` is less than 3 (i.e., for 1s, 2s, and 3s) and 0 otherwise.
- The formula `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` effectively counts the number of odd occurrences of 1s, 2s, and 3s (since 4s do not affect the XOR result).
- Summing these values and dividing by 3 gives the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Given this analysis, the provided formula does indeed correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It accurately calculates the maximum number of Bob's wins based on the initial counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
