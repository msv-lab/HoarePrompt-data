Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 1, `__name__` is `__main__`, `[n, x, y]` is a list containing three integers split from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the first `x` elements of the list `[n, x, y]` to integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` iterates over the first `x` elements of the list `[n, x, y]` and converts each element to an integer. The resulting list `arr` contains these converted integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
