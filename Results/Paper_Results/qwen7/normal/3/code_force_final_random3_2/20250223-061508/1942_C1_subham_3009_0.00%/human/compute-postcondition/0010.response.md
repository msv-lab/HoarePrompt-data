Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of the first `x` integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and splits them into `n`, `x`, and `y`. It then creates a list `arr` containing the first `x` integers from the list `[n, x, y]`. The values of `t` and `__name__` remain unchanged.
