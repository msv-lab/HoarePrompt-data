Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. Given the constraints, `y` is always 0.
3. It then reads the chosen vertices and stores them in a list `arr`.
4. The key logic in the program is `print(x - 2)`, which is intended to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.
5. For a polygon with `x` chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is indeed `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles without any intersections.

Given the problem statement and the logic implemented in the program, the program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake based on the number of chosen vertices `x`.

Correctness: **True**
