Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.**

Explanation: The code `[n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial value of `t` and the fact that `__name__` is `__main__` remain unchanged. The list `arr` is not modified by this operation, so it retains its initial state as a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.
