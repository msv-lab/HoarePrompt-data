Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t is an input integer; the current value of __name__ is '__main__'
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    print(x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer - 1, `__name__` is `__main__`, `[n, x, y]` is a list containing three integers split from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the first `x` elements of the list `[n, x, y]` to integers.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than -1, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t-1`, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
