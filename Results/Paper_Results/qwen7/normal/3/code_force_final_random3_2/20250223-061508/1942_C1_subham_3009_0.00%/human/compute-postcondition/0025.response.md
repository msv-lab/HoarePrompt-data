Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\), followed by \(x\) distinct integers from 1 to \(n\). For each test case, it prints the value \(x - 2\). After processing all test cases, it ensures that the counter \(t\) is reduced to 0. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
