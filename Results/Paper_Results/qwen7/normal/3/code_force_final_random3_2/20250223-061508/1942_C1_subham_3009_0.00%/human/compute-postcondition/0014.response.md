The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than -1. Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index**
