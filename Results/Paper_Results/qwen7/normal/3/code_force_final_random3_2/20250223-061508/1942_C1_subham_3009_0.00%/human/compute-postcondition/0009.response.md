Output State: **`t` is greater than -1, `__name__` is `__main__`, `[n, x, y]` is a list containing three integers split from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the first `x` elements of the list `[n, x, y]` to integers**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it `t - 1`. Since `t` was initially greater than 0, `t - 1` is now greater than -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
