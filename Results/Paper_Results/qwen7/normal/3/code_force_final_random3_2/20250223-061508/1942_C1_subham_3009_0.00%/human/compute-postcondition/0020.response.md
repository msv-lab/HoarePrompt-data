Output State: `t` is 0, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `t > 0`. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Given that the loop executes until `t` reaches 0, after all iterations, `t` will be 0. All other variables (`__name__`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
