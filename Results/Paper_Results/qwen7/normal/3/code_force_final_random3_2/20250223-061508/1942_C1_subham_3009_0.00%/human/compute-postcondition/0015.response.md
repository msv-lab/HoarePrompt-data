Output State: **`t` is now `t-1`, `__name__` is `__main__`, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer from the input corresponding to its index.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it `t-1`. The other variables (`__name__`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
