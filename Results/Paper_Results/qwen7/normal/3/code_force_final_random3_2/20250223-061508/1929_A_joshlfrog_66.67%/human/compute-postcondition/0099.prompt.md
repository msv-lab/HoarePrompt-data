You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `e` will be equal to `t-1`, `l` will be the total length of the list `nums` for each iteration, `i` will be `l-1`, `x` will be the maximum value found across all lists `nums` during the iterations, and `y` will be the minimum value found across all lists `nums` during the iterations.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `e` will have reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `l` is set to the length of the input list `nums`, `i` iterates from `0` to `l-1`, updating `x` to the highest value and `y` to the lowest value in each list `nums`. The final values of `x` and `y` will be the overall maximum and minimum values found across all the lists `nums` provided as inputs during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each 't' test cases, 'n' is an integer between 2 and 100 followed by 'n' integers 'a_1, a_2, ..., a_n' each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns results based on the processed input data for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
