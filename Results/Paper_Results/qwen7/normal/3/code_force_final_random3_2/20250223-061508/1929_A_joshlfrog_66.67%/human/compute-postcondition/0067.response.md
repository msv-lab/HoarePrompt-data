Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `e` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code sets `x` to 0. The values of `i`, `e`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `x` is updated to 0, and `y` retains its initial state as the minimum value found in the list `nums`.
