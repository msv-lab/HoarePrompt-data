Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `e` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `nums`. The values of `i`, `e`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to reflect the maximum and minimum values found in the newly created list `nums`. The list `nums` itself is now populated with integers entered by the user.
