Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is `nums[i]`, and `y` is equal to `nums[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `nums[i]` to `y`. Since `i` was previously `i + 2`, `e` was 1, and `l` was an input integer, these values remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now `nums[i]`, and `y` is also set to `nums[i]`.
