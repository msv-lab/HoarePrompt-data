Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `nums[2]`, and `x` remains unchanged whether `nums[i]` is greater than `y` or not. Since there is no else part, the value of `x` does not change regardless of the condition in the if statement.
