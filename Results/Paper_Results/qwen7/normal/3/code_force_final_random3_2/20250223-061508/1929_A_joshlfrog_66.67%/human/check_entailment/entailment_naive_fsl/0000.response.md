Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program aims to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach for calculating the maximum beauty as defined.

The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging them in a specific order. The program fails to implement this logic. For example, consider the input:

```
3
2 1 3
```

The program outputs `2`, but the correct maximum beauty is `2` (by rearranging the array to `[1, 3, 2]`), not `2` (as the program calculates the difference between the max and min values). Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly.
