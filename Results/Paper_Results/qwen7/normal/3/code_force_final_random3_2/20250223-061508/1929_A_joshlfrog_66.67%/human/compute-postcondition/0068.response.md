Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `e` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000**.

The code sets `y` to the value `100000000`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `e`, `l`, `x`, or the initial value of `y`. Therefore, `i` remains `l-1`, `e` remains 2, `l` remains an input integer, `x` remains 0, and `y` is now explicitly set to `100000000`.
