Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `l`, `e` is 2, `l` is the input integer, `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `l`, indicating that the loop has executed for each index in the list `nums`. The variable `e` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the list `nums`, as it gets updated whenever a value in `nums[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`. Similarly, the variable `y` will hold the minimum value found in the list `nums`, as it gets updated whenever a value in `nums[i]` is smaller than the current value of `y`.
