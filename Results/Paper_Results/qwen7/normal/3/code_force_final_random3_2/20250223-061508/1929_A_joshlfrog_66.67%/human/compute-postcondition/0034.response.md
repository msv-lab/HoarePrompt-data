Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 1, `l` is the total length of the list `nums`, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`, and `l` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `l`. The other variables (`t`, `e`, `i`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `l` is updated to the input integer, which is now the total length of the list `nums`.
