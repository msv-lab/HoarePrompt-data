Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `l`
- `e` is 2
- `l` is the input integer
- `x` is the maximum value found in the list `nums`
- `y` is the minimum value found in the list `nums`

The print statement is `print(x - y)`, which calculates the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the list `nums`.

Since `x` is the maximum value in `nums` and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, the expression `x - y` computes the range of the list `nums`.

Output: **the range of the list nums (where the range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums)**
