Output State: **`len_a` is at least 1, `count_a` is increased by 1, `len_b` is greater than `i + 2`, `count_b` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `count_b += 1` increments the value of `count_b` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `len_a` remains at least 1, `count_a` is increased by 1 (as per the initial state), `len_b` is still greater than `i + 2`, and `count_b` is increased by 1.
