Output State: **`count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`**.

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `count_a` and `count_b`, both to 0. The values of `t`, `b`, `len_a`, and `len_b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
