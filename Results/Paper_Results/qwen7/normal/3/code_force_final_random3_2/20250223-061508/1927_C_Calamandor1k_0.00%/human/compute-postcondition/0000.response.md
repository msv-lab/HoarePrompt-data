Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we have read one line of input which contains the value of `t`.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains its original constraints but now holds the specific integer value read from the input. All other conditions and constraints on `n`, `m`, `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they have not been referenced or modified in the given code snippet.
