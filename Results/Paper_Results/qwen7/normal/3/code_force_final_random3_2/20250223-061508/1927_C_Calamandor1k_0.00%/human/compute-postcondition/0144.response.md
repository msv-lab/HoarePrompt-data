Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes integers t, n, m, k, and two arrays a and b. The function returns information based on the given conditions and arrays.**

- The function processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts integers t, n, m, and k, where t is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), n and m are positive integers within the range 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and k is an even integer within the range 2 to \(2 \cdot \min(n, m)\).
- It also accepts two arrays, a and b, each containing n and m integers respectively, with each integer in the range 1 to \(10^6\) inclusive.
- The function returns information based on the provided conditions and arrays for each test case.
