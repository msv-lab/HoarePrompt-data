To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i`: Equal to the maximum value between `len_a` and `len_b`.
   - `count_a`: Incremented by 1 for every index `i` where `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than the length of `a`.
   - `count_b`: Incremented by 1 for every index `i` where `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than the length of `b`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The print statement checks if `count_a` is greater than or equal to `d` and `count_b` is greater than or equal to `d`.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

Given these details, the output depends on the values of `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d`.

- If `count_a >= d` and `count_b >= d`, the output will be `'YES'`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `'NO'`.

Since the exact values of `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the conditions specified.

Output: **'YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO'**
