Postcondition: **`len_a` is at least 1, `count_a` is increased by 1, `len_b` must be greater than `i_prev + 3`, `count_b` is increased by 1, and the condition `b[i_prev + 1] <= k` is still valid.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `len_a > i + 1` is true or false, the variables `len_a`, `count_a`, `len_b`, and `count_b` retain their respective changes, and the condition `b[i_prev + 1] <= k` remains unchanged.
