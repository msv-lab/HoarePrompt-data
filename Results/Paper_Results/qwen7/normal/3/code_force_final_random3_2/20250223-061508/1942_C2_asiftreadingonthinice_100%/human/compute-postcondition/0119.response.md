Output State: **`ans` is increased by `i`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decreased by `i - 1`, where `i` is the first element of `tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `ans` is still increased by `i`, and `y` is now `y - (i - 1)`.
