Output State: **`ans` is the sum of all `i` values where `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1` plus the current value of `y`, and `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans += y` adds the current value of `y` to `ans`. Since `y` is set to 0 at the end of the loop, the only addition to `ans` is the last value of `y` before it was reset to 0. All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
