Output State: **`ans` is increased by `i`, `tmp` must contain the appropriate values based on the conditions described, and `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += i` increments the value of `ans` by the current value of `i`. The values of `tmp` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state because they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `tmp` still contains the appropriate values based on the conditions described, and `y` remains greater than or equal to `i - 1`.
