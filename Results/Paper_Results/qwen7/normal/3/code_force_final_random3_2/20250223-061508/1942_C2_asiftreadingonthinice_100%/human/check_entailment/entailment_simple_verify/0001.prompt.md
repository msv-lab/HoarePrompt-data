You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: After all iterations, `ans` will be the minimum value between the final accumulated value of `ans + y` and `n - 2`, and `y` will be 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - It calculates an initial answer `ans` as `x + y - 2`. This accounts for the minimum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices plus any additional vertices.
   - It then sorts the list `a` to facilitate the next steps.

3. **Checking Adjacent Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` to check pairs of adjacent vertices.
     - If the difference between consecutive vertices is exactly 2, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating an additional triangle can be formed.
     - If the difference is even, it adds half of the difference to a temporary list `tmp`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - It checks the gap between the first and last vertices in the sorted list `a`.
     - If the difference is 2, it increments `ans` by 1.
     - If the difference is even, it adds half of the difference to `tmp`.

5. **Optimizing Additional Triangles:**
   - The program sorts `tmp` and iteratively tries to use up the available `y` vertices to form additional triangles.
     - For each element in `tmp`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, it adds `i` to `ans` and reduces `y` by `i - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - It adds any remaining `y` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` to ensure the answer does not exceed the total number of possible triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  8 4 2
  1 6 2 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  6
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - Initial `ans` = 4 (x + y - 2) = 4 + 2 - 2 = 4.
  - Checking differences:
    - Difference between 1 and 6 is 5 (not considered as it's not 2).
    - Difference between 6 and 2 is 4 (add 2 to `tmp`).
    - Difference between 2 and 5 is 3 (not considered as it's not 2).
  - Sorting `tmp` gives [2].
  - Using 2 from `tmp`:
    - `ans` = 4 + 2 = 6.
    - Remaining `y` = 0.
  - Final `ans` = 6 (which is less than `n - 2 = 6`).

#### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  ```
  7 3 1
  6 4 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  5
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - Initial `ans` = 4 (x + y - 2) = 3 + 1 - 2 = 2.
  - Checking differences:
    - Difference between 6 and 4 is 2 (add 1 to `tmp`).
    - Difference between 4 and 3 is 1 (not considered as it's not 2).
  - Sorting `tmp` gives [1].
  - Using 1 from `tmp`:
    - `ans` = 2 + 1 = 3.
    - Remaining `y` = 0.
  - Final `ans` = 3 (which is less than `n - 2 = 5`).

#### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4 2 2
  1 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - Initial `ans` = 2 (x + y - 2) = 2 + 2 - 2 = 2.
  - Checking differences:
    - Difference between 1 and 3 is 2 (add 1 to `tmp`).
  - Sorting `tmp` gives [1].
  - Using 1 from `tmp`:
    - `ans` = 2 + 1 = 3.
    - Remaining `y` = 1.
  - Final `ans` = 3 (which is less than `n - 2 = 2`).

### Conclusion

The program logic seems to correctly handle the problem constraints and examples provided. Therefore, the program appears to be correct.
