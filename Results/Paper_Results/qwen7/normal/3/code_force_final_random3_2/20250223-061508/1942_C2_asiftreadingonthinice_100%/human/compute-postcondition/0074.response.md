Output State: **`tmp` is an empty list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is the final accumulated value of `ans + y`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`tmp`, `y`, `ans`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, they retain their initial states. The list `a` is updated to be a sorted version of its original state.
