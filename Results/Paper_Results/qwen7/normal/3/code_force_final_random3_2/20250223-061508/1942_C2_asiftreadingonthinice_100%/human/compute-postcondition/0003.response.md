Output State: **`tt` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `ii` is 0 and must be less than `tt`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer using map and int.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
