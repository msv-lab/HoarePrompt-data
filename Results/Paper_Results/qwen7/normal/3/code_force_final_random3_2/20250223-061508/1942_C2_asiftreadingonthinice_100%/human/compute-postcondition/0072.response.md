Output State: **`tmp` is an empty list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is the final accumulated value of `ans + y`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `tmp`, `ans`, and `ii` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `tmp` remains an empty list, `y` is now an integer (specifically, the third integer input), `ans` is the final accumulated value of `ans + y` (since `y` is now known), `ii` is incremented by 1, and `tt` must be greater than `ii + 1` (which is now `ii + 2`).
