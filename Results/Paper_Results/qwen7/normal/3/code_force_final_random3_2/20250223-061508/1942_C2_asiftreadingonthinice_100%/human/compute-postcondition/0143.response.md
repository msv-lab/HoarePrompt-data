Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input, `ans` is x + y - 2, `y` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions, `ii` is `ii_current + 1`, `tt` is `tt_current`, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
