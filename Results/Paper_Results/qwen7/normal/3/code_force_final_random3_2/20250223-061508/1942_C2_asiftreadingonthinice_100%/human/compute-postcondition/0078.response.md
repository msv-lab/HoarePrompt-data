Postcondition: `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, the current value of `a[i]` minus the current value of `a[i - 1]` equals 2.
