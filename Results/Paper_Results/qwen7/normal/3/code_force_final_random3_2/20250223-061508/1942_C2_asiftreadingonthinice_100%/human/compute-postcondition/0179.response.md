Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, and `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each occurrence where `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` for all `i` in the range of 1 to `len(a) - 1`. Additionally, `tmp` now includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` to the list `tmp`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
