Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, and `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each occurrence where `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` for all `i` in the range of 1 to `len(a) - 1`. Additionally, if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` now includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2; `tmp` is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tmp` must contain the appropriate values based on the conditions described, and `y` is updated to `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, `y` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in `tmp` (if it exists), and `y` is either decreased by `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, or remains unchanged. Additionally, `ans` is increased by `i` if the condition `y >= i - 1` is true; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` is a list of integers that does not contain the previous value of `i`, `i` is the next element in the updated `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is incremented by `i - 1`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
