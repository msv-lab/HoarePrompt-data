Output State: **`tt` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `ii` is 0 and must be less than `tt`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
