Output State: **`tt` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `ii` is 0 and must be less than `tt`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**

The code assigns the value of `x + y - 2` to the variable `ans`. The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
