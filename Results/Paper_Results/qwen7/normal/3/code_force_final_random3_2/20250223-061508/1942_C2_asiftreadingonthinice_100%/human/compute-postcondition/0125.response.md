Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + i`, `y` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `ans += i` updates the value of `ans` by adding the current value of `i` to it. The variable `y` is not affected by this operation and remains unchanged from its previous state. The value of `i` is updated to the next element in `tmp`, but since we are focusing on the loop head and the immediate effect of the given line of code, we only update `ans`.
