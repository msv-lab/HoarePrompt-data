Postcondition: `tmp` is a non-empty list, `y` is an integer. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is equal to its original value minus `(i - 1)`, and `ans` is increased by `i`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and the values of `y` and `ans` remain unchanged from their preconditions.
