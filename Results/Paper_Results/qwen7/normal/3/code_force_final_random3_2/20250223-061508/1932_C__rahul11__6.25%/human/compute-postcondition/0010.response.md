Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies that the variable `i` is an element of `arr`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is equal to the current value of `ans` multiplied by `i`.
   - `i` is an element of `arr`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from `arr` and `ans` is updated based on `i`, the next `i` should be the next element in `arr`.
   - After processing `i`, `ans` will be updated to `ans * i`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `ans` will be the current value of `ans` multiplied by this next element.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`ans` is equal to the current value of `ans` multiplied by the next element in `arr`, and `i` is the next element of `arr`**.
