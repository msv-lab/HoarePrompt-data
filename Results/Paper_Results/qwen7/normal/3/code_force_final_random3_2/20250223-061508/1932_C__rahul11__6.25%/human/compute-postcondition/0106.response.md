Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking a single line of space-separated integers from the user input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
