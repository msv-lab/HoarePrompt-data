Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `s` is a list of characters from an input string**.

The code `s = list(input())` takes an input string from the user and converts it into a list of characters. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
