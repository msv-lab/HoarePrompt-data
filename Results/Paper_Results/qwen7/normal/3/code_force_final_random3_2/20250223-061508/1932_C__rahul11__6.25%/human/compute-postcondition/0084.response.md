Output State: **`k` is 2, `l` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[1] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is incremented by 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `k` was initially 2, `ans` was updated to `ans // arr[1] % MOD`, `res[c]` was set to `ans % m % MOD`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is incremented by 1, and `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`. After executing `l += 1`, `l` becomes 1. All other variables retain their previous conditions.
