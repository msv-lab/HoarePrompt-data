Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[1] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `l`, we assume `l` is the same as `k-1` (as per the previous line), which means `l` is 1. So, `ans` is now `ans // arr[1] % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.
