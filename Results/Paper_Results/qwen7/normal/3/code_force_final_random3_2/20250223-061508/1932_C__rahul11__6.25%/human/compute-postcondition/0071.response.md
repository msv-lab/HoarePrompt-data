Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `k` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in the array, and the current value of `s[k]` is 'L'**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[l]` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The values of `k`, `n`, and `s[k]` remain unchanged.
