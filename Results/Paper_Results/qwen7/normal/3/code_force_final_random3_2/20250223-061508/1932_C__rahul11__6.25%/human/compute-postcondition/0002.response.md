Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
