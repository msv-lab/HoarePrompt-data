Output State: **`k` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[k] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is incremented by 1.**

In this step, the variable `c` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `k`, `ans`, `res[c]`, `n`, and `r` retain their previous values, and `c` now holds the new value which is one more than its previous value.
