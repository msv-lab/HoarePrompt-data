Postcondition: `c` is either 2 or 3; `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`; `m` is an integer entered by the user; `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least three elements; `s` is a list of characters from an input string; `ans` is adjusted according to whether `s[k]` is 'L' or not; `i` is the last or second last element of `arr`; `l` is 3 or 1 or 2 or 0; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`; `k` is 1; and `n` is at least 1. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is adjusted to `ans // arr[2] % MOD`, otherwise `ans` is adjusted to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, where `r` is decremented by 1.
