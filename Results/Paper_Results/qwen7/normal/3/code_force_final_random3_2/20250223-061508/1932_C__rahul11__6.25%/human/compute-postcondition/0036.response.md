Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is `r - 1`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to `res[c]`. Since `ans`, `m`, and `MOD` are unchanged, their states remain the same. The only new information is that `res[c]` now holds the value of `ans % m % MOD`. The other variables (`k`, `n`, `arr`, `r`) also remain unchanged from their initial states.
