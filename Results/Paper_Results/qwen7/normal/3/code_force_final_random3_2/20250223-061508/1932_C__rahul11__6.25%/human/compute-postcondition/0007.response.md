Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `arr`, the initial value of `i` can be any of the elements in `arr`. However, since the loop body is omitted, we don't know the exact value of `i` at the start of the loop. We only know that `i` will take on each value in `arr` during the iterations.

3. **Check the state of `arr`**: The list `arr` is already defined and contains integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The state of `arr` does not need to be adjusted because it is already given.

4. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `res`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be considered for the loop to execute is the state of `i` within the context of `arr`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is an element of `arr`**
