Output State: **`res` is a list of `n` zeros, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `s` is a list of characters from an input string.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `res` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The values of `m`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
