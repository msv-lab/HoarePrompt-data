Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to construct a string based on the given trace array. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **String Construction**:
   - A list `s` of length `l` initialized to zero is used to keep track of the cumulative counts.
   - For each index `j` in the trace array, the program appends the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` (which maps to 'a' when `s[j]` is 0, 'b' when `s[j]` is 1, etc.) to the string `ans`.
   - The value at `s[j]` is then incremented by 1.

3. **Guaranteed Validity**: The problem statement guarantees that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string `s`. The program respects this constraint by ensuring that the characters appended to `ans` are always within the bounds of the alphabet ('a' to 'z').

4. **Output**: The constructed string `ans` is printed for each test case.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the logic required to generate a string from the trace array as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
