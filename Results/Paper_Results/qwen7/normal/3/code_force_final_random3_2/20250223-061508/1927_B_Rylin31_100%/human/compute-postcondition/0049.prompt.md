Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n, and for each test case, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is a string composed of characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration, and `s` is updated such that each `s[j]` value reflects the total number of times `j` was encountered in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the string 'aa', `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0 except for `s[j]` which is now 3, `j` is the last element from the list `s` (i.e., `l-1`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `ans` is "cat", `j` is equal to the length of the `array`, and all elements in `s` are incremented by the number of iterations (3 in this case).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
