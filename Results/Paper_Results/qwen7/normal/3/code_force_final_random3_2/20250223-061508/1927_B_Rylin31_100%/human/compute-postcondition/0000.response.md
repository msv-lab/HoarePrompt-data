Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized by the `range` function using the value from `input()`.
   
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop will start with `i` being set to 0 (since `range(start, stop)` generates values from `start` to `stop-1`). After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1.

3. **Determine the Value of `input()`**: The value of `input()` determines how many times the loop will run. Since `t` is the input value and `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `input()` will return a value between 1 and \(10^4\).

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the state of the object involved in the loop head, which is `input()`.

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute as long as `input()` returns a value greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value returned by `input()`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`input()` returns a value between 1 and \(10^4\)**
