Output State: **`ans` is a string composed of characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration, and `s` is updated such that each `s[j]` value reflects the total number of times `j` was encountered in the loop.**

To explain this output state in more detail:
- The variable `ans` accumulates characters based on the values in the list `s`. For each `j` in `array`, the character `chr(s[j] + 97)` is appended to `ans`.
- After each iteration, `s[j]` is incremented by 1, meaning that the count of how many times each index `j` has been processed is stored in `s`.
- By the end of all iterations, `ans` will be a string where each character corresponds to the final value of `s[j]` after processing all elements in `array`, and `s` will reflect the total count of occurrences of each index in `array`.
