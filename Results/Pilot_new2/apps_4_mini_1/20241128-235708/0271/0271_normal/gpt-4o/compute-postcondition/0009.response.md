The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads an integer input `n`, which is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. The function calculates the last digit of `n` (the remainder when `n` is divided by 10) and uses this remainder to determine the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from `n`; otherwise, it adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n`. The final result, which is the nearest multiple of 10, is printed out.

However, the function lacks any return statement and simply prints the result instead of returning it, which could be considered a missing functionality as noted in the annotations. Additionally, there are no checks for invalid input; it assumes the user will always input a valid non-negative integer.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads a non-negative integer from input, calculates the nearest multiple of 10 based on the last digit of that integer, and prints the result. It does not return any value. **
