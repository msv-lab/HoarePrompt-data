`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Since `remainder` is `n % 10`, it represents the last digit of `n`. Given that the value of `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is effectively the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`, which is between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and less than or equal to 5; `result` is equal to `n - remainder`.**
