`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), after the input it remains within this range. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `n` is equal to the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `n` is equal to the input integer.**
