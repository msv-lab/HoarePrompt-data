The `print(n)` statement outputs the current value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer and a multiple of 10. The value of `n` is not modified by this operation, and no new variables are created. The initial state remains valid, but we now know the value of `n` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 10^9, `n` is equal to the input integer, and `n` has been printed.**
