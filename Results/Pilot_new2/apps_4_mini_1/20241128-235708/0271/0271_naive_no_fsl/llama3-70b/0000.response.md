Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how the code works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input.

2. **Check for Exact Multiple of 10**: The first condition checks if `n` is already a multiple of 10 (i.e., if `n % 10 == 0`). If this is true, it prints `n` directly, which is correct as it means it is already rounded.

3. **Rounding Down**: If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the next condition checks if the last digit (i.e., `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5. If this condition is true, the program calculates the nearest lower multiple of 10 by subtracting the last digit from `n` (i.e., `n - n % 10`) and prints it. This is correct because rounding down to the nearest multiple of 10 is appropriate.

4. **Rounding Up**: If the last digit is greater than 5, the program calculates the nearest higher multiple of 10 by adding the difference to reach the next multiple of 10 (i.e., `n + (10 - n % 10)`). This is also correct as it rounds up to the next multiple of 10.

The program handles the edge cases effectively, including when `n` is exactly 0 or 10^9. It also accommodates the ambiguity in rounding (e.g., `n=5` can round to either `0` or `10`).

All potential test cases, including the provided examples and edge cases, yield the expected results. Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Overall, there are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, confirming its correctness.
