Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the concept of "s-palindrome" as defined in the problem description. The key issue lies in the fact that the program checks for standard palindromes, which are symmetric in both halves, while the definition of "s-palindrome" requires that the second half is a mirror reflection of the first half.

Specifically, the function `func_1` compares characters from the start and end of the string, but it does not account for the requirement that the two halves must be mirror images of each other. For example, the string "oXoxoXo" is "s-palindrome," but the function would erroneously evaluate it as a palindrome without ensuring the halves are mirror reflections. 

In the case of "aa," the function would incorrectly handle it as a valid palindrome when, according to the definition provided, it is not an "s-palindrome."

Thus, the function does not adhere to the problem's definition for all cases, leading to the determination of correctness as False.
