#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 characters.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 characters, `n` is at least 2, the characters compared in all iterations are equal, and `i` is half of `n` minus 1 if `n` is even or half of `n` if `n` is odd.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 characters and checks if it is a palindrome. It returns True if `s` reads the same forwards and backwards, and False if it does not. The function only handles the case of even-length strings adequately since it compares characters until the halfway point, thus it also works correctly for odd-length palindromes. However, the return postconditions do not clarify that False is returned for any non-palindrome comparisons, thus the function can return False in multiple scenarios where the characters do not match.
