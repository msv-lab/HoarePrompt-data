According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n // 2`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and we know `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, `n // 2` will be at least 1 (since with `n` being 3, `n // 2` equals 1).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Thus, `i` must now be less than `n // 2`, which means `n` must be greater than 4 because `n // 2` should be at least 2 for the loop to run again.
