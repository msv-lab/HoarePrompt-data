Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is now 0. If the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in the string `s` are not equal, then `is_palindrome` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
