The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of which we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `n` must be greater than 4; `i` is 2; `is_spalindrome` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
