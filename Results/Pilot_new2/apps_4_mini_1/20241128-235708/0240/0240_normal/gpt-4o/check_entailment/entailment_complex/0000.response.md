Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description due to several issues. 

1. **Undefined Variable**: In `is_valid_number`, the variable `n_len` is used without being defined within the function. This leads to a situation where the length check cannot be accurately conducted, meaning that the function may return incorrect results.

2. **Inefficient Permutation Generation**: The `generate_possible_numbers` function generates all permutations of the remaining characters. For large inputs, especially those approaching the maximum constraint of 1,000,000 digits, the number of permutations could be astronomically high, leading to performance issues. This is impractical and does not guarantee that the smallest possible number will be found efficiently.

3. **Missing Handling of Leading Zeros**: Although the problem description mentions that there are no leading zeroes in the integer `n` (except for the case where `n` is 0), the function does not handle cases where the generated number may begin with leading zeros due to the way permutations are generated. This can lead to results that do not comply with the stated requirements.

4. **Incorrect Assumption in Validity Check**: The `is_valid_number` function should check if the generated candidate number and the remembered substring can coexist in a valid arrangement, keeping in mind the total length of the number should account for the number of digits of `k` appended. The current implementation does not correctly enforce this rule.

These issues indicate that there are potential cases where the program may not produce the correct output as expected by the problem description, making the program incorrect overall.
