According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more permutations of `chars` to process. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, which indicates that it has been processed. 

Now, for the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to take on the next permutation of `chars`. Since the loop variable `perm` gets updated with each iteration to the next permutation, we need to consider that the next permutation will be generated.

Since `candidate` is being assigned the current `perm`, it will also be updated to the next permutation in the next iteration. The permutations of `chars` will continue until all permutations are exhausted. However, we need to ensure that the loop will execute as long as there are more permutations available.

Thus, `perm` will be the next permutation and `candidate` will reflect whatever the next permutation is, and we need to ensure that `candidate` remains a valid number in relation to `sub`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
