The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means it is constructed by concatenating the characters in the permutation `perm`. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` becomes equal to `perm`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
