The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means `candidate` becomes a string that is the concatenation of the elements in `perm`. The value of `perm` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is stated to be the next permutation of `chars`. Therefore, `candidate` represents the next permutation of `chars` as a string.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `''.join(perm)` (which is the next permutation of `chars` as a string).

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to the next permutation of `chars` as a string.**
