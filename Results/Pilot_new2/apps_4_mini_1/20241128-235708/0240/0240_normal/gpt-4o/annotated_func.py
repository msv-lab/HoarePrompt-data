#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty substring of s that may contain leading zeroes.
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `n_len` is equal to `len(s) - len(sub)`, `s_counter` is updated such that `s_counter` contains the count of each digit in `s` decremented by the count of each digit in `sub`, `sub_counter` remains unchanged.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'possible_numbers' based on integer comparison, which is the smallest number that can be formed from the remaining characters after accounting for the substring 'sub' in the string 's'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string of digits `s` and a non-empty substring `sub`, and it returns the smallest number that can be formed from the characters remaining in `s` after removing all occurrences of `sub`. It handles cases where `sub` has leading zeroes and ensures that the smallest number is determined through integer comparison of the possible combinations. If `sub` is not found in `s`, all characters of `s` are considered, and the smallest number is derived from the complete string `s`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string consisting of digits that may contain leading zeroes.
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if 'sub' is found within 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to n_len, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `num_str` and `sub`, both of which are non-empty strings consisting of digits. It returns True if `sub` is found within `num_str` and `num_str` has a length equal to `n_len`, which is not defined in the code but is implied to be a variable representing a specific length. If either condition is not met, it returns False. However, since `n_len` is not defined or set within the function, the functionality as described cannot be accurately fulfilled. Thus, the function will always check the presence of `sub` in `num_str` without a proper length comparison, leading to potentially unexpected behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length up to 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty substring made up of digits that may contain leading zeroes.
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` contains all permutations of `chars`, and `candidate` contains all valid permutations as numbers in relation to `sub`. If no valid permutations exist, no candidates are yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `chars` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub` made up of digits. It generates all possible permutations of `chars` and yields those permutations that are considered valid according to the `is_valid_number` function in relation to `sub`. If no valid permutations are found, the function yields nothing. Note that the function could potentially generate a large number of permutations, which may lead to performance issues if `chars` is very long.
