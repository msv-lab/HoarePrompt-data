The code `n += c` means that the value of `n` will have the character `c` appended to it. However, `n` remains unchanged if `c` is not in `t_set`. 

Given that `s` is a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer and `c` is the next character in `s`, we need to analyze the effect on `n` based on whether `c` exists in `t_set`.

1. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` will change to `n + c`, where `c` is treated as a string concatenation.
2. If `c` is not in `t_set`, then `n` will remain unchanged.

Since we do not know the specific content of `s`, `c`, or `t_set`, we can summarize the output state based on these conditions.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer, `c` is the next character in `s`, `n` is either unchanged or updated to `n + c` if `c` is in `t_set`.**
