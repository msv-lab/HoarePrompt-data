The variable `n` is assigned an empty string. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer with a maximum length of 1,000,000 characters; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that may contain leading zeroes; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`; `n` is an empty string.
