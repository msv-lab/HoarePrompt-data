The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, along with a list of `n` integers representing colors and a list of `m` integers representing target counts for those colors. It checks if there exists a contiguous subsequence of colors that matches the specified counts of each unique color. If such a subsequence is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly handle cases with invalid input ranges or empty lists, assuming inputs adhere to the constraints defined by the problem statement.
