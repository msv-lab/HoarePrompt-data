To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights such that there are exactly `k_1` knights with lightsabers of the first color, `k_2` knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., `k_m` knights with lightsabers of the m-th color.
- The program should print "YES" if such an interval exists, otherwise it should print "NO".

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads integers `n` and `m` which represent the number of Jedi Knights and the number of colors.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers that denote the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights.
   - Finally, it reads a list of `m` integers that represent the desired counts of each color.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `color_counts` to count occurrences of each color in the `colors` list. This part is correct as it builds a frequency map of the lightsaber colors.

3. **Finding Contiguous Intervals:**
   - The program checks each possible contiguous subarray (using two nested loops).
   - For each subarray defined by indices `i` and `j`, it builds a `window_counts` dictionary to count occurrences of colors in that subarray.
   - It then checks whether the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts` list. This is done using the `all` function and the `zip` function for comparison.

4. **Output:**
   - If a valid interval is found, it sets `found` to `True` and breaks out of the loops, eventually printing "YES". If no valid interval is found, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find any contiguous subarray that matches the given requirements of Jedi counts by colors.
- It properly checks all possible contiguous intervals and compares their counts with the required counts.
- The program efficiently utilizes dictionaries to count the colors and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
- The implementation adheres to the problem description requirements and correctly checks for the existence of the required counts in a contiguous interval.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
