The variable `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The value of `color` is `colors[2]`, and it has previously been established that `color` is not in `window_counts`, so `window_counts[color]` was set to 0 before this operation. Therefore, after this line of code, `window_counts[color]` will be equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1**.
