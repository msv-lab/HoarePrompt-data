Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `color` is `colors[2]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is now 0; if all counts match their respective targets, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
