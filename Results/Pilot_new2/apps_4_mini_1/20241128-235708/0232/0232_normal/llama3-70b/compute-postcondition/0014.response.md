The variable `color_counts[color]` is being assigned the value `0`. This means that regardless of its previous count, the count for `color` is reset to `0`. The preconditions regarding `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `color` remain valid and unchanged after this assignment. Therefore, the Output State will specify the value of `color_counts[color]` after the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list that contains at least 3 colors, `color` is the third color in the list, `color_counts[color]` is now 0.**
