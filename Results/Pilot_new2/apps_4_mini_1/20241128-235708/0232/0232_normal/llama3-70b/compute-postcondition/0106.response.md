Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `color` is `colors[4]`, and `window_counts[color]` is 0 with `found` being True if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`. If `color` is present in `window_counts`, no changes are made to the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `color`, `window_counts[color]`, or `found`.***
