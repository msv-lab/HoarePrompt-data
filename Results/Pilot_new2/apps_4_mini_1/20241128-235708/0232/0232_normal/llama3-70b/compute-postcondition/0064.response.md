`color` is assigned the value `colors[j]`, where `j` is 2. The variable `color` will now hold the color from the third position of the `colors` array (index 2). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1.**
