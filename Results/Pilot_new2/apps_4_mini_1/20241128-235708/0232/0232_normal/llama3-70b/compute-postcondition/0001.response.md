The variable `colors` is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. This means it will contain integers that are inputted as space-separated values. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as the code only affects the `colors` variable. Therefore, the output state will include the unchanged values of `n` and `m`, along with the new variable `colors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers from the input.**
