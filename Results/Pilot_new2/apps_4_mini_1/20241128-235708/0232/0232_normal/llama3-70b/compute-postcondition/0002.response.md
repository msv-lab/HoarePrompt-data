The variable `counts` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function over the input received from `input().split()`. The initial state indicates that `colors` is a list of integers from the input, which implies the input will be split into components and converted to integers. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `colors`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers from the input, and `counts` is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers from the input, `counts` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
