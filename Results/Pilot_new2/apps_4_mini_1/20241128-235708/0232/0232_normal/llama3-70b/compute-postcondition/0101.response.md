The code contains a `break` statement, which causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or switch statement it is currently executing. The values of the variables do not change, and there are no variable assignments or calculations that occur as a result of the `break`. Therefore, the output state will retain all the previous variable states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `color` is `colors[3]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
