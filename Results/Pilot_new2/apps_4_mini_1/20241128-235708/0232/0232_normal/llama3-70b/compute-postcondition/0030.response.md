Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `color` is `colors[0]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
