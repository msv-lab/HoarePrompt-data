The variable `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and the state of `found` and `counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, if `found` is True, then `window_counts` matches the corresponding values in `counts`, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, if `found` is True, then `window_counts` matches the corresponding values in `counts`, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.**
