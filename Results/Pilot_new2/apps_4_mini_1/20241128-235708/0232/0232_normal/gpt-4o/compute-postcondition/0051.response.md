Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to `original value of n + k + 1`, `right` is equal to the original value of n, and `current_counts[color]` must be greater than `desired_counts[color]` for at least one color in `desired_counts`. If the current counts match the desired counts for all colors, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the current counts for at least one color exceed the desired counts. Otherwise, there is no action taken.***
