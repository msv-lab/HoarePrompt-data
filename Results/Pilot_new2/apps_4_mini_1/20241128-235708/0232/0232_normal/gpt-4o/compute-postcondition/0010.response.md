Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers (each in the range {1, 2, ..., m}), `k` is a list of `m` integers (with 1 ≤ ∑ k_i ≤ n), `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping color numbers (1 to m) to their corresponding counts in `k`, `current_counts` has at least one color count that is less than its corresponding count in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 0.**
