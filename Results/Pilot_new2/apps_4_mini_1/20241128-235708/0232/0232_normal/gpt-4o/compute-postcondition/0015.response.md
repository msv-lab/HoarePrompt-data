The variable `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is unknown, but it is part of a range of indices. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers within their specified ranges, `colors` is a list of integers corresponding to those ranges, `k` is a list of integers with a sum within the limits, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping color numbers to their counts, `current_counts` has been updated such that `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1, and `left` is increased by 1.
