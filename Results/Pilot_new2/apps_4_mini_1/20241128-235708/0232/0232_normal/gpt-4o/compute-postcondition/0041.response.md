According to the code, the for loop iterates over `right`, which runs from 0 to `n - 1`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `right` has reached its maximum possible value for the loop based on the original value of `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `right` needs to be increased by 1. 

Since `right` is currently equal to the original value of `n` (as it loops from 0 to `n-1`), and given that the loop has executed `k` times up to this point (where `k` is at least 1), `n` must have been at least `k`. This means before the next iteration, `right` should be `n`, which is outside the current loop's range, and it implies that for an additional loop execution to take place, `n` must be incremented.

Thus, after adjusting, the conditions should reflect that `n` must be greater than the original value and `right` should be equal to `n`.

State: **`left` is equal to `original value of n + k`, `right` is equal to the original value of `n`, and `n` must be greater than the original value of `n`.**
