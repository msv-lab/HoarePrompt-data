To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we start by analyzing both the code and the description.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
- We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
- The results can be:
  - "+" if upvotes are greater than downvotes (considering the unknown votes).
  - "-" if downvotes are greater than upvotes.
  - "0" if upvotes equal downvotes and there are no unknown votes.
  - "?" if the presence of unknown votes leads to more than one possible result.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
if x > y + z:
    print('+')
elif x < y:
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Analyzing Each Condition:
1. **`if x > y + z:`** 
   - This checks if the total upvotes are greater than downvotes plus all unknown votes. If true, print "+".
   
2. **`elif x < y:`**
   - This checks if upvotes are strictly less than downvotes. If true, print "-".
   
3. **`elif x == y:`**
   - If upvotes equal downvotes, we check if there are unknown votes:
     - If `z == 0`, it means no unknown votes, and the result is definitively "0".
     - If `z > 0`, the result could swing either way depending on how the unknown votes are cast, thus print "?".
   
4. **`else:`**
   - This captures any condition where `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but does not fulfill previous conditions (implying there are unknown votes), thus also printing "?".

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- Case `(0, 0, 1)`:
  - `x == y`, with `z > 0`. The code correctly prints "?".
  
- Case `(0, 0, 0)`:
  - `x == y`, with `z == 0`. The code should correctly print "0".
  
- Case `(3, 7, 0)`:
  - The program prints "-" as expected.
  
- Case `(2, 0, 1)`:
  - The program prints "+" as expected.
  
The output hints are consistent with the code logic.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and the edge cases, the program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description without missing any potential cases. Each possible scenario, including edge cases, is handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**.
