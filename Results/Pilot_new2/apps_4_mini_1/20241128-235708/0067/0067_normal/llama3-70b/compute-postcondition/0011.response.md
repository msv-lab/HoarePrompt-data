The code simply prints a question mark but does not affect any variables or their values. Therefore, the initial conditions remain valid, and no variables have been changed. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`. The value of `z` is greater than 0.**
