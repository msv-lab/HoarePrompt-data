The code provided is a print statement which outputs the character '+'. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged since there are no assignments or modifications made to them. 

The initial state indicates that `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`. This condition still holds true after executing the print statement. 

Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are still non-negative integers satisfying the initial conditions, the output state should reflect that along with the print output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100` and `x > y + z`; output is '+'**
