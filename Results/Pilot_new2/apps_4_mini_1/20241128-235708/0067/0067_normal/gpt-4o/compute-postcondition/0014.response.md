The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` that are implicitly defined within the function and must satisfy the condition that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. However, since there are no inputs to the function, we focus solely on the output. Since the output details have not been specified, we cannot define what the function returns. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot accurately describe the functionality of the function without additional output details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
