The code assigns the value of `y + z` to `max_downvotes`. The previous values of the affected variables are `y` and `z`, both of which are non-negative integers. Therefore, `max_downvotes` will be equal to `y + z`, which is a non-negative integer as well. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
