Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, then '+' has been printed. Otherwise, `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.***
