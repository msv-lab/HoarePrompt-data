The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, and the relationship between `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` also stays intact. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.**
