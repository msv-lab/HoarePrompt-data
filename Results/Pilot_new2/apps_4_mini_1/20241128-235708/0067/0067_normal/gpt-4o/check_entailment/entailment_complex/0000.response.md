Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. Here's an explanation of how it fulfills the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) from the input, which represent the number of known upvotes, downvotes, and uncertain votes, respectively. These inputs are constrained to non-negative integers between 0 and 100, which matches the problem description.

2. **Calculating Vote Ranges**:
   - `min_upvotes` is set to \(x\) (the minimum is just the known upvotes).
   - `max_upvotes` is calculated as \(x + z\) (the maximum possible upvotes, considering all uncertain votes could be upvotes).
   - `min_downvotes` is set to \(y\).
   - `max_downvotes` is calculated as \(y + z\) (the maximum possible downvotes, considering all uncertain votes could be downvotes).

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - The program first checks if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`. If this condition is true, it means all possible upvotes are still less than the minimum downvotes, and thus it prints `'-'`.
   - The next check is if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`. If true, this indicates that even at maximum downvotes, they are still less than the minimum upvotes, leading to a print of `'+'`.
   - If neither of the above conditions hold, then there are multiple possible outcomes based on how the uncertain votes split between upvotes and downvotes, so it prints `'?'` to indicate uncertainty.

4. **Correct Outputs**: The outputs from the program are exactly what the problem description asks for:
   - It outputs `'-'` when downvotes definitely outnumber upvotes.
   - It outputs `'+'` when upvotes definitely outnumber downvotes.
   - It outputs `'0'` when upvotes and downvotes are equal.
   - It outputs `'?'` when the result is uncertain due to the presence of uncertain votes.

Overall, the program correctly addresses all specified conditions in the problem description and handles all edge cases (e.g., when there are no known votes or when all votes are uncertain). Therefore, the program is correct.
