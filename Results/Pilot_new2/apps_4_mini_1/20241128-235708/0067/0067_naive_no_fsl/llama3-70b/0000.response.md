Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the situation where the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal and there are unknown voters (`z > 0`). 

For example, consider the input:

```
1 1 1
```

In this case:
- Upvotes (`x`) = 1
- Downvotes (`y`) = 1
- Unknown votes (`z`) = 1

Here, depending on how the single unknown voter votes, the result can be:
- If the unknown voter upvotes, the result is `2 (upvotes) > 1 (downvotes)` which results in `+`.
- If the unknown voter downvotes, the result is `1 (upvotes) < 2 (downvotes)` which results in `-`.

Since there are two possible results (`+` and `-`), the output should be `?` indicating the result is uncertain. However, the code will output `?`, which is correct. 

But let's consider a similar case:

```
2 2 1
```

For this input:
- Upvotes (`x`) = 2
- Downvotes (`y`) = 2
- Unknown votes (`z`) = 1

Possible results are:
- If the unknown voter upvotes, the result is `3 (upvotes) > 2 (downvotes)` which results in `+`.
- If the unknown voter downvotes, the result is `2 (upvotes) < 3 (downvotes)` which results in `-`.

The expected output should be `?` since the result is uncertain. The program would correctly return `?`, which is correct.

However, there is a specific edge case that is not handled correctly:

For the input:

```
0 0 0
```

In this case:
- Upvotes (`x`) = 0
- Downvotes (`y`) = 0
- Unknown votes (`z`) = 0

Here, there are no votes at all, so the result should be `0`. The code will return `0`, which is correct.

However, the case where `x` and `y` are equal and `z` is positive (as shown above) creates uncertainty and should yield `?`. 

Hence, the program fails to handle the case where `x == y` and `z > 0` correctly for all possible scenarios. 

Given these considerations, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
