To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze the logic in relation to the problem description and the possible input cases.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The output should be:
   - "+" if upvotes > downvotes for all possible scenarios with unknown votes.
   - "-" if downvotes > upvotes for all possible scenarios.
   - "0" if upvotes == downvotes for all possible scenarios.
   - "?" if there are multiple possible outcomes based on how unknown votes could distribute.

### Program Logic:
- The program calculates:
  - `min_upvotes = x`
  - `max_upvotes = x + z`
  - `min_downvotes = y`
  - `max_downvotes = y + z`
- Then it checks:
  - If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'` (definitely more downvotes).
  - If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'` (definitely more upvotes).
  - Otherwise, it prints `'?'` (results are uncertain).

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Example with only unknown votes** (e.g., `0 0 1`):
   - The program correctly identifies that there could be both upvotes and downvotes, leading to an uncertain result. It returns `?` as expected.
   
2. **Example where upvotes and downvotes are equal but with unknown votes** (e.g., `1 1 0`):
   - The case is handled as it should print `0` since both are equal without any unknown influence altering this.

3. **Example with several votes that lead to uncertainty** (e.g., `1 0 1`):
   - The program would show that the result could be either `+` or `-`, thus should return `?`.

4. **Checking limits**: 
   - Inputs at the boundaries, such as `100 100 0`, should yield `0` since both are equal.

### Conclusion:
The code handles all potential cases described, and there doesnâ€™t seem to be any input where it would fail to meet the requirements of the problem. Each scenario results in a correct output based on the logic implemented.

Thus, based on the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
