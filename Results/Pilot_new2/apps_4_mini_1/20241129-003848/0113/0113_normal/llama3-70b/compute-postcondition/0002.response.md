According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and its relationship with `x`. The loop will execute as long as `n % x` is not equal to 0. 

Currently, `x` is equal to `10`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must not be a multiple of `10`. If `n` is any positive integer that is not a multiple of `10`, then `n % 10` will not equal `0`, and the loop can proceed.

Since `n` is defined as an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, it can take on values that may or may not be multiples of `10`. Thus, we need to ensure that `n` is not a multiple of `10` for the loop to execute at least once.

To summarize, for the loop to execute one time, we need to adjust the state so that `n` is not a multiple of `10`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` must not be a multiple of 10**
