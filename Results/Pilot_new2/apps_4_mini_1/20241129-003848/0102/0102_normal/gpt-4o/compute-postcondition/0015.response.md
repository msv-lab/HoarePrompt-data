The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99. After executing the function body, if `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the English word representation of `n` from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string for `n` by accessing the `teens` list at the index `n - 10`. If `n` is a multiple of 10 and in the range of 10 to 99, the function returns the string representation of the tens place for `n` based on the `tens` list. If `n` is in the range of 10 to 99 and is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format of tens and ones, where `tens[n // 10]` provides the ten's place word and `ones[n % 10]` provides the one's place word. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return its English word representation based on various conditions related to the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns its English word representation based on the value of n: if n is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding word from the ones list; if n is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from the teens list; if n is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, it returns the corresponding word from the tens list; otherwise, it returns a combination of the tens and ones word representations.**
