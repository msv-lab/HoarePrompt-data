To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program logic.

### Problem Requirements:
- The program needs to convert an integer score (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) into its English word representation.
- The output must consist only of lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'), with no spaces.

### Provided Program Logic:
1. **Ones**: The program correctly lists the English words for numbers 0 through 9 in the `ones` list.
2. **Teens**: The program includes a `teens` list for numbers 11 through 19, but it correctly accounts for the fact that 10 is in the `tens` list.
3. **Tens**: The program has a `tens` list for the multiples of ten from 10 to 90.
4. **Logic Flow**:
   - For numbers 0 to 9, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
   - For numbers 11 to 19, it returns the word from the `teens` list.
   - For numbers from 10 to 99:
     - If the number is a multiple of ten (like 10, 20, ..., 90), it returns the word from the `tens` list.
     - If the number is not a multiple of ten, it combines the appropriate tens and ones with a hyphen.

### Missing Case Check:
- The program does not handle the number **10** explicitly in the `teens`/`tens` logic. When `n` is 10, it falls into the `elif 10 <= n <= 99:` block, but since it checks for `n % 10 == 0` and returns `tens[n // 10]`, it correctly outputs "ten". Thus, this is handled correctly.
- The program also does not handle the number **11** correctly. The `teens` list starts with an empty string for 10, so when `n` is 11, it accesses `teens[1]`, which is "eleven". This is also handled correctly.
- However, the program does not account for the case where `n` is 10, and since it returns "ten", it is handled in the tens logic.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly returns words for all numbers within the specified range (0 to 99) as per the mapping provided.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and considering all possible edge cases, the program seems to effectively handle the input specifications of converting an integer score to its corresponding English words as required by the problem statement.

Since I could not find any potential case where the program fails to do what the description says, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**
