Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its English word representation while adhering to the specified format (using lowercase letters and hyphens). 

- For scores from 0 to 9, it directly retrieves the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
- For scores from 10 to 19, it retrieves the corresponding word from the `teens` list.
- For scores from 20 to 99, it constructs the word using the `tens` list for the tens place and, if the units place is non-zero, concatenates the word from the `ones` list with a hyphen in between.

This covers all potential cases within the specified range (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) as outlined in the problem description.
