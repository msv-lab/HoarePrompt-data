Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it is incorrect:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - The `func_1` function computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all integers in `lst[1:]`. While the gcd is a relevant concept, the problem requires determining the maximum possible positive integer that can divide all elements of `A` after performing up to `K` operations. Simply calculating the gcd of the initial array does not account for the allowed adjustments through the specified operations. 

2. **Functionality of `func_2`:**
   - The `func_2` function calculates and returns all divisors of the first element of `x` (which is `N`). This is incorrect because the problem requires finding the maximum integer that can divide all elements of an array after performing specific operations. The function doesn't address how the operations affect the values in the array or how to determine the maximum divisor that can be obtained after these operations.

3. **Lack of Operations Handling:**
   - The critical part of the problem is to handle the operations that allow the adjustment of values in the array. The program does not implement any logic that simulates or accounts for these operations (adding 1 to one element and subtracting 1 from another) to explore the effect on divisibility across all integers in the resulting array.

4. **Divisibility Check:**
   - The problem description requires finding the maximum integer that divides all elements of the modified array after the allowed operations. The program does not perform any checks or calculations to show how these modifications can lead to a common divisor.

In summary, the program fails to implement the core logic required by the problem description, notably the effects of the allowed operations on the integer array and how to derive the maximum divisor from that modified state. Therefore, the assessment yields **False** for correctness.
