The code snippet `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to the `divisors` set. Assuming `divisors` is defined and initialized as an empty set or with other values prior to this line, the only change is the addition of the value 2 to the set.

The previous state doesn't affect the values of `x`, `K`, or `A`, and since no specific values for `divisors` were provided in the initial state, we simply note the addition of `i` to it.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N positive integers A (1 <= A_i <= 10^6); `i` is 2, and `divisors` now includes the value 2.**
