Given the initial state where `x` is a tuple containing a positive integer `N`, a non-negative integer `K`, and a list of `N` positive integers `A`, and knowing that `i` is incremented by 1, the line of code being executed is `divisors.add(i)`.

1. The operation `i += 1` means that the value of `i` is increased by 1. As the initial value of `i` is not given, we can just state that `i` is now incremented.
2. The line `divisors.add(i)` adds the new value of `i` to the `divisors` set. This operation does not affect the other elements of `x`.

Since `N`, `K`, and the list `A` remain unchanged and only `i` is affected (incremented), the output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer `N`, the second element is a non-negative integer `K`, the third element is a list of `N` positive integers `A`; `i` is incremented by 1; `divisors` now includes the new value of `i`.**
