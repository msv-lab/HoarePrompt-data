To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided information step by step. 

1. The tuple `x` contains three elements: 
   - The first element is a positive integer `N` (with the condition \(2 \leq N \leq 500\)).
   - The second element is a non-negative integer `K` (with the condition \(0 \leq K \leq 10^9\)).
   - The third element is a list `A` containing `N` positive integers (with the condition \(1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6\) for each element \(A_i\)).

2. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. Here, `x` is a tuple, so we need to clarify that the loop should be using the first element of the tuple `x[0]`, which is `N`, instead of the entire tuple.

3. Therefore, the loop should be:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(N)) + 1):
   ```

4. For the loop to execute, `N` must be at least 1 (which it is since \(N \geq 2\)). Given \(N\) is a positive integer, taking the square root will yield a value greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to approximately 22 (since \(N\) can go up to 500).

5. The loop variable `i` will start from 1, which is the first value in the range.

In summary, the state needs clarification regarding the value derived from `N` to confirm the loop will execute. The state of `i` at the start of the loop is initialized to 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop executes is as follows:

State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N positive integers A (1 <= A_i <= 10^6), `divisors` is an empty set, and `i` is 1**
