Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N positive integers A (1 <= A_i <= 10^6). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` includes the value of `x`, and `i` is 1.***
