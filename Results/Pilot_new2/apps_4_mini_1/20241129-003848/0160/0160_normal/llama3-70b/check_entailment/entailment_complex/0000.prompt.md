You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
8 20

-----Sample Output-----
7

7 will divide every element of A if, for example, we perform the following operation:
 - Choose i = 2, j = 1. A becomes (7, 21).
We cannot reach the situation where 8 or greater integer divides every element of A.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500, A is a list of N integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, and K is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9.
def func():
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    gcd = A[0]
    for i in range(1, N):
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, A[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `i` is `N-1`
    max_divisor = gcd
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1):
        if gcd % i == 0:
            max_divisor = max(max_divisor, i)
            if i * i != gcd:
                max_divisor = max(max_divisor, gcd // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9; `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `gcd` is greater than or equal to 0; `max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd`; `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` after all iterations.
    print(max_divisor)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` (between 2 and 500), a list `A` of `N` integers (each between 1 and 10^6), and a non-negative integer `K` (less than or equal to 10^9). It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the integers in the list `A`, determines the largest divisor of this gcd, and prints this value. Note that `K` is accepted but not used in any computation or condition within the function.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
