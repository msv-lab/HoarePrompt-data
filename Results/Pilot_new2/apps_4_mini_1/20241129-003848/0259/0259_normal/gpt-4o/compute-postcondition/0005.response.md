The code `wait_time = s_i - t` calculates the wait time by subtracting the value of `t` from `s_i`. The initial state indicates that `s_i` (the first element of `bus_routes[0]`) is greater than or equal to `t`, which means that the result of `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer. 

Since `wait_time` is assigned a new value based on the current values of `s_i` and `t`, and other variables are not directly affected, the output state will reflect the updated value of `wait_time`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, the current value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.**
