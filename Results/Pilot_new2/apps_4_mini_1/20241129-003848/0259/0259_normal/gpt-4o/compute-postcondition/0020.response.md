The `wait_time` is assigned the value of `0`. The other variables `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. The new value for `i` will be `i + 1`, and `s_i` and `d_i` will take values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5; `i` is now `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`; `min_wait_time` remains unchanged; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `wait_time` is 0.**
