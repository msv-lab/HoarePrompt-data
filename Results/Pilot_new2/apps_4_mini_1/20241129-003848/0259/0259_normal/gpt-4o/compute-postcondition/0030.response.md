The code snippet initializes the variable `wait_time` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is the next index which is less than `n`; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `d_i` is the second element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `wait_time` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is the next index which is less than `n`; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `d_i` is the second element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `wait_time` is 0.**
