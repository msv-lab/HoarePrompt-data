The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The variable `i` is the next index which is less than `n`, meaning `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n`. Therefore, `chosen_route` will be a positive integer ranging from 1 to `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is the next index which is less than `n`; `chosen_route` is `i + 1`; `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `d_i` is the second element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
