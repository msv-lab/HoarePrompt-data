The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]` and `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, we can calculate `wait_time` using the current values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; `i` is 0; `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`; `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`; `s_i` is less than `t`; `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; `i` is 0; `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`; `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`; `s_i` is less than `t`; `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.**
