The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers \((s_i, d_i)\) such that \(1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 10^5\).

After executing the function body, it returns the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time. If no suitable route is found, the function returns -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, and return the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, or -1 if no suitable route exists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, t, and bus_routes, returning the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, or -1 if no suitable route is found.**
