The line of code `s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]` assigns the values from the tuple located at index `i` of the `bus_routes` list to the variables `s_i` and `d_i`. Since `i` is less than `n`, this operation is valid and will yield the respective elements of the tuple at that index. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is the next index which is less than `n`; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `d_i` is the second element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`.**
