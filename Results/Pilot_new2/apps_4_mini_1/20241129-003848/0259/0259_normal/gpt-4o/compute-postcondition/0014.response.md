The code assigns the current value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. The value of `min_wait_time` now equals `wait_time`. Since `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time` before this assignment, this implies that the original value of `min_wait_time` is greater than the original value of `wait_time`, but after the assignment, they become equal.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5; `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, and now `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5; `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, and now `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
