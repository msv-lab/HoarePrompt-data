According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is an integer within the range `1 <= n <= 100`. The variable `t` is a positive integer within the range `1 <= t <= 100000`, which does not affect the execution of the loop directly. The `buses` list is empty but since it is not used in the loop condition, it does not influence the loop's execution either.

Given that `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. The loop variable `_` does not hold any value relevant for us after the loop iterates, but it will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. 

Therefore, to summarize the states before the loop starts:

State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, and `_` can be considered as 0, the initial iteration index.**
