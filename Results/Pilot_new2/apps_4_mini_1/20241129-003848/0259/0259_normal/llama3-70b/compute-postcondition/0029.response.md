Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, and `i` is 2. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `ans` is updated to 3 and `min_time` is set to `(t - buses[i][0]) % buses[i][1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2.***
