Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, and `min_time` remains `float('inf')`. If `time`, calculated as `(t - s) % d`, is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the current value of `time`, `ans` is set to 1, and `i` is 0.***
