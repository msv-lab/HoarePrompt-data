Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, `min_time` is the minimum time calculated as `(t - s) % d` for the buses that provided the minimum value, `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus that resulted in `min_time`, or remains -1 if no update occurred.**
