The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the results of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts a line of input and splits it into two parts, converting each to an integer. The initial values of `n`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `_` can be considered as 0, and `s` and `d` are inputs that have been converted to integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `_` can be considered as 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.**
