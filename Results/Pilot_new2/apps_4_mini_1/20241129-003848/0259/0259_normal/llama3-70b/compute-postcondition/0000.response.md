The values of `n` and `t` are assigned the output of `map(int, input().split())`, which takes two space-separated integer inputs. The previous state of `n` and `t` will be overwritten with these values, but the ranges for `n` and `t` remain valid as they still satisfy the conditions provided in the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, and now `n` and `t` have values assigned from input.**
