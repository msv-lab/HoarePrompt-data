The variable `ans` is assigned the value `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 1, so `ans` becomes 1 + 1 = 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, `min_time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`, `i` is 1, `time` is assigned the value `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is 2.**
