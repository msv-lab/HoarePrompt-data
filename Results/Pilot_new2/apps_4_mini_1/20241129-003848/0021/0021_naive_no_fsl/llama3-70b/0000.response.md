To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step based on the problem description.

1. **Understanding the problem**: The goal is to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of numbers from 1 to n after performing exactly one swap.

2. **Input and output**: The input consists of an integer n followed by a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n. The output should be the maximum possible distance between 1 and n after the swap.

3. **Key variables**:
   - `pos1` gets the index of the minimum element (1).
   - `posn` gets the index of the maximum element (n).
   - The program calculates `max_dist` based on the current positions and `min_dist` in a rather convoluted way.

4. **Critical logic checks**:
   - The distance between two indices is simply the absolute difference between them.
   - The program attempts to determine `max_dist` and `min_dist` using `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. This logic does not accurately represent the requirement to maximize the distance after a swap.
   - The calculation of `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)` seems incorrect as `min_dist` is not correctly defined in relation to what the problem wants.

5. **Potential test case**: Consider a simple case where `n = 2`. The input `2\n2 1` would place 1 and 2 at the two positions. The maximum distance should be 1 (since they are already at opposite ends). However, the way the program is structured may not yield the correct output since it miscalculates the distances based on a flawed approach.

6. **Additional test cases**:
   - For `n = 3`, input `3\n1 2 3` should yield a distance of 2 by swapping 2 and 3, but the program may return an incorrect value based on its flawed logic.

In conclusion, the program contains logical mistakes and does not consistently produce the correct results as described in the problem statement. 

Correctness: **False**
