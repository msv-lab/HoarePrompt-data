To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we analyze the code snippet with respect to the initial state defined. 

1. The `max_dist` and `min_dist` calculations involve the indices of the values `1` and `n` in the list `a`. Assuming `pos1` is the index of `1` and `posn` is the index of `n`, the values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` are already computed based on these positions.
   
2. The code calls `print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))`. This expression calculates the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

3. The value printed to the console does not change the values of the variables in the initial state, but it outputs a calculated result based on current values.

Thus, the output state retains all the original variables while reflecting the result from the computation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the user-provided input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers input by the user in the range from 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of the value n in the list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is equal to min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); and the result printed is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist).**
