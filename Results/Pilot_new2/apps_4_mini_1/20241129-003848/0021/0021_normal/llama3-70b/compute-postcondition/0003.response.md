The code assigns the variable `posn` the value of the index of the integer `n` within the list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`, `n` must be one of those integers, and thus it will have a valid index in `a`. The previous values of other variables, including `n`, `a`, and `pos1`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the user-provided input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers input by the user in the range from 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of the value `n` in the list `a`.**
