The variable `max_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The initial conditions state that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. Since `n` is guaranteed to be in the list `a` (as it contains distinct integers), `max_pos` will be the index where `n` appears for the first time.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
