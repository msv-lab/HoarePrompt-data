The value of `dist3` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - min_pos)`, which calculates the absolute distance from index 0 to the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`. The value of `min_pos` is previously determined and remains unchanged after this assignment. The other values of `n`, `a`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, and `dist2` are not modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`.**
