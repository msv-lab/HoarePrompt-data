To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic.

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
min_pos = a.index(1)
max_pos = a.index(n)
dist1 = abs(0 - max_pos)
dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)
dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)
dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)
max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)
print(max_distance)
```

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires finding the maximum possible distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in an array after performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their indices.

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Finding Positions**: The code correctly identifies the positions of the minimum (`1`) and maximum (`n`) elements.
2. **Calculating Distances**: It calculates four potential distances:
   - Distance of `1` from the start (index `0`) and `n` from the maximum position.
   - Distance of `n` from the end (index `n-1`) and `1` from the minimum position.
3. **Maximum of Distances**: Finally, it finds the maximum distance.

### Issues with the Code
While the approach seems correct at first glance, there is an issue in the logic of maximizing the distance after one swap:
- The swaps to consider should be specifically between the elements `1` and `n` to places at the extreme ends of the array (positions `0` and `n-1`).
- The method by which distances are calculated does not account for the necessary swapâ€”it simply computes absolute distances without ensuring that a swap takes place.

### Counterexample
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- Here, `1` is at index `0` and `5` is at index `4`. The maximum distance without any swaps would be `4`, and a swap (which is not accounted for in the code) might yield a maximum distance of `4` if they were to swap and remain at the edges.
- However, the program would output `4`, which does not follow the swap requirement.

### Conclusion
Since the program fails in scenarios where it does not account for the necessary swap and calculation of maximum distance based on actual swaps, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
