Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `apartment`, representing an apartment number, and returns a tuple containing two values: the block number and the floor number associated with that apartment. The block is calculated based on the total number of apartments per block (determined by parameters `m` and `k`), and the floor is derived from the position of the apartment within that block. The function assumes valid input within the specified ranges but does not handle input validation or cases where the apartment number exceeds the total number of apartments in the building. **
