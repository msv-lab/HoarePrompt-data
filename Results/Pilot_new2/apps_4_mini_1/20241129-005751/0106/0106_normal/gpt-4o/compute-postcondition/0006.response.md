Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are updated with values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are updated with values from `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is equal to `10 + (floor_a - 1)`.***
