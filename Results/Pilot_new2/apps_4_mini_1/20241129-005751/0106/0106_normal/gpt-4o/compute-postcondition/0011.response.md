The variable `total_time` is assigned the value of `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`. The value of `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, and `min_walk_time` is defined as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `block_a` remains unchanged, `floor_a` remains unchanged, `block_b` remains unchanged, `floor_b` remains unchanged, `time_to_exit` remains unchanged, `direct_walk_time` remains unchanged, `reverse_walk_time` remains unchanged, `min_walk_time` is defined as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is equal to `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, and `total_time` is equal to `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + (floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
