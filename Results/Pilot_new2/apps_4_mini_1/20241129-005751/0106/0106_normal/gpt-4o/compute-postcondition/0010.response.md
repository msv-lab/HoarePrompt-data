The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The other variables retain their previous values, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. The value of `time_to_target_floor` depends on the value of `floor_b`. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `time_to_target_floor`.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `block_a` remains unchanged, `floor_a` remains unchanged, `block_b` remains unchanged, `floor_b` remains unchanged, `time_to_exit` remains unchanged, `direct_walk_time` remains unchanged, `reverse_walk_time` remains unchanged, `min_walk_time` is defined as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is equal to `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
