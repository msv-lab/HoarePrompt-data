The variable `b_floor` is assigned the value `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The calculation for `b_floor` uses the value of `b`, which is an integer where `1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k`, and `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 1000`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, and `a_block` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers assigned from input values where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`.**
