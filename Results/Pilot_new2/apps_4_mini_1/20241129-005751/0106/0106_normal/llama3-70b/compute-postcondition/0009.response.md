Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers assigned from input values where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_block_time` is equal to min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; and `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`.***
