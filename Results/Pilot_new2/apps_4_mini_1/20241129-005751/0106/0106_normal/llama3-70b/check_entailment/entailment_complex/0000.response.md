To determine the correctness of the proposed program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately calculates the minimum time for Edward to travel from his apartment to Natasha's, adhering to the rules and constraints outlined in the problem description.

### Key Elements from the Problem Description:
1. **Building Structure**: The building consists of `n` entrances (blocks), each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments.
2. **Apartment Numbering**: Apartments are numbered sequentially, with the first apartment on the first floor of the first entrance numbered as 1.
3. **Travel Time**:
   - Moving between floors takes 5 seconds.
   - Moving between entrances takes 15 seconds.
   - The lift takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor movement.
4. **Edward's Movement**: Edward can use the lift to reach the first floor, which includes the waiting time for the lift.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Floor Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the floor (`a_floor`, `b_floor`) and block/entrance (`a_block`, `b_block`) of each apartment using correct mathematical operations.
3. **Block Movement Time**: 
   - The program calculates the minimum time required to move between blocks considering both clockwise and counterclockwise movement, which is correct as per the problem's circular structure.
4. **Floor Movement Time**:
   - The program calculates the time taken to move between floors based on whether Edward needs to go up or down. However, it does not account for the lift as described in the problem. The lift should be considered since it is a viable option to reach the first floor from the current floor.

### Issue Identified:
The main issue with the program is that it does not incorporate the option of using the lift to minimize the transition from Edward's starting floor to the first floor. The program only calculates the time needed to walk down or up the stairs, which does not reflect the potential quicker option using the lift.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to consider using the lift for going down to the first floor, it does not compute the correct minimum time in all scenarios as described in the problem statement. 

Thus, the correctness assessment is:
Correctness: **False** 

This is because there are scenarios (especially when starting from floors above the first) where the lift would provide a faster route to the first floor than simply using the stairs, and the program does not account for this in its calculations.
