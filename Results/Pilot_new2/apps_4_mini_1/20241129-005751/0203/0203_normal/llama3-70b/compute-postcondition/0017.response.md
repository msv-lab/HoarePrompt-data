Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `fraction` is the second character in the string. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1, and `remocrats` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the first character is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1, or if the first character is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1.***
