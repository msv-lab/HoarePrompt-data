The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The string length condition is still valid since `n` must remain a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000)**
