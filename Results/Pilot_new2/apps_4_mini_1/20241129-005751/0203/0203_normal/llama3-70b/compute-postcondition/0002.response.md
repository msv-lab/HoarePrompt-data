The variable `depublicans` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is initialized. The other variables, `n` and `fractions`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialized value of `depublicans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0**.
