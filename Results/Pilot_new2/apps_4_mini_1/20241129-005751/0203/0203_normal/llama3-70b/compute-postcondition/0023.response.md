Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', and the length of `fractions` is equal to `n`. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, then 'D' has been printed; otherwise, 'D' has not been printed.***
