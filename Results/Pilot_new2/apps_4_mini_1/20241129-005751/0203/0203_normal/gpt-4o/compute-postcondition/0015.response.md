The code appends the current value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The value of `i` has been updated to `i + 1`, but we do not have the previous value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is now `i + 1`; `d_queue` now includes the value of `i` appended to it.**
