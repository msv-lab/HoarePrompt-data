The variable `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, which is obtained by popping that element from the queue. Since `r_queue` must not be empty, it has at least one element, so `r_index` will hold the value of that first element. The variable `r_queue` will now have one less element than before. The states of the other variables are not affected; hence the output state reflects the new value of `r_index` and the decreased size of `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element than before, `r_queue` has one less element than before and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.**
