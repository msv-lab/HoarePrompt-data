Postcondition: ***`d_queue` contains its previous elements plus the value of `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` contains at least one less index, `d_index` remains the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, while `r_queue` now contains one additional element which is `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`.***
