The code snippet `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` changes the state of the variable `d_index` by assigning it the first element of `d_queue`, which is then removed from `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` must not be empty, the operation is valid and results in one less element in `d_queue`. The variable `r_queue` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element than before, `r_queue` must not be empty, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`.**
