The code appends the current value of `i` to the `r_queue` list. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. We know that `i` has been incremented by 1, so the current value of `i` is now `i + 1`. Since `r_queue` is being updated, we don't know its previous contents, but it will now include the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is now `i + 1`; `r_queue` now includes the value `i + 1`.**
