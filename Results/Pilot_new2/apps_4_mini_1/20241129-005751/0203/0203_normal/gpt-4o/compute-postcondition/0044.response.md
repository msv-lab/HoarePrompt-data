Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is not empty, the final state of `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last values removed from their respective queues, and the output will be 'D'. If `d_queue` is empty, then either `d_queue` or `r_queue` is empty, and the final state of `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last values removed from `r_queue`, as `d_queue` was not accessed. In both cases, `d_queue` and `r_queue` may contain re-added indices based on their relationships with each other.***
