To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of the code closely.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:

1. We need to find the minimum number of variables `m` such that we can perform a series of operations based on a given sequence of distinct positive integers.
2. The first operation initializes a variable with the first element of the sequence.
3. Subsequent operations involve assigning values based on the sum of existing variables, and we need to ensure that we can form each required value in the sequence.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:

The code defines a function `func_1(n, a)` which:
- Sorts the array `a`.
- Initializes a set `assigned` to keep track of values that can be formed.
- Starts with the first element and iteratively checks if subsequent elements can be formed by summing any two previously assigned values.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Sequence**: The code only checks if the current value can be formed by summing any two previous values, but it fails to account for the combination of variables correctly. As a result, it may prematurely increase `m` when it shouldn't.
  
2. **Missing Edge Case**: The problem states that if itâ€™s not possible to perform the sequence of operations with any `m`, the program should return -1. The current implementation does not handle all possible configurations that could lead to an invalid scenario.

### Potential Counterexamples:

1. **Counterexample Test**: For input `(3, [3, 6, 5])`, the expected output is -1, as it's impossible to form `5` using `3` and `6`. The function may miscount `m` incorrectly.

2. **Another Counterexample**: Consider input `1, [1]`. The program should ideally return `1`, since we can just use one variable, but the entire logic of how it checks for combinations may lead to incorrect counting.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis and the identification of potential edge cases where the program does not adhere to the problem requirements, I conclude that the program does not work as expected in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
