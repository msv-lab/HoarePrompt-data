The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, so the output state only updates the value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True**.
