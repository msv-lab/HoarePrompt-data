The value of `can_form` is explicitly set to `True`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, and at least one more element, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the fourth element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is now True.
