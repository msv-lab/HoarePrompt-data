According to the code, for the loop to execute again, it needs to iterate over the `assigned` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n` (indicating that the loop has finished processing all elements of `assigned`), meaning that all elements have been traversed. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be set to the first element of `assigned` again, and the `assigned` list must have at least one more element for the loop to consider as `x`.

Since `assigned` includes at least the first three elements (which must be distinct positive integers) and since it has been stated that the last iteration has already processed all elements without breaking, we need to reflect that `x` is now at the starting point of the `assigned` list.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `assigned`.**
