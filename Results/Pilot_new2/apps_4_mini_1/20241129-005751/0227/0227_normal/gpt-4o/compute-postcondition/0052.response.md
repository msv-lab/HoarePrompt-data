The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables remain unaffected, and their states stay the same as before the execution of the code. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True.**
