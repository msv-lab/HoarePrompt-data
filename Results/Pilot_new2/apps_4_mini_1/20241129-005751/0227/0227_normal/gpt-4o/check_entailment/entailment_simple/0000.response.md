The provided Python program is tasked with determining the minimum number of variables required to perform a series of operations based on a given sequence of distinct positive integers. Let's evaluate the correctness of the program against the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Sorting the Input**: The program first sorts the input list `a`. This helps in trying to form the required sums from the smallest to the largest.

2. **Tracking Assigned Values**: The program uses a set called `assigned` which stores the values that can currently be formed using the variables. It starts by assigning the first value `a[0]` to the first variable.

3. **Main Loop**: The program then iterates through the rest of the values in list `a`. For each value `a[i]`, it checks if it can be formed by adding two values from the `assigned` set (i.e., looking for pairs that sum to `a[i]`).

4. **Counting Variables**: If no such pair is found that can form `a[i]`, it increments the variable count `m`, indicating that an additional variable is needed.

5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, it returns the value of `m`.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Correct Calculation of `m`**: The logic correctly tries to form each subsequent value in the list by checking if it can be derived from previously assigned values (stored in the set). If a value cannot be formed, it correctly counts that an additional variable is needed.

- **Handling Cases Appropriately**: The program sorts the values and iteratively checks the potential sums, which aligns with the problem's requirement of determining the minimum number of variables needed.

- **Edge Cases**: The problem states that if it is impossible to achieve the operations with any number of variables, the output should be `-1`. However, the program does not explicitly handle the scenario where it might be impossible to form the required sums. For instance, if the sequence has values such as `3, 6, 5`, it might not correctly determine that more variables are needed (or that it is impossible) because it doesn't check combinations exhaustively.

### Conclusion:

The program does not account for the possibility of returning `-1` when no valid configuration of variables can achieve the required sums. As a result, it may give incorrect results in scenarios where it cannot form certain required sums with the available variables. 

Thus, based on the analysis, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
