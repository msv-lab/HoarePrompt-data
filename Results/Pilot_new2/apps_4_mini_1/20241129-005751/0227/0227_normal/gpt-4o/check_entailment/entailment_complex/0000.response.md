Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic specified in the problem description. The main issues are as follows:

1. **Logic of Variable Assignment**: The problem requires that for each subsequent operation after the first, we must assign a value equal to the sum of two previously assigned variables. The program instead checks if the difference between the current number and any previously assigned number can be formed using the existing assigned numbers. This is not aligned with the requirement to sum two variables to produce the next value.

2. **Formation of Subsequent Values**: The problem specifies that for each operation, the value assigned must be equal to `a[i]`, and this must be done by summing the values of two previously assigned variables. The program does not ensure that the values can actually be reached by summing existing assigned values. It merely checks if a difference can be formed, which is not the same as needing to create the next number through addition.

3. **Correctness Check for Impossible Cases**: The problem states that if it is impossible to perform the sequence of operations with any number of variables, the output should be -1. The program does not handle or check for scenarios where it's impossible to form the required sums properly.

In summary, the program does not follow the problem description because it is focused on checking for differences rather than sums and does not properly account for the required operations. Hence, it does not correctly determine the minimum number of variables needed or whether the operations can be performed.
