To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation:

The problem requires us to check if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that for no pair `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`, the condition `n mod i = n mod j` holds true.

The implementation reads two integers, `n` and `k`, and then uses a set to track the remainders:

1. It iterates over the range from `1` to `k` inclusive.
2. For each integer `i`, it calculates `n % i` (the remainder when `n` is divided by `i`).
3. It checks if this remainder has already been seen (i.e., if it is already in the `seen` set).
4. If a duplicate is found, the program outputs "No" and exits immediately.
5. If all remainders are distinct, it outputs "Yes" at the end.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- When `k` is `1`, `n % 1` will always be `0` for any `n`, so the output should be "Yes".
- When `n` is less than `k`, there are certain values of `i` (specifically `i` values greater than `n`) where `n % i` will equal `n` because the divisor `i` is larger than `n`. This means that for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, all remainders will be distinct, but for `i > n`, the remainder will be `n` and could cause duplication.

For example, if we have `n = 5` and `k = 7`, the remainders would be:
- `5 % 1 = 0`
- `5 % 2 = 1`
- `5 % 3 = 2`
- `5 % 4 = 1` (duplicate here)
- `5 % 5 = 0` (duplicate here)
- `5 % 6 = 5`
- `5 % 7 = 5`

Thus, in this case, since `k` exceeds `n`, duplicates arise in the remainders. The program does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect output.

Therefore, the implementation does not correctly handle this case.

Correctness: **False**.
