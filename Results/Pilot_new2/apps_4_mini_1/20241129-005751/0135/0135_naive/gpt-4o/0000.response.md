To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to check if all the remainders of `n` when divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i = n % j`.

### Given Program
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'
print(func_1(n, k))
```

### Code Breakdown
1. The program takes input values for `n` and `k`.
2. It checks if `k >= n`. If true, it immediately returns `'No'`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `n % n` equals `0`, and `n % 1` also equals `0`, hence the remainders cannot all be distinct.
3. It initializes an empty set called `seen_remainders`.
4. It iterates through all integers `i` from `1` to `k`, calculates `remainder = n % i`, and checks if this remainder has already been seen.
5. If a remainder is found in `seen_remainders`, it returns `'No'`.
6. If no duplicates are found, it returns `'Yes'`.

### Edge Case Analysis
Let's consider potential edge cases:
1. **Case when `k < n`**: The program should handle this appropriately, which it does.
2. **Case when `k = 1`**: The only remainder is `n % 1`, which is always `0`. This is correctly handled by the `k >= n` check.
3. **Case when `n` and `k` are equal**: For example, `(5, 5)`, the remainders will be `0 (5%1), 1 (5%2), 2 (5%3), 3 (5%4), 0 (5%5)`; it should return `'No'`. This is also correctly handled by the `k >= n` check.
4. **Maximal edge cases (`n` and `k` at the limit of `10^18`)**: The program will still function correctly since Python handles large integers well. 

### Finding Counterexamples
While analyzing, I cannot find a scenario where the provided code fails to meet the problem's requirements:
- The logic checks for duplicates effectively.
- The early return for `k >= n` is valid and prevents unnecessary calculations.

### Conclusion
Since the code appears to handle all specified cases correctly and no counterexamples exist, we conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**.
