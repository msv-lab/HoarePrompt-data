Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that k is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is in `seen`, then 'No' has been printed. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `remainder` not in `seen`.***
