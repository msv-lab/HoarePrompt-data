The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. As a result, no further code will execute, and the state of the variables will not change. The previously printed statement "No" remains valid, but the execution of the program is halted.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer such that k is greater than or equal to 1; `seen` is an empty set; `i` is 1; `remainder` is 0; and 'No' has been printed.**
