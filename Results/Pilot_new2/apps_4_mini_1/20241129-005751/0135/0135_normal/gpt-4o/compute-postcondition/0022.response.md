The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). The function has multiple return cases based on the relationship between `n` and `k`, as well as the detection of cycles in the process. 

In detail:
- In Case 1, the function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- In Case 2, the function returns 'No' if a cycle has been detected, indicated by the current value of 'remainder' being in 'seen_remainders'.
- In Case 3, the function returns 'No' if the conditions for a positive answer based on `n`, `k`, 'seen_remainders', and 'remainder' are not satisfied.
- In Case 4, the function returns 'No' regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, 'seen_remainders', `i`, and 'remainder'.
- In Case 5, the function returns 'Yes' if the conditions associated with unique remainders from the executions of `n % i` for `i` in the range from `1` to `k` have been satisfied.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, and return responses based on their values and certain computational conditions, which can either be 'Yes' or 'No'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, returns 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n, if a cycle is detected, if conditions for a positive answer are not met, or returns 'Yes' if the condition with unique remainders is satisfied.**
