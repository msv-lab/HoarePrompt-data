The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the results of counting the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the string `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` is an input string, but does not define its specific content. Therefore, the output will specify that `cnt0` and `cnt1` are respectively the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**.
