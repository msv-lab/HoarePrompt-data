`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `T` must adhere to the constraint of being a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`**
