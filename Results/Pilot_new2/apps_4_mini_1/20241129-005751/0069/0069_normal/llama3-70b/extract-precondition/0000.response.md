Precondition: **T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, x is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, and s is a binary string of length n where each character is either '0' or '1'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
