The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It counts the occurrences of '0's and '1's in `s`, computes a balance as the difference between these counts, and determines specific outputs based on the relationship between `balance` and `x`. If `balance` equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between the counts of '0' and '1', it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the formula `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. However, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the division is undefined and may lead to no output for some cases.
