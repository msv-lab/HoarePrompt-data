Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`. If `balance` is 0, then if `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1 appended to it; otherwise, `results` is updated to include 0. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` are as per the last execution with `count` now appended to it, where `count` is the total number of valid `b` values that satisfy `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the string value from `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is updated to `index + 3.`***
