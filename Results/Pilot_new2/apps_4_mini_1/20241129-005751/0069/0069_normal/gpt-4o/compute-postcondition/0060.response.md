Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance` (the cumulative balance derived from `s`), `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and the value of `balance` is not equal to 0.***
