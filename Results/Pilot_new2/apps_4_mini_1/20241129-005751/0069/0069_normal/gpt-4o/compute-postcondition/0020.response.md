Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the balance of '0's minus '1's from the first `i` characters of the string `s`, the current value of `balance` is 0, and the value `x` is present in the list `prefix_balances`.***
