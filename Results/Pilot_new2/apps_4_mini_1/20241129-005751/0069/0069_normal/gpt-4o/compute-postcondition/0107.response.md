Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')` and not equal to 0, `results` are as per the last execution, `count` is the total number of valid `b` values that satisfy `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the string value from `data[index + 2]`, `index` is updated to `index + 3`, and `b` is the last element of `prefix_balances` processed in the loop. If there are no valid `b` values, `count` will remain 0.**
