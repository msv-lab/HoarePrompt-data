The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100) derived from `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input data, and `index` is 1.
