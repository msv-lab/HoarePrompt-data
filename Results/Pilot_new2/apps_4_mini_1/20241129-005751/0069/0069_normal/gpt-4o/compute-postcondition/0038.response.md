The line of code `results.append(count)` appends the value of `count` to the list `results`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged in the output state.

Since `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, this value is preserved as is.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, `b` is the last element of `prefix_balances`, `results` includes the value of `count`.**
