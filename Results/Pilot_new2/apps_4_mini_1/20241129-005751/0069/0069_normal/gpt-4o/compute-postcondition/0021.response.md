The `results` list is updated by appending the value `-1` to it. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, the current value of `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in the list `prefix_balances`, and `results` now contains `-1`.
