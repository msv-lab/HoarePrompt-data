The function `func_1` accepts parameters `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. Here are the detailed descriptions of each parameter based on the provided constraints:

- `T` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 <= T <= 100).
- For each test case:
  - `n` is a positive integer indicating the length of the string `s` (1 <= n <= 10^5).
  - `x` is an integer that can range from -10^9 to 10^9.
  - `s` is a binary string of length `n`, consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

The functionality of the function is not explicitly described in the output provided. Therefore, without additional details on what the function does or returns based on the inputs, I cannot provide a complete description of the return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T, n, x, and s, where T is the number of test cases, n is the length of the binary string s, x is an integer, and s is a binary string. The specific return value is not defined in the provided output.**
