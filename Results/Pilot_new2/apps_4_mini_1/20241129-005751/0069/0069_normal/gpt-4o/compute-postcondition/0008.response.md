The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The initial value of `index` is 1, so this means `s` will be set to `data[3]`, which is the value at the 3rd position in the `data` list. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is []**
