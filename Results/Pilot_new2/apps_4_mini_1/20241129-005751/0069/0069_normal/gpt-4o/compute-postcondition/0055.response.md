Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance` (the cumulative balance derived from `s`), `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, the current value of `balance` is 0, and `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`.***
