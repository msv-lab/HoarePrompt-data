The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is the total number of shares acquired; if `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[i]`, and the list `s` remains a sorted list of integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2; if `shares` is not greater than 0, `r` remains the remaining amount after possible deductions.
