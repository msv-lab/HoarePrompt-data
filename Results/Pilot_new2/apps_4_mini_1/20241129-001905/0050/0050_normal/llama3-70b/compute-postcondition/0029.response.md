The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is less than or equal to 0, `r` is the remaining amount after possible deductions, `s` is a sorted list of integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
