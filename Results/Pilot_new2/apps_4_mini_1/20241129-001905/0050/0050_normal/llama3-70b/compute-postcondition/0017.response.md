Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding `r // s[i]` to its previous value, `i` is set to 1, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]` while ensuring that `r` is now less than `s[0]`. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `s[i]`, then `shares` remains 0, `i` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
