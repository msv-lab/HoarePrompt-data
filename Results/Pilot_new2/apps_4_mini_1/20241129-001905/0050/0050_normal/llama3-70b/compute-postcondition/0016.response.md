The code `break` indicates that we will exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this code, but we acknowledge that we are breaking out of a loop or conditional structure. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial conditions of the variables along with the action of breaking.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `shares` remains 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
