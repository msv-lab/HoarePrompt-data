The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on input, where each integer `s_i` is such that 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0, `r` is less than `s[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
