The variable `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. Given the preconditions, `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`. After executing the line of code, `total_bourles` will be the result of that calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30; `r` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `n` integers derived from input; `b` is a list of `m` integers derived from input where each element `b[j]` satisfies 1 <= `b[j]` <= 1000; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`; and `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price; total_bourles` is equal to `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.**
