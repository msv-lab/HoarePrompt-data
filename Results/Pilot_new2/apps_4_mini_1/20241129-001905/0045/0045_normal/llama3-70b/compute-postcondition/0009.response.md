Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The code correctly handles cases where `b` is zero, as it will return `a` (which would be the GCD if `b` is initially zero). Thus, the function will always return the GCD of the two input integers. **
