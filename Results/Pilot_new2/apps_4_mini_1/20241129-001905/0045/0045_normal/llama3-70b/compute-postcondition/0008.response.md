The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, where `a` represents the sum of a sequence and `b` represents the number of elements in that sequence. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return their GCD. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.**
