To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, I will analyze the provided code and the possible edge cases.

The problem requires generating a strictly increasing sequence of \( k \) positive integers that sum to \( n \) and have the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD).

Now, examining the code:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    seq = []
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if n >= i:
            seq.append(i)
            n -= i
        else:
            break
    if len(seq) != k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, seq)))
```

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Condition**: The code first checks if \( n < k \). If this condition is true, the function outputs `-1`, which makes sense because we cannot create \( k \) positive integers that sum to \( n \) if \( n \) is less than \( k \).
  
2. **Constructing the Sequence**: The code attempts to create a sequence of integers starting from `1` to `k`. It subtracts the integers from \( n \) as it constructs this sequence. However, this approach inherently leads to a sequence of \( [1, 2, 3, ..., k] \).

3. **Checking Sequence Length**: After constructing the sequence, it checks if the length of the sequence is \( k \). If not, it outputs `-1`.

### Edge Cases

The code does not handle the case when \( n \) is equal to the sum of the first \( k \) integers. Specifically, the sum of the first \( k \) integers is given by the formula:

\[
\text{sum} = \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}
\]

If \( n \) is equal to this sum, the code will work and produce the correct output. However, if \( n \) is greater than this sum, the code does not maximize the GCD.

For example, consider \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 2 \):
- The sequence generated would be \( [1, 2] \) summing to \( 3 \). This is incorrect.
- The correct output would be \( [2, 6] \).

Another example is when \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \):
- The smallest possible sum would be \( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \), so it correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion

The program fails to generate sequences with the maximum GCD when \( n \) is larger than the smallest \( k \) integers. It only checks the condition for \( n < k \) and uses a simple sequence from \( 1 \) to \( k \), which does not guarantee the maximum GCD.

Since there is at least one case (like \( n = 8, k = 2 \)) where the output is incorrect, we conclude that the program does not meet the problem's specification for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
