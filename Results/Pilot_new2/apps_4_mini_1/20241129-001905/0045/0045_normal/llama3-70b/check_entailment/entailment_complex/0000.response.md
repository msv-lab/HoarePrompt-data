Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program only calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` (which corresponds to `n`, the sum of the sequence) and `b` (which corresponds to `k`, the number of elements in the sequence). However, the problem description requires creating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sums up to `n` and has the maximal GCD.

The program does not address the following key requirements of the problem description:

1. **Sequence Generation**: The program does not generate a sequence of `k` positive integers. It simply calculates a GCD, which is unrelated to forming a specific sequence that meets the criteria.
  
2. **Strictly Increasing Condition**: There is no logic in the program to ensure that the generated sequence is strictly increasing.

3. **Summation Check**: The program does not validate whether the sum of the generated sequence equals `n`. 

4. **Handling Impossible Cases**: The program lacks logic to output `-1` when it is impossible to create such a sequence, which is part of the problem requirements.

In summary, the program fails to meet the problem description's requirements as it does not construct the required sequence, does not check for strict increasing order, does not ensure the sum equals `n`, and does not handle cases where it is impossible to form such a sequence.
