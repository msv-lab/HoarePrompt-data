The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` positive integers. If this sum exceeds `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the base value `d` such that the sequence will be of the form [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd] and distributes any remaining value (`remainder`) evenly across the sequence, incrementing the last elements as needed. Finally, it returns the constructed sequence.
