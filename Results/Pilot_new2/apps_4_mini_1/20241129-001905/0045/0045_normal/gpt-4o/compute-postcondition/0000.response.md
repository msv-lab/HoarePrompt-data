The value of `min_sum` is computed as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10`. The variable `min_sum` is now defined based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`.**
