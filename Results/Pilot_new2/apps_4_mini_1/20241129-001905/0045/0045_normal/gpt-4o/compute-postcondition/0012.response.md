Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min_sum - 1 \); `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd] \) and the last element has been incremented by 1; `i` is \( k - 1 \**
