Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two very long integers, handling leading zeros appropriately. Here's a breakdown of how it addresses various cases:

1. **Reading Input**: The program uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input efficiently, which is suitable given the problem's constraints on input size.

2. **Handling Leading Zeros**: It correctly strips leading zeros from both integers using `lstrip('0')`. After stripping, if the resulting string is empty, it assigns '0' to ensure that the comparison logic works correctly.

3. **Length Comparison**: The program first compares the lengths of the two strings. If one string is shorter, it is guaranteed to represent a smaller number (unless both are '0').

4. **Lexicographical Comparison**: If the lengths are equal, it compares the strings lexicographically, which is valid for comparing non-negative integers.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison results.

Given the implementation, it handles all edge cases specified in the problem description, including:
- Leading zeros in both numbers.
- The case where both numbers are zero after stripping leading zeros.

Since no examples can be found where the program fails to meet the problem requirements, the code is correct.
