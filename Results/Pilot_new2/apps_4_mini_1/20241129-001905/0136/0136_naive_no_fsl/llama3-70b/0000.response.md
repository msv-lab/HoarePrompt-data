Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases of input, particularly the case where two numbers are equal but have different representations due to leading zeros.

For example, consider the following input:

```
00000000
0
```

In this case, both numbers represent the same value (0), but when the program removes leading zeros, `a` becomes an empty string and `b` becomes "0". When comparing an empty string to "0", the program will incorrectly determine that `a < b` (since an empty string is considered less than any non-empty string in Python).

Thus, the program fails to handle this edge case correctly, leading to incorrect output. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
