Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases where the two integers can have different lengths after stripping leading zeros. For instance, when comparing two numbers of different lengths after leading zeros are removed, the shorter number is always less than the longer number.

Consider the following potential case:
Input:
```
000000123
0000000123
```
In this case, after stripping leading zeros, both `a` and `b` will be equal to `123`, and the program will incorrectly output `=` instead of the correct comparison result.

Another example:
Input:
```
000000001
00000001
```
In this case, after stripping leading zeros, both `a` and `b` will be equal to `1`, and the program will output `=` instead of determining their actual relation considering the leading zeroes.

The code fails to account for the fact that different lengths (after leading zero removal) should dictate the comparison result. Therefore, the program's logic is incorrect, leading to a conclusion of faulty correctness.
