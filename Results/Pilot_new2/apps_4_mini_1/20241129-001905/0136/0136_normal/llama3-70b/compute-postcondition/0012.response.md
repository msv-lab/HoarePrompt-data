Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integer inputs as strings, removes any leading zeroes, and compares the two numbers. It prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first number is less than the second, and '>' if the first number is greater than the second. The function does not return any values; it only outputs the comparison result. **
