The `print('=')` statement outputs a string of equal signs but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `a` and `b` remain the same as before, with `a` being equal to `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input string with leading zeros removed; `b` is the input string without leading zeros. The values of `a` and `b` are still equal.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeros removed; `b` is the input string without leading zeros; `a` is equal to `b`.**
