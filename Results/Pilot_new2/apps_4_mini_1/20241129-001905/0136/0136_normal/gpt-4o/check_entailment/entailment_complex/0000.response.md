Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-negative integers as strings from the input using `input().split()`. This allows it to handle the entire input line as specified. The use of `split()` ensures it handles whitespace appropriately and retrieves the two integers efficiently.

2. **Leading Zeros**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both integers. This is essential as the problem requires the comparison to be made without considering leading zeros. If one of the strings becomes empty after removing zeros, it is correctly assigned the value '0'.

3. **Length Comparison**: The program first compares the lengths of the stripped strings `a` and `b`. This is a valid approach since, in numeric comparison, a longer string represents a larger number if both strings are of the same format (i.e., non-negative integers).

4. **Lexicographic Comparison**: When the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, the program proceeds to perform a lexicographic comparison. This is appropriate for non-negative integers represented as strings, as it accurately reflects their numeric values.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct comparative symbols ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison results, which directly fulfills the output requirements of the problem description.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program comprehensively handles cases where both numbers might be zero, or where leading zeros may affect the initial comparison. It ensures that the outputs are consistent with expected results for all given examples in the problem description.

In summary, the program accurately implements the logic needed to compare two very large non-negative integers (up to \(10^6\) digits) represented as strings while adhering to the specifications outlined in the problem description. Thus, it delivers the expected results for all possible cases that can arise based on the input constraints.
