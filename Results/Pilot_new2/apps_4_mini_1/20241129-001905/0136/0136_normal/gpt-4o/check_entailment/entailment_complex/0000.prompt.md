You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".


-----Examples-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function reads two non-negative integers a and b from input, each represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes, and each string can be up to 10^6 digits long.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If `a` is '0', then `b` remains the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed. The else part does not exist in this case.
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'.
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be greater than `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are equal. Furthermore, `a` is '0' if and only if `b` is '0', and the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If `a` is less than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be less than `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be greater than `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are equal. Additionally, `a` is '0' if and only if `b` is '0', and the lengths of `a` and `b` remain equal throughout.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, then the output is '>'. Otherwise, if the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, it is confirmed whether `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to `b`. Additionally, `a` is '0' if and only if `b` is '0', and the lengths of `a` and `b` remain equal throughout.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output '<' has been printed. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, it is confirmed whether `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to `b`, while ensuring that `a` is '0' if and only if `b` is '0', and the lengths of `a` and `b` remain equal throughout.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two non-negative integers as strings from input, potentially containing leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first integer is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either integer is an empty string after removing leading zeros, it is treated as '0'. The function correctly handles cases where the integers are long, up to \(10^6\) digits, but does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
