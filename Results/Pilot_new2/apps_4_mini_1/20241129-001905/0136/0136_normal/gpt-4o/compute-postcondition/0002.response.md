`b` is assigned the value of the second element of `data` (which is a string) with leading zeros removed using `lstrip('0')`. The first element `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings; `a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed; `b` is the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed.

Output State: **`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings; `a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed; `b` is the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed.**
