The code snippet executes a print statement which does not change any variable states. It simply prints the character '<'. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the action that has taken place.

Output State: **`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'. The current value of `a` has a length less than the current value of `b`, and the output '<' has been printed.**
