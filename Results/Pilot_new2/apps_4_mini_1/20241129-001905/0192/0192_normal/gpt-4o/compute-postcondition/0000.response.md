The variables `x` and `y` are assigned values from the input using the `map(int, input().split())` function, which reads two integers from the input. The previous condition states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, meaning `y` must be less than `x`, and both `y` and `x` must be within the specified range. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will now reflect the user input, while the conditions regarding their relationship still hold.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers based on user input; 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100000.**
