To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and calculations used in the `func_1` function.

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. The code calculates the number of days as `total_days = 2 ** n`.
2. It initializes the `numerator` and `denominator` for the probability calculation.
3. It then computes the numerator as the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`, and the denominator as `total_days` raised to the power of `k`.
4. The GCD of the numerator and denominator is calculated, and both are divided by this GCD to simplify the fraction.
5. Finally, it returns both the numerator and denominator modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Large Values of k**: If \(k > 2^n\), the program will not handle this correctly. In such cases, it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, hence the result should be `A=1`, `B=1`. The logic does not check for this condition.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD is calculated on the original `numerator` and `denominator`, but since the calculations use large numbers (especially when `k` is large), there could be issues with integer overflow or performance.
3. **Efficiency and Performance**: The computation may take a significant time for very large `k` since it computes products in a loop for `k` iterations. This makes it impractical for \(k\) approaching \(10^{18}\).

**Example Cases to Demonstrate Incorrectness:**
- Consider the input `(1, 3)`. According to the problem description, since there are only 2 days in the year, having 3 people guarantees that at least two people will share a birthday, resulting in `A=1` and `B=1`. However, the current implementation will not handle this case correctly since it will attempt to calculate the numerator and denominator without checking the condition \(k > 2^n\).

Given the above analysis, the program does not conform to the problem description correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
