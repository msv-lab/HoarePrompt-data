The code snippet provided is a print statement that outputs the values of `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`. The values of `A` and `B` are already defined in the initial state. 

`A` is equal to `p_shared // g`, and `B` is equal to `p_total // g`. The variable `g` is derived from the result of `func_1(p_shared, p_total)`, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state.

After executing the print statement, the values of `A` and `B` are not changed; they simply display the results of the modulus operation. Thus, the output will reflect whatever the values of `A % MOD` and `B % MOD` are based on the current values of `A`, `B`, and `MOD`.

Output State: **`A` is equal to `p_shared // g`, `B` is equal to `p_total // g`, `g` is equal to the result of `func_1(p_shared, p_total), output is (A % MOD, B % MOD)**.
