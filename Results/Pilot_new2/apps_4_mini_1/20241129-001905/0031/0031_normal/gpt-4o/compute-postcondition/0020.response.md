To determine the output state after executing the given code, we proceed step by step:

1. **Initial Variables:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \)
   - `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \)
   - `MOD` is 1000003
   - `total_days` is 2
   - `numerator` is 0
   - `denominator` is \( 2^k \mod 1000003 \)
   - `p_no_shared` is 0
   - `p_total` is equal to `denominator`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code calculates `p_shared` using the formula:
     \[
     p\_shared = (p\_total - p\_no\_shared + MOD) \% MOD
     \]
   - We know:
     - \( p\_total = denominator = 2^k \mod 1000003 \)
     - \( p\_no\_shared = 0 \)

3. **Substituting Values:**
   - The equation simplifies to:
     \[
     p\_shared = (denominator - 0 + MOD) \% MOD
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     p\_shared = (denominator + 1000003) \% 1000003
     \]

4. **Resulting Value of `p_shared`:**
   - Since `denominator` is already calculated as \( 2^k \mod 1000003 \), adding 1000003 does not change the modulo result:
     \[
     p\_shared = denominator
     \]

5. **Final Output State:**
   - The values of other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state will reflect the new value of `p_shared` while maintaining the conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is \(2^k \mod 1000003\), `p_no_shared` is 0, `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is equal to `denominator`.**
