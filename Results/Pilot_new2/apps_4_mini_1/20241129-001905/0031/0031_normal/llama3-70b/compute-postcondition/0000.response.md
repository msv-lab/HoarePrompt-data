The value of `total_days` is assigned the value of \(2^n\). The initial state specifies that \(n\) is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), and therefore \(total_days\) will be a value that is the result of raising 2 to the power of \(n\). The value of \(k\) remains unchanged. 

Thus, the updated values of the variables are:
- `total_days` is \(2^n\)
- `k` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\)

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\)**.
