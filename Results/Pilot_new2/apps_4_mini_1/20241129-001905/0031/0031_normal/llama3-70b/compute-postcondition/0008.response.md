The `denominator` is updated by multiplying it by `total_days`. Given that `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\) and `denominator` is equal to \(2^n\) before the operation, we can calculate the new value of `denominator`. 

The previous value of `denominator` is \(2^n\), and after the operation, it will be:
\[
denominator = denominator \times total_days = 2^n \times 2^n = (2^n)^2 = 2^{2n}
\]

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\); `numerator` is equal to \(2^n \times (2^n - 1)\); `denominator` is equal to \(2^{2n}\); `i` is 1**
