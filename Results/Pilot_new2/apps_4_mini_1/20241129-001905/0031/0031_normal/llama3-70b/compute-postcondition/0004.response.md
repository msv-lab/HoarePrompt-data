The value of `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\). The code updates the `numerator` by multiplying it with `total_days - i`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the calculation for `numerator` will be:

\[
numerator = 1 \times (total_days - 0) = total_days
\]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `numerator` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is equal to \(2^n\`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
