Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the probability calculation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for computing the `numerator` and `denominator` is flawed in handling the situation when `k` exceeds `total_days` (which equals \(2^n\)).

Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling the Case When `k > total_days`:** If the number of people `k` is greater than the number of available days (`total_days`), the probability that at least two people share a birthday should be 1 (i.e., \(A = 1\), \(B = 1\)). The current implementation does not account for this scenario, and it continues to calculate `numerator` and `denominator`, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Calculation of the `denominator`:** The denominator is computed as \(2^{nk}\), which is incorrect. The denominator should simply represent the total possible birthday assignments for `k` people over `total_days`, which is \(total_days^k\).

3. **GCD Calculation After Modulo Operation:** The program reduces `numerator` and `denominator` modulo \(10^6 + 3\) after computing the GCD, but the GCD should be calculated on the actual values before taking modulo to ensure that \(A\) and \(B\) are coprime prior to the modulo operation.

Because of these issues, particularly the failure to handle the case where `k > total_days`, the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, it is deemed incorrect.
