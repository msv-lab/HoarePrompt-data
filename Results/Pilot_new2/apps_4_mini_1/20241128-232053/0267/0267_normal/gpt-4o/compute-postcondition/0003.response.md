`total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Given that `total_sum` is initially 0, the new value of `total_sum` will simply be `num % MOD`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is equal to `num % MOD`, `l` is the starting point of the loop, `r` is at least `l`, `num` starts at `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true.

Output State: **`total_sum` is equal to `num % MOD`, `l` is the starting point of the loop, `r` is at least `l`, `num` starts at `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true.**
