According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `num` in the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. Since it is given that `1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18`, `l` and `r` are valid integers within the specified bounds. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

At the start of the loop, `num` will take the value of `l` on the first iteration, which is valid. The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. The variable `k` is not referenced in the loop, so it does not influence whether the loop runs or its execution.

Therefore, the only necessary considerations are that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and that `num` should begin at `l`.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is the starting point of the loop, `r` is at least `l`, `num` starts at `l`**
