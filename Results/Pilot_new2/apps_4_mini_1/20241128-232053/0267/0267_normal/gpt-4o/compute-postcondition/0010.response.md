Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is equal to `(((r % MOD) + (r + 1)) % MOD + r) % MOD` when `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, with `num` being `r`, and both `l` and `r` remaining unchanged. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, the initial conditions remain unchanged, and `total_sum` does not get updated.***
