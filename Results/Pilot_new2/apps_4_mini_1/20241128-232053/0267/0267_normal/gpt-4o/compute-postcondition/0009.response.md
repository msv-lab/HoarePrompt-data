The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous state of `total_sum` was `((num % MOD) + (num + 1)) % MOD`. Thus, after the operation, `total_sum` will be equal to `((num % MOD) + (num + 1)) % MOD + num) % MOD`.

Since `num` is given as `r`, we can substitute `r` in place of `num`. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` will be calculated as follows:

1. Previous value: `total_sum = ((r % MOD) + (r + 1)) % MOD`
2. Update the value: `total_sum = ((r % MOD) + (r + 1)) % MOD + r) % MOD`

The states of `num`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, but `total_sum` has been updated. 

Output State: **`total_sum` is equal to `(((r % MOD) + (r + 1)) % MOD + r) % MOD`, `num` is `r`, `l` is unchanged, and `r` is unchanged**.
