To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the functionality and logic of the program relative to the requirements specified.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
The task is to compute the sum of integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that contain at most `k` different digits, and return this sum modulo `998244353`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Functionality**: The program includes two functions: `func_1` and `count`. 
    - `func_1` is the main function that computes the final sum by calling the `count` function for the range [l, r].
    - `count` is responsible for counting how many integers up to `n` contain at most `k` different digits.

2. **Counting Digits**: 
    - The `count` function appears to use a memoization technique (with the `dp` dictionary) to store previously computed results for pairs of `(n, k)`.
    - It checks if a number `n` has fewer than `10^k` digits, in which case it directly returns `n`, implying all numbers below `n` are valid.
    - If `n` is greater, it calculates possible combinations of numbers with up to `k` different digits.

3. **Issue with Calculation**:
    - The program does not explicitly compute the sum of all valid numbers from `l` to `r`. Instead, it seems to compute a count of numbers with at most `k` different digits and returns that count modulo `998244353`.
    - The actual requirement is to sum those valid numbers, not just count them.

4. **Missing Sum Logic**: 
    - The logic for summing the valid integers is not implemented in the `count` function. The problem description requires a summation, while the provided code appears to implement a counting mechanism instead.
    - The return value from `count` is used in `func_1` for subtraction, which seems to compute a range of counts rather than the actual sum of valid numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to implement the required logic to calculate the actual sum of integers from `l` to `r` that have at most `k` different digits. Instead, it is focused on counting valid numbers, which does not fulfill the problem's requirements.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
