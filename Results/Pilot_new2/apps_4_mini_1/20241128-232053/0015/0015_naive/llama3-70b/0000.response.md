Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether the integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the constant difference `c`. 

1. If `c` is zero, the only element in the sequence is `a`. The program correctly returns "YES" if `a` is equal to `b`, and "NO" otherwise.
2. If `c` is not zero, the program checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and ensures that the result `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, which ensures that we only consider positive indices of the sequence.

Through the logic of the program, it correctly addresses all potential edge cases based on the problem description, including:
- The case where `c` is zero (the sequence doesn't progress).
- Cases where `b` can fall before `a` in the sequence.
- Cases where the sequence starts at `a` and increases or decreases based on `c`.

All given examples in the problem description are handled correctly, which shows that the program is functioning as intended across all valid inputs.
