To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and how the program implements them.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The sequence starts with `s_1 = a`.
2. The difference between consecutive elements is `c`, which means the nth term can be expressed as:
   \[
   s_i = a + (i - 1) \cdot c
   \]
3. We need to find out if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.
4. Rearranging the equation gives:
   \[
   b = a + (i - 1) \cdot c \implies (b - a) = (i - 1) \cdot c
   \]
   \[
   \implies i - 1 = \frac{b - a}{c} \implies i = \frac{b - a}{c} + 1
   \]
5. For `i` to be a positive integer:
   - If `c` is not zero, `(b - a) % c` must equal 0, and `(b - a) / c` must be non-negative.
   - If `c` equals 0, the only valid case for `b` to be in the sequence is when `b` equals `a`.

### Program Logic:
1. Check if `b == a`. If true, print 'YES'.
2. If `c == 0`, print 'NO' since the sequence cannot reach any number other than `a`.
3. If `c != 0`, check:
   - If `(b - a) % c == 0`: This confirms that the difference is divisible by `c`.
   - If `(b - a) / c >= 0`: This ensures that the index `i` calculated would be positive.

### Evaluation of the Program:
- The program correctly checks if `b` is equal to `a` first, as this is a straightforward condition for 'YES'.
- It handles the case where `c` is zero correctly by returning 'NO' if `b` is not equal to `a`.
- For non-zero `c`, it checks divisibility and the non-negativity of the index computed from the difference.

### Conclusion:
The program covers all cases defined in the problem description and outputs the correct response based on the conditions derived from the sequence properties.

Correctness: **True**
