The code snippet `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' but does not alter any variable values or states. The initial state remains unchanged as no assignments or modifications are made to the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that are equal to the three integers input by the user, `b` is not equal to `a`, and the current value of `c` is 0.**
