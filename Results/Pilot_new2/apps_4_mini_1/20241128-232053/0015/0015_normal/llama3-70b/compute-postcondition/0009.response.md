The code `print('YES')` outputs the string 'YES', but it does not change the values of any of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The precondition remains valid, so the output state should reflect that.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values, `c` is not equal to 0, the current value of `b - a` is divisible by `c`, and the quotient of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. The output 'YES' has been printed.**
