The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and no variables are modified. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program has printed 'NO' while leaving the integer variables intact.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values, `c` is not equal to 0, and either `(b - a) % c != 0` or `(b - a) / c < 0` holds true; the program printed 'NO'.**
