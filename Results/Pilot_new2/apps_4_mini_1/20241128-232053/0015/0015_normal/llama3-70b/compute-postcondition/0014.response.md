The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it processes the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are constrained within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, resulting in an output based on the specified conditions related to these integers. 

Since no specific conditions or outputs are provided in the output section, we cannot define the precise behavior or return values of the function without further details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes integers a, b, and c within the defined constraints, but the specific return values or behavior are not specified.**
