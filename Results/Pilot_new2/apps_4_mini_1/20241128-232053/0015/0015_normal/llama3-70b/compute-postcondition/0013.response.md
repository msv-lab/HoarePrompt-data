Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values. If `c` equals 0 and `a` equals `b`, then 'YES' is printed, and `c` remains 0. If `c` equals 0 and `a` does not equal `b`, `c` is still 0. If `c` is not equal to 0, then if the difference `b - a` is divisible by `c` and the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if either `b - a` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, 'NO' is printed.***
