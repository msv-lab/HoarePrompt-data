Correctness: **True**

The given program accurately checks whether a favorite integer `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and a common difference `c`. Let's break down the logic of the program in relation to the problem description:

1. **Handling the case when `c` is 0**:
   - If the difference `c` is zero, the sequence does not change; every element in the sequence is equal to `a`. 
   - The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES", indicating that `b` appears in the sequence. If they are not equal, it prints "NO". This correctly reflects the problem description.

2. **Handling the case when `c` is non-zero**:
   - When `c` is not zero, the program checks if `b` can be expressed in the form of the sequence starting from `a` with increments of `c`. This is done through two conditions:
     - It checks whether the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` using the condition `(b - a) % c == 0`. This ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding some multiple of `c`.
     - It also checks that the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. This ensures that we are moving forward in the sequence (i.e., `b` is greater than or equal to `a` if `c` is positive, or `b` is less than or equal to `a` if `c` is negative).
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program comprehensively covers all scenarios outlined in the problem statement, correctly identifying when `b` is present in the sequence or not. Thus, it aligns with the requirements of the problem.
