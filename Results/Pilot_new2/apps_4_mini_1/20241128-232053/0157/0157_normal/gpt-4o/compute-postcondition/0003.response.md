In the given code snippet, `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value from three calculations: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided as input integers.

1. `a` remains an input integer.
2. `b // 2` calculates half of `b`.
3. `c // 4` calculates a quarter of `c`.
4. `max_lemons` takes the smallest of these three values.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
