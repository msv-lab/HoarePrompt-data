To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function and its logic in relation to the stated requirements.

The problem description specifies that Nikolay has a certain number of lemons, apples, and pears and that he wants to make a compote according to the ratio of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears). Therefore, for each lemon used, he needs exactly 2 apples and 4 pears.

Now, let's break down the provided program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. This part of the program correctly captures the input.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits. It considers:
   - The total number of lemons `a`.
   - The number of apples divided by 2, since each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - The number of pears divided by 4, since each lemon requires 4 pears.
   This ensures that the program does not exceed the number of fruits available.

3. **Calculating Total Fruits**: The total number of fruits that can be used in the compote is calculated by `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. This correctly computes the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons determined earlier.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits, which is the expected output.

Now, let's consider the edge cases as presented in the problem description:

- **Edge Case 1**: If `a = 2`, `b = 5`, `c = 7`, the function will calculate:
  - `max_lemons = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
  - Thus, `total_fruits = 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 4 = 7`, which matches the expected output.
  
- **Edge Case 2**: If `a = 4`, `b = 7`, `c = 13`, the calculation would yield:
  - `max_lemons = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
  - Thus, `total_fruits = 3 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 21`, which also matches the expected output.

- **Edge Case 3**: If `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`, then:
  - `max_lemons = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
  - Thus, `total_fruits = 0`, matching the expected output.

After analyzing all parts of the program in relation to the problem description, it consistently adheres to the requirements set forth. The logic for calculating maximum lemons and total fruits is correct, and all edge cases yield the expected results.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **True**
