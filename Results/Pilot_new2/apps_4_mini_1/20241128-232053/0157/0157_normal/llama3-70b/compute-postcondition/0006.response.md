Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters directly and prompts the user to input three positive integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed, where each set consists of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The function prints the total value derived from these sets, which is computed as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the computed result. All inputs must be between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the function does not handle cases where the inputs are outside this range.**
