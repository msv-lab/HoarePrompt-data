Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the required ratio of 1:2:4. 

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum of the number of lemons available (`a`), half the number of apples available (`b // 2`, since 2 apples are needed for each lemon), and a quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`, since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).
3. Finally, it computes the total number of fruits used in the compote as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which corresponds to the total number of lemons, apples, and pears used based on the ratio.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when one type of fruit is insufficient to create even a single batch of compote (e.g., if `c` is less than 4, it will correctly result in `0` since `min_lemon` will be `0`).

Therefore, since it meets all specified requirements correctly and handles all potential edge cases, the program is correct.
