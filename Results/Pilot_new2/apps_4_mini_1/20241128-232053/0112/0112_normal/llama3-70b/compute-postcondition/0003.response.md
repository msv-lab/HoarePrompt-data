According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the `cubes` list must contain at least 1 sublist (since `n` is at least 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `cubes` must not be empty. 

At the start of the loop execution, the variable `cube` will be assigned the first sublist from `cubes`. Thus, we can conclude the following adjustments:

- `cubes` must have at least 1 sublist.
- `cube` is now the first sublist in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers that must have at least 1 sublist, `cube` is the first sublist in `cubes`**
