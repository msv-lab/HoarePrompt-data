According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `cubes` has at least 2 sublists. Since `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`, the loop has executed once for the first sublist and once for the second sublist. 

To execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 3 sublists, and the loop will then process the third sublist. Thus, the updated state should reflect that we're now looking at the third sublist, and `cube` will need to be updated accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers that must have at least 3 sublists; `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include the string representations of integers from `cube`.**
