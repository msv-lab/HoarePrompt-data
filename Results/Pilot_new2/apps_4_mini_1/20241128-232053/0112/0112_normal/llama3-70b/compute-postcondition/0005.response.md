According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more sublists in `cubes` to iterate through. The variable `n` indicates the number of sublists in `cubes`, and since it is given that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3`, it means there are either 1, 2, or 3 sublists available. At the end of the last iteration, `cube` refers to the first sublist in `cubes`, which means the loop has executed once for the first sublist. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to check how many sublists remain.

If `n` is 1, the loop cannot execute again. If `n` is 2, the second sublist can be accessed, and if `n` is 3, the third sublist will be accessed next. After processing the first sublist, we must increment the iteration to refer to the next sublist.

Thus, if the loop has executed once for the first sublist, to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 2 sublists, `cube` will refer to the second sublist, and `n` must be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers that must have at least 2 sublists; `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include the string representations of integers from `cube`.**
