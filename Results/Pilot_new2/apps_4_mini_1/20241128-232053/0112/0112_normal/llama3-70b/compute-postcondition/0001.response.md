The variable `cubes` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the input split into integers for `n` times. The value of `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, meaning `cubes` will contain 1 to 3 lists, each populated with the integers parsed from the input.

The output state remains the same for `n`, but `cubes` will now contain the lists based on the input provided during execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers from input.**
