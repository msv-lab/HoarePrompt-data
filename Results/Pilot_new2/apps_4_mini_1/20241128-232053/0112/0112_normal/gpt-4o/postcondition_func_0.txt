The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cubes` containing `n` sublists of exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the digits on the faces of the cubes. It counts how many consecutive integers starting from 1 can be formed using the digits on these cubes, stopping when it can no longer form a number, and returns that count. The return value can be less than 3 if not all digits from 1 to 3 can be formed.
