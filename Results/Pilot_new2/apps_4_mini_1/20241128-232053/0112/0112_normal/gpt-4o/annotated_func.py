#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and cubes is a list of n lists, where each sublist contains exactly 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes, with each integer a_{i}_{j} satisfying 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9.

    x = 0

        x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` must contain at least one list that includes the digits 1, 2, and 3 on their faces; `cube_faces` must have sets that include the digits 1, 2, and 3; `x` is now 3.
    return x
    #The program returns the value of x, which is now 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cubes` containing `n` sublists of exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the digits on the faces of the cubes. It counts how many consecutive integers starting from 1 can be formed using the digits on these cubes, stopping when it can no longer form a number, and returns that count. The return value can be less than 3 if not all digits from 1 to 3 can be formed.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where elements are set to `True` for all cubes that matched the corresponding digits in `digits`, and remain `False` for those that did not; `digits` contains elements indicating the digits processed; `digit` is the last element in `digits`; `found` is `True` if at least one match was found during all iterations, otherwise it could be `False` if no matches were found for a `digit`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the function is confirming a successful match was found during the iterations based on the previous conditions set for 'found'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` and checks whether it can be formed using a set of cubes, where each cube has a set of digits. It returns `True` if every digit in `num` can be matched with a different cube's face without reusing any cube; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function assumes the existence of a global variable `cube_faces`, which contains the digits available on the faces of the cubes, and `n` must be defined within the scope indicating the number of cubes. If the cubes cannot provide a valid combination for all digits in `num`, it returns `False`.
