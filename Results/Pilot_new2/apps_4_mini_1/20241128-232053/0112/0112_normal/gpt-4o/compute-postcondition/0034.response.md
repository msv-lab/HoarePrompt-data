The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables, specifically `n` and `used_cubes`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `used_cubes`, while noting that `found` is now `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, with `used_cubes[0]` being True; `found` is True.**
