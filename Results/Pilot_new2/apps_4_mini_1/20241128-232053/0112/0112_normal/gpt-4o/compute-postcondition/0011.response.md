The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`. Initially, `used_cubes[0]` is `True` and `used_cubes[1]` is `False`, and since `i` is `1`, this will change `used_cubes[1]` to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 2, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` as `True` and `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, `found` is `True`, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[i]` is `True`, `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` as `True` and `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, `found` is `True`, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[i]` is `True`, `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.**
