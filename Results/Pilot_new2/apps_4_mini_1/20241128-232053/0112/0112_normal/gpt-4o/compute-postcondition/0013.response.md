The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 2, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` as `True` and `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, `found` is `True`, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[i]` is `True`, `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
