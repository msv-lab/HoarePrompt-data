According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be at least 2, which allows the loop to execute again for `i = 2`.

Given that `used_cubes` is a list with a length of `n` and `used_cubes[0]` and `used_cubes[1]` are both `True`, it implies that `used_cubes[2]` has not been addressed yet. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The rest of the state remains unchanged since we have sufficient information for the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` as `True`, `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, and `used_cubes[2]` as `False`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, `found` is `True`, `i` is 2, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`**
