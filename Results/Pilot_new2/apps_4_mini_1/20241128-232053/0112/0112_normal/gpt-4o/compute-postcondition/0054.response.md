According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. Since `n` is still within its range, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes` remains the same.**
