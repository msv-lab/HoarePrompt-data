Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `0`, `found` is False, `i` is 0, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is False, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.***
