Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, with `used_cubes[0]` being True; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `0`; if `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
