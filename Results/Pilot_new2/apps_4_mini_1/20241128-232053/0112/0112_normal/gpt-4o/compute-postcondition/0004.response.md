According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 3, the loop will execute at least once. Additionally, `i` will start at 0 and increment with each iteration of the loop. 

Before the loop starts, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, which is suitable for the loop's execution since `n` is between 1 and 3. The `digits` list must have at least 1 element, and `digit` is set to the first element of `digits`, indicating that it's already ready for the loop's operations.

Thus, the adjusted states should include `i` starting at 0 and the conditions that ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, `digits` must have at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0**
