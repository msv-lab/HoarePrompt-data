According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If `digits` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time for the next `digit`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, `digit` is the next element in `digits`, and `found` indicates that at least one `used_cubes[i]` was set to `True`. Given that `digit` is currently the next element, the next `digit` should be the element after the last processed index, meaning the index will increment by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `digits` must contain at least 2 elements, and thus the index of `digit` needs to be incremented accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`; `digits` has at least 2 elements; `digit` is the next element in `digits` following the last processed index; `found` is `True`.**
