The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, with `used_cubes[0]` being True; `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
