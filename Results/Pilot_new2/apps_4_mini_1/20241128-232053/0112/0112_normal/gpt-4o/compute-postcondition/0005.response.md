Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is `False`, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.***
