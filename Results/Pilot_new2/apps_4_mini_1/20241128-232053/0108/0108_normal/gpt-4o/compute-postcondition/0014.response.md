The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` must be less than `len(s)`; variable `j` is increased by 1.
