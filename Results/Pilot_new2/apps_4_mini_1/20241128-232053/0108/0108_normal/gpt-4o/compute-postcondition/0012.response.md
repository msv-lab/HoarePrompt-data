The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `i` can take on a variety of values based on the length of the string `s`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 25; otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program; and `i` is now incremented by 1.
