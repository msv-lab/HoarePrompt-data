The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous condition states that `j` must be less than 26, which implies that after the increment, `j` will now be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 25. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `j` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 25.**
