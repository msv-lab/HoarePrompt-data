The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The current value of `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, therefore `j` will now point to the next character in `target`. Other variables are not affected. Consequently, the output state reflects the updated value of `j`, while maintaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `target[1]`.**
