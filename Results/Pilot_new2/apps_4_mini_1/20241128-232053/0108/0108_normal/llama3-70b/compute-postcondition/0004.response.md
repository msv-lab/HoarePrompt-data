According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is found within the string `s`. Right before the loop, `char` is 'a', and `s` is a string consisting of small English letters. For the loop to execute at least once, the string `s` must contain the character 'a'. Therefore, the state of `s` needs to be adjusted to ensure that 'a' is included in it.

State: **`s` must contain 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
