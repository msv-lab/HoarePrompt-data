The variable `s` undergoes a transformation where the first occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced by the character that is one position after `char` in the ASCII table (i.e., `chr(ord(char) + 1)`). The variable `res` remains unchanged in this operation, as it is not directly modified by the code provided.

Since `s` must contain the updated `char`, we specify that the first occurrence of `char` is replaced, and thus `s` will contain the new character in place of the old one. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`s` contains the updated character (one position after `char` in ASCII), `res` is equal to `res + char`.**
