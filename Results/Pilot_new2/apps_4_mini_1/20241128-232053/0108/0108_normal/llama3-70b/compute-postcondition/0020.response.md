The code updates the string `s` by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the ASCII sequence (which is determined by `chr(ord(char) + 1)`). Since `s` must contain at least one occurrence of `char`, this replacement will successfully occur, changing `s`. The value of `res` is updated to the previous value of `res` plus the original `char`.

Thus, the output state reflects the new value of `s` and the updated value of `res`, while stating that `s` contains the modified string and `res` now includes the `char`.

Output State: **`s` contains the modified string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII; `res` is updated to `res + char`.**
