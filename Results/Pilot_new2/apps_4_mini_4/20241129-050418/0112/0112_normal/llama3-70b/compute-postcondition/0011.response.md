The `remove` method is called on the set `digits`, which will remove the string '0' from it. Since '0' is included in `digits`, it will be successfully removed. The variable `n` and the `cubes` list are not affected by this operation, and the only change is to the `digits` set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing string representations of all integers present in all lists of `cubes`, excluding the string '0'.**
