According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` contains at least 3 lists, the loop will execute one more time for the third list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is in the range of 2 to 3, which means `cubes` contains either 2 or 3 lists. Since `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, if the loop is to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 3 lists, and `cube` would then be the third list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer in the range 3 to 3, `cubes` is a list containing 3 lists of integers, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated to include string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
