According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3. Since the loop iterates from 0 to n-1, the current value of `i` must be less than n.

Since `n` must be at least 3, and we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can denote it as `i` (where `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to have executed twice). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, and since the last value of `i` after the previous iteration is not specified but implied to be less than `n`, we can denote the next value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is at least 3**
