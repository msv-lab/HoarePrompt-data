Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `found` is True if at least one `used_cubes[i]` was set to True during the loop execution; otherwise, `found` remains False if no cubes were found that contain the digit. The `used_cubes` array reflects the state of each cube, with `used_cubes[i]` being True for any cube used to match the digit and False for those not used. If the loop does not execute, `found` remains False and all `used_cubes` retain their initial states.**
