The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 4, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is at least 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
