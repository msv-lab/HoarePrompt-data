The variable `used_cubes[i]` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `used_cubes[i]` was `False`, and since `i` is 0, only the first element of `used_cubes` is affected. The other variables remain unchanged and valid: `n` must be at least 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, and `i` is 0. The variable `digit` is also still present in `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[0]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[0]**.
