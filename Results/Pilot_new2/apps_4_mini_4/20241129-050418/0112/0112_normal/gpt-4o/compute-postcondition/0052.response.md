The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[0]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
