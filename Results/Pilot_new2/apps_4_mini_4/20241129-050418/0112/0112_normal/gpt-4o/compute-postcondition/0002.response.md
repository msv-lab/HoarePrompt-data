According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. The variable `n` is defined to be between 1 and 3, which suggests that there is at least one digit. 

Additionally, the loop will iterate over each character in `digits`, so the state of `digit` should represent the first character in the list during the first iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `digits` has at least 1 character and that the first character can be represented by `digit`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list**
