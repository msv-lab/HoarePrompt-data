The value of `found` is assigned `False`. Previously, `found` was `true`, but now it has been updated. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `found` is false, and `used_cubes` reflects the state of cubes that were successfully used.**
