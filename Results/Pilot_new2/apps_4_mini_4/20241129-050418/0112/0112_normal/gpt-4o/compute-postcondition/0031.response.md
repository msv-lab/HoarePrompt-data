Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `found` is set to True, `i` is 0, and the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True if `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
