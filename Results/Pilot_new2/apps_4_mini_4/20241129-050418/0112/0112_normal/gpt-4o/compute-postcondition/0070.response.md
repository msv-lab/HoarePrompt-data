The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is an integer. The function evaluates several conditions based on the cubes and their faces. 

- If the conditions defined by the logic or context are not met, the function returns `False`.
- If no cubes are found that contain the specified digit, the function returns `False`.
- If the digit was not found in any of the cube faces up to the specified index, and a flag `found` remains `False`, the function returns `False`.
- If all matched digits have been successfully found, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and return `True` if all matched digits have been found successfully; otherwise, it returns `False` based on various conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num and returns True if all matched digits have been found successfully; otherwise, it returns False based on specific conditions.**
