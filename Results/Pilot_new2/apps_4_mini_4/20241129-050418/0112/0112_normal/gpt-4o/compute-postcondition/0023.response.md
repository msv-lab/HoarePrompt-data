Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is true, and `used_cubes` reflects the state of cubes that were successfully used (true if used, false if not).***
