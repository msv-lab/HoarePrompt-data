The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `digits`, and `digit`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list and `found` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, and `found` is False.**
