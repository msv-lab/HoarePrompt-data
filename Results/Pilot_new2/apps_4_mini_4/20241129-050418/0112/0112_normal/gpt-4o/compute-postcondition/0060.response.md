The code sets the value of `used_cubes[i]` to `True`. The variable `i` is 4, so the element at index 4 of the `used_cubes` list is affected, changing its value to `True`. No other variables are impacted, and the previous values or conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is 4, and `used_cubes[4]` is True.**
