Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list. If `used_cubes[0]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[0]`, then `found` is set to True, `used_cubes[0]` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
