The code `used_cubes[i] = True` assigns the value `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. The variable `i` has the value `2`, so the third element of the list `used_cubes` is now set to `True`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `digits`, `digit`, and `found`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 â‰¤ `n`; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters; `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list; `found` is set to True; `i` is 2; `used_cubes[2]` is True.**
