In the provided code, `used_cubes[i]` is being assigned the value `True`. Since the initial state indicates that `used_cubes[i]` is updated to `True` only if it was previously `False` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, the current assignment will change the status of `used_cubes[i]` to `True`. 

We know that `i` is 1, so we will only update `used_cubes[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and will still reflect their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `i` is 1, `found` is set to True, and `used_cubes[1]` is True.**
