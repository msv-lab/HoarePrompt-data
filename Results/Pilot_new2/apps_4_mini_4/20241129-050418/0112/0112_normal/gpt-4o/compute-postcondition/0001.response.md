The code initializes a list called `used_cubes` with `n` elements, all set to `False`. The value of `n` is constrained to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, meaning the possible lengths of `used_cubes` can be 1, 2, or 3. Thus, `used_cubes` will be a list of `n` boolean values, all initialized to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values equal to `[False] * n`.**
