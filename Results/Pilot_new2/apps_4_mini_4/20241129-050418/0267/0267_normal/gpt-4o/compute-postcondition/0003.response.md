The line of code updates the value of `total_sum` by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged, but `total_sum` will be updated based on the operation performed.

Given that `total_sum` is initially `0` and `num` is `l`, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state reflects this update.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, and `num` is `l`.**
