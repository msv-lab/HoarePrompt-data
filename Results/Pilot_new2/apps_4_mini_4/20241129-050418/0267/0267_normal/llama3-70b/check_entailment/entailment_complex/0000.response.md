To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze how the program works in light of the problem description and the provided annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program is supposed to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that contain at most `k` different digits, and return this sum modulo `998244353`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function computes the count of valid numbers in the range `[l, r]` by calling the `count` function for both `r` and `l-1`, then taking the difference and returning it modulo `MOD`.
   - However, it is unclear how the actual sum of those valid numbers is computed. The current logic only appears to count how many numbers exist that meet the digit criteria, not to sum them.

2. **Function 2 (`count`)**:
   - This function is supposed to count numbers with at most `k` different digits up to `n`.
   - The logic in this function looks at the range based on the value of `k` and the digits of `n`, but it does not seem to compute the actual sum of the numbers. It only counts how many numbers exist that meet the criteria.

### Missing Logic:
- There is no implementation for summing the numbers that satisfy the digit condition. The output of `func_1` will only reflect the count of such numbers, but the problem requires a sum. 
- The annotations note that the function `count` returns values based on certain calculations, but again, these calculations do not yield the actual sum of numbers, which is the primary requirement of the problem.

### Example Case Analysis:
- For the input `10 50 2`, the expected output is `1230`, which is the sum of numbers `10-50` that contain at most `2` different digits. However, based on the current implementation, the program will not return the sum, but rather just a count, leading to incorrect results.
  
- In the provided example, for `k = 1`, it should return the sum of numbers like `11, 22, 33, 44`. The logic does not directly compute these sums, and this holds for any input where `k` could be more than `1` or a range where special cases arise based on digit composition.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the required sum of numbers, and it does not handle cases to ensure the output matches the problem description for all potential inputs, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
