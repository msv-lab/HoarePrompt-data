To analyze the provided code snippet:

1. The variable `dp[n, k]` initially has a value of 9.
2. The variable `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer such that \(1 < k \leq 10\).
3. The expression being computed is:
   \[
   dp[n, k] += 9 \times 10^{(i - 1)} \times (10^{(k - i)} - 10^{(i - 1)})
   \]

   Breaking it down:
   - \(10^{(i - 1)}\) computes \(10^{0} = 1\) since \(i = 1\).
   - \(10^{(k - i)}\) computes \(10^{(k - 1)}\).
   - The term \(10^{(k - 1)} - 10^{0}\) becomes \(10^{(k - 1)} - 1\).
   - Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   dp[n, k] += 9 \times 1 \times (10^{(k - 1)} - 1)
   \]
   Which further simplifies to:
   \[
   dp[n, k] += 9 \times (10^{(k - 1)} - 1)
   \]

4. Since \(dp[n, k]\) initially is 9, after substituting:
   \[
   dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 \times (10^{(k - 1)} - 1) = 9 \times 10^{(k - 1)}
   \]

The final value of `dp[n, k]` will depend on the value of `k`, which can vary between 2 and 10. However, since we are not provided with specific values for `k`, we will express `dp[n, k]` in terms of `k`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 < `k` <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is 9 * 10**(k - 1), `i` is 1**
