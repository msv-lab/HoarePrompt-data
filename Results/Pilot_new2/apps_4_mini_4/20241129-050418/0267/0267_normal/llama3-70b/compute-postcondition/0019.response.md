Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\); `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\) and \(k \neq 0\). If `n` is less than \(10^k\), then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10` and then `dp[n, k]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
