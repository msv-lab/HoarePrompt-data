To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to examine the loop statement and the conditions provided.

The for loop is structured as follows:
```
for i in range(1, k):
```
This means that the loop will iterate over the values of `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `k`.

Given the following states:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\) and \(k \neq 0\)
- `dp[n, k]` is 9

Now, let's analyze what needs to be true for the loop to execute:

1. The loop will execute if the range of the for loop is valid. Specifically, it will execute if `k` is greater than 1, because `range(1, k)` includes 1 and excludes `k`. If `k` equals 1, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

2. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take the value of 1 during the first iteration.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `k` is greater than 1, and we can state the initial value of `i` at the start of the loop's execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should reflect that `k` must be greater than 1 and also confirm that `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 < `k` <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is 1**
