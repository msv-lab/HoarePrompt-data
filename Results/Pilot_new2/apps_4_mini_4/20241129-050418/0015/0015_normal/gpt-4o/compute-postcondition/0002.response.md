The code executes a `print` statement which does not alter any of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The output of this code is simply the string 'YES', but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state regarding the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers, and the current value of `b` is equal to the current value of `a`, and 'YES' is printed.**
