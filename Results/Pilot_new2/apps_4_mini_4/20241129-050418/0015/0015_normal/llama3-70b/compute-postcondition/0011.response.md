The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged after the print statement. The conditions provided in the Initial State remain valid, indicating that `(b - a) % c` is not equal to 0 or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that have been assigned new values based on input provided, the value of `c` is not equal to 0, and either `(b - a) % c` is not equal to 0 or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0; 'NO' has been printed.**
