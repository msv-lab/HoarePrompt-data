Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite integer \( b \) appears in the sequence defined by the first element \( a \) and the constant difference \( c \).

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Handling the case when \( c = 0 \)**: 
   - If \( c \) is zero, the sequence will consist of the repeated element \( a \). The program checks if \( a \) is equal to \( b \). If they are equal, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This is correct because if \( c = 0 \), the only element in the sequence is \( a \).

2. **Handling the case when \( c \neq 0 \)**:
   - The program checks if the difference \( (b - a) \) is divisible by \( c \) using the modulus operator. This checks if \( b \) can be reached from \( a \) by adding \( c \) repeatedly.
   - Additionally, the program ensures that \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative, which is necessary because we can only consider positive steps in the sequence.

The logic correctly covers all cases described in the problem statement, including edge cases where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are at their limits. Thus, I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.
