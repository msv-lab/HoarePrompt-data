The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. This means that the updated value of `s` will reflect this change, while `res` remains as it was because thereâ€™s no specific operation affecting `res`. Therefore, after executing the code, we will express the changes made to `s`.

Output State: **`s` must still contain `char`, `s` is updated to include the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table, `res` is unchanged.**
