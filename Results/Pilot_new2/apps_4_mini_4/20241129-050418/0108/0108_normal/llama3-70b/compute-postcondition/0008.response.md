The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is 'a' and the value of `char` is also 'a'. Therefore, `res` becomes 'aa'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` must include 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
