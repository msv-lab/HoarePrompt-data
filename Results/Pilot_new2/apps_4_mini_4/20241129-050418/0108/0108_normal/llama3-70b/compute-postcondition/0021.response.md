To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `char in s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the state has `s` with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by `chr(ord(char) + 1)`, meaning that the character `char` in the string `s` has been incremented by 1 in its ASCII value. 

Now, since `res` includes `char`, it indicates that `char` is no longer present in `s` after this replacement, as it has been replaced. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `s` to contain `char` again after the replacement. This can only happen if the previous value of `s` had at least one occurrence of `char` and `char` has not already been exhausted from `s`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that `s` must still contain `char` after the modification. 

State: **`s` must include `char`, `res` includes `char`.**
