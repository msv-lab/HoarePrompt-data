The function accepts a string `s` which consists of lowercase English letters. It checks if `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order, and if so, it prints the complete alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` is missing any letters from 'a' to 'z' in the required sequence, the function indicates this by printing -1. The function does not return any value, and it operates on input read from the standard input.
