The variable `target` is assigned the value `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, which is a string containing all lowercase English letters in order. The variable `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, as it has only been assigned a new string from input but not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `target` now has a specific value while `s` retains its characteristics.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
