The variable `a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still constrained between 1 and 1000, but now `a` has taken on a new integer value based on user input.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `c` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000)**
