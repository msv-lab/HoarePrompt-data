The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. The parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. Since there is no specific output provided in the prompt, we cannot determine the exact return values of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, each ranging from 1 to 1000. The specific return value of the function is not defined in the provided information.**
