Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote based on the specified ratio of lemons to apples to pears (1:2:4). Hereâ€™s how it functions:

1. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, factoring in the limitations of apples and pears by using integer division: `b // 2` for apples (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon) and `c // 4` for pears (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).
2. It determines the minimum of these values along with the available lemons `a`, which gives the maximum number of lemons (`min_lemon`) that can be used in the compote.
3. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used in the compote, which is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, representing the total of lemons, apples, and pears.

Since the program handles all possibilities effectively, including edge cases where not enough fruits are available (leading to a result of 0), it meets the requirements stated in the problem description.
