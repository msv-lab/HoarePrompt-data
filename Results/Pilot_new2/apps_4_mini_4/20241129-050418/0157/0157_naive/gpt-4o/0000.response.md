To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and how it addresses the requirements.

The problem describes a scenario where Nikolay has a certain number of lemons, apples, and pears, and he wants to create a compote in the ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. We need to calculate the maximum total number of fruits he can use to follow this ratio.

### Code Analysis:
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes three inputs (number of lemons `a`, number of apples `b`, and number of pears `c`).

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available quantity of each fruit adhering to the specified ratios:
     - `a` lemons can be used as is.
     - `b // 2` gives the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with apples since each lemon requires 2 apples.
     - `c // 4` gives the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with pears since each lemon requires 4 pears.
   - The minimum of these three values is taken to ensure that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available quantities of apples and pears when considering the ratios.

3. **Calculating Total Fruits**:
   - The total number of fruits is then calculated by summing `max_lemons * 1` (for lemons), `max_lemons * 2` (for apples), and `max_lemons * 4` (for pears).

4. **Output**: The total fruits are printed.

### Validations:
Now, let's validate the program with the provided examples as well as edge cases:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `2, 5, 7` → Maximum usable fruits = `1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears = 7`. Output: `7` (Correct)

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `4, 7, 13` → Maximum usable fruits = `3 lemons + 6 apples + 12 pears = 21`. Output: `21` (Correct)

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `2, 3, 2` → Not enough pears for even 1 lemon (needs 4). Output: `0` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**:
   - Input: `1, 1, 1` → Not enough fruits to make the compote (needs at least 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears). Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Exact Fit**:
   - Input: `1, 2, 4` → Maximum usable fruits = `1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears = 7`. Output: `7` (Correct)

3. **Excess Fruits**:
   - Input: `10, 20, 40` → Maximum usable fruits = `10 lemons + 20 apples + 40 pears = 70`. Output: `70` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
All test cases, including edge cases, show that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use according to the given ratios. There are no instances found where the program fails to meet the expected criteria.

Correctness: **True**.
