The function accepts an integer input `s` (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) from the user and prints its English word representation. It handles numbers in three ranges: for `s` less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list; for `s` between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list; and for `s` 20 or greater, it constructs the word representation using the `tens` list and the `ones` list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. However, it assumes that the input will always be within the specified range and does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers or numbers greater than 99).
