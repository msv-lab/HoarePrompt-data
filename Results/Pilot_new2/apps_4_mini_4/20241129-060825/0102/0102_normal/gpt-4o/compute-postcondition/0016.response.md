Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` in the range from 0 to 99 and returns its English string representation. It returns the corresponding word for single digits (0-9), specific words for the 'teens' (11-19), the tens place for multiples of ten (10, 20, ..., 90), or a combination of the tens and ones place for numbers between 21 and 99 (except multiples of ten). It does not handle the case for `n = 10`, which should return "ten" but is not explicitly addressed in the code. **
