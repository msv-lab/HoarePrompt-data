The provided program aims to convert an integer score (from 0 to 99) into its English word representation. Let's analyze the program step by step to verify if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

1. **Handling Single Digits (0 to 9)**:
   - The function uses the `ones` list to return the corresponding string representation for integers from 0 to 9. This is correctly specified, and the return value is as expected.

2. **Handling Teen Numbers (11 to 19)**:
   - The function checks if the number falls between 11 and 19 and returns the correct string from the `teens` list. The condition correctly excludes 10 and handles the teens appropriately.

3. **Handling Tens (Multiples of 10 from 10 to 90)**:
   - For multiples of ten (10, 20, ..., 90), the program uses the `tens` list to return the correct representation. It explicitly checks if `n` is a multiple of 10 and returns the appropriate value.

4. **Handling Other Two-Digit Numbers (21 to 99, excluding multiples of ten)**:
   - For numbers that are not multiples of ten but fall between 21 and 99, the program correctly constructs the string by concatenating the tens and ones representations using a hyphen.

5. **Missing Case**:
   - The program correctly handles all cases from 0 to 99. However, it's notable that the comment in the code states that the function does not explicitly handle `n = 10`, but it does, since the first `if` statement checks for that case, and `ten` is returned from the `tens` list.

Considering all the above points:

- The function covers all integers in the specified range (0 to 99) and returns a string that aligns with the requirements of the problem description.
- The formatting of the output (using lowercase letters and hyphens without spaces) is also addressed by the function.

Thus, the program meets all the specified requirements effectively.

Correctness: **True**
