You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

You can find all you need to know about English numerals in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99.
def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven',
    'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    if (0 <= n <= 9) :
        return ones[n]
        #The program returns the string corresponding to the integer value of n, which is an element in the 'ones' list, where n is between 0 and 9 inclusive.
    else :
        if (11 <= n <= 19) :
            return teens[n - 10]
            #The program returns the string that corresponds to the value of n-10 from the 'teens' list, which includes the strings for numbers between 11 and 19 (inclusive).
        else :
            if (10 <= n <= 99) :
                if (n % 10 == 0) :
                    return tens[n // 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of the tens place of the integer n, where n is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, as determined by the tens list
                else :
                    return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of the number 'n' in the format 'tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]' where 'tens[n // 10]' corresponds to the tens place and 'ones[n % 10]' corresponds to the ones place of the integer 'n'.
            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; `ones` is a list containing the strings 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'; `teens` is a list containing the strings ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']; `tens` is a list containing the strings ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety'; `n` is an integer such that `n` is less than 10 or `n` is greater than 19.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; `ones` is a list containing the strings 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'; `teens` is a list containing the strings ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']; `tens` is a list containing the strings ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety'; `n` is an integer such that `n` is less than 10 or `n` is greater than 19.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
