Correctness: **True**.

The given program accurately converts an integer score (between 0 and 99) into its corresponding English word representation. 

- For scores less than 10, it correctly uses the `ones` list to map single-digit numbers to their word forms.
- For scores from 10 to 19, it correctly uses the `teens` list to convert teen numbers into words.
- For scores from 20 to 99, it uses the `tens` list for the tens place and combines it with the `ones` list for the units place, correctly formatting the output with a hyphen when necessary.

All examples provided in the problem description are handled appropriately by the program, and there are no edge cases that the program fails to address. Thus, it adheres to the requirements specified.
