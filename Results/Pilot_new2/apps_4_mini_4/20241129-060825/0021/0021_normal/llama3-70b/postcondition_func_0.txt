The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, adjusting for the total length of the list. It then prints the maximum value between this calculated distance and the distance of `n-1 - min_dist`, where `min_dist` is calculated similarly. The function does not return a value, but only prints the result.
