The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the split input string. The specific integers in `a` will depend on the input provided. However, `a` will contain `n` distinct integers that are each in the range from 1 to `n`. 

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. The input for the list must also conform to the condition that the integers are within the range of 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100\); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers within the range 1 to `n` based on input.**
