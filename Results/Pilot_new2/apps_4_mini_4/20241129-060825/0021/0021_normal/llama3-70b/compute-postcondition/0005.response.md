The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. The values of `pos1` and `posn` are the indices of the first occurrences of `1` and `n` in the list `a`, respectively. The expression `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` calculates the distance between these two indices minus one, and `n - 2` is a constant based on the value of `n`. The final value of `min_dist` will be the smaller of these two calculated values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers within the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is equal to `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
