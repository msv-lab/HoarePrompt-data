The variable `min_pos` is assigned the value of `a.index(1)`, which gives the index of the first occurrence of the value `1` in the list `a`. The precondition states that `a` consists of `n` distinct integers where each integer satisfies `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n`, ensuring that `1` is guaranteed to be present in the list. Thus, the value of `min_pos` will be the index of `1` in `a`, and it will be a valid index within the range of the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`.**
