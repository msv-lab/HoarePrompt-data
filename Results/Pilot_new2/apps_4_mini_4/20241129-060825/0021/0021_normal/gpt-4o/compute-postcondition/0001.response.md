`a` is assigned the value of a list containing `n` distinct integers, where each integer is obtained from the input and converted to an integer. The values of `a` will be distinct integers that fall within the range of 1 to `n`, and the previous state of `n` remains valid. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n` based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n` based on user input.**
