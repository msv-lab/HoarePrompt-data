The value of `max_distance` is calculated based on the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The `print()` function outputs the value of `max_distance`, but does not alter any variables. Therefore, the output state is that all the precondition variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`; `dist4` is equal to abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is equal to max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4); `max_distance` has been printed.**
