To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze what the program is doing in relation to the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The function must find the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the provided permutation.
2. It must calculate the maximum possible distance between these two elements after performing exactly one swap.
3. The distance between the two elements is defined as the absolute difference between their positions in the array.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the size of the array `n` and the permutation `a`.
  
2. **Finding Positions**: 
   - `min_pos = a.index(1)` correctly finds the position of the minimum element (1).
   - `max_pos = a.index(n)` correctly finds the position of the maximum element (n).

3. **Calculating Distances**:
   - The program calculates four potential distances:
     - `dist1`: The distance if the maximum element is moved to the start of the array (position 0).
     - `dist2`: The distance if the maximum element is moved to the end of the array (position n-1).
     - `dist3`: The distance if the minimum element is moved to the start of the array (position 0).
     - `dist4`: The distance if the minimum element is moved to the end of the array (position n-1).
   - The maximum of these distances is computed, which gives the maximum distance achievable after one swap.

4. **Output**: The program prints the maximum distance.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program successfully identifies the positions of the minimum and maximum elements.
- It explores the two extremes of the array (the first and last positions) to determine how far apart these two elements can be after one swap.
- The logic of calculating distances based on swapping the elements with the ends of the array correctly adheres to the problem's requirement to maximize the distance after a single swap.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic follows the problem description accurately. It correctly calculates the maximum possible distance that can be achieved by performing exactly one swap between the minimum and maximum elements.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
