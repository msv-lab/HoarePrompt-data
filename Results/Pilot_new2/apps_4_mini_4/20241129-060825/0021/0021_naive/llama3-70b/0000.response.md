To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it based on the problem description and the requirements.

The program is tasked with maximizing the distance between the indices of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) integers in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap. It calculates the current positions of the minimum and maximum integers, computes the distances, and then attempts to determine the maximum possible distance after a swap.

Hereâ€™s the relevant section of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)
posn = a.index(n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Finding Positions**: The program finds the positions of the integers 1 and n correctly.
2. **Calculating Distances**:
   - It calculates the absolute distance between the indices of 1 and n.
   - The line `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` appears to be trying to determine how far apart the two numbers can be after a swap. However, the logic used to compute the potential maximum distance is flawed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The calculation of `max_dist` is misleading. The value of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` does not correctly reflect the maximum distance achievable after a swap. The distance should simply be calculated based on the maximum potential indices (0 and n-1) after considering the swap.
2. **Ignoring Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the minimum and maximum integers are already at the ends. The distances may not be calculated correctly in such scenarios.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
For an input like:
```
3
1 2 3
```
- The positions would be `pos1 = 0` and `posn = 2`, with an initial distance of `2`.
- The expected maximum distance after swapping any middle value (which cannot be swapped with either min or max) would still yield `2`, but when using the formula provided, it incorrectly computes a value that does not reflect the reality of the array structure.

### Conclusion:
Due to the flawed logic in calculating the maximum achievable distance after a swap, as well as the failure to address potential edge cases, the program does not adhere to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
