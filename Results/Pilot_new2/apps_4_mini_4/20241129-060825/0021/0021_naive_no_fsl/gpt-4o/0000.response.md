To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program works and whether it accounts for all potential cases as described.

### Analyzing the Program:

1. The input consists of an integer `n`, followed by `n` distinct integers which form a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. The program determines the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (`n`) elements in the array.
3. It computes the distance to both ends of the array (0 and `n-1`) for both the minimum and maximum elements.
4. Finally, it calculates the maximum of those distances and prints it.

### Evaluation of Logic:

- The distances calculated in the program do not take into account the actual positions where the elements will end up after a swap. Instead, it only calculates distances from the ends of the array to the maximum and minimum positions.
- This could lead to incorrect results as it does not consider that the goal is to swap the two elements to maximize their distance.

### Counterexample:

Let's consider the input:
```
n = 4
a = [1, 4, 2, 3]
```
- The minimum element (1) is at index 0 and the maximum element (4) is at index 1.
- The expected output should be the maximum distance after one swap.
- The program calculates distances:
  - dist1 = abs(0 - 1) = 1 (distance from left end to max)
  - dist2 = abs(3 - 1) = 2 (distance from right end to max)
  - dist3 = abs(0 - 0) = 0 (distance from left end to min)
  - dist4 = abs(3 - 0) = 3 (distance from right end to min)
- The output will be `max(1, 2, 0, 3) = 3`, which is incorrect because after swapping 1 and 4, their positions would be [4, 1, 2, 3] and the distance would then be 1 which is less than the actual maximum distance achievable by a valid swap.

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the maximum distance after a swap.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to account for the actual positions and potential swaps necessary to reach the maximum distance, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
