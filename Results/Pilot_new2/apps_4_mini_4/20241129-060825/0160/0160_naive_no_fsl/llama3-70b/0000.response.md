Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to handle the constraints of the problem correctly. While it computes the GCD of the numbers in the array, it does not take into account the number of operations (K) that can be performed, which can significantly alter the elements of the array. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2 1
2 3
```
In this case, with K = 1, you can perform one operation such as choosing `i = 1` and `j = 2`. This operation would result in A = (3, 2). The GCD of these numbers is 1, but after the operation, it is clear that we could have also reached A = (1, 4) (by reversing the operation), which gives a GCD of 1 as well.

However, there are more significant scenarios where K allows for the manipulation of divisors:
For instance:
```
3 3
5 10 15
```
Here, we can perform operations to manipulate the values significantly. The maximum positive integer that could divide every element after allowed operations could be much larger than just using the GCD.

The program does not utilize K in its logic, nor does it explore how far values can be adjusted using up to K operations. Hence, it doesn't guarantee the correct maximum divisor that divides all elements post-manipulation according to the described operations in the problem statement. 

To summarize, the absence of handling for K's effect on A means the program cannot be considered correct.
