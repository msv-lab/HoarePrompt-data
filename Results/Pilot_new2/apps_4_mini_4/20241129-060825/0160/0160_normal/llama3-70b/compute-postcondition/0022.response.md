Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, and `gcd` is at least 4. If `gcd` is divisible by 2 and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of `max_divisor` and 2, while `i` remains 2. If `gcd` is not divisible by 2, no changes are made to `max_divisor` and `i`.***
