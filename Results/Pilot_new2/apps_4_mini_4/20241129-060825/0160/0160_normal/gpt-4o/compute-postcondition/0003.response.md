The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the set `divisors`. Given that `i` is initially 1 and divides `N` (which is within the range 2 to 500), it means that `1` is a divisor of `N`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where `x[0]` is N (2 <= N <= 500), `x[1]` is K (0 <= K <= 10^9), `x[2]` is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); `divisors` now contains the value {1}; `i` is 1; `sqrt(N)` is valid (N >= 2)**
