To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze both.

### Problem Description:
The program needs to compute the k-rounding of a positive integer `n`, which is defined as the minimum positive integer `x` such that:
1. `x` ends with `k` or more zeros in base 10.
2. `x` is divisible by `n`.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
The function defined in the annotated program is:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
```
Here’s the breakdown of what this function does:
1. **Calculate the multiplier:** `multiplier = 10 ** k` computes 10 raised to the power of `k`, which gives us a number that has `k` zeros at the end.
2. **Calculate `x`:** The `x` is calculated as `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. This step scales `n` by a factor that ensures it is divisible by `multiplier`.
   - The division `multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)` effectively adjusts the `n` in such a way that the resulting `x` will be the smallest integer that meets the two requirements of being divisible by `n` and having `k` trailing zeros.

### Verification of Requirements:
- **Divisibility by `n`:** The formula used ensures that `x` is a multiple of `n` because it’s directly scaled by `n`.
- **Ends with `k` zeros:** Since `multiplier` is `10^k`, and the adjustment through the gcd essentially ensures that `x` is not only divisible by `n` but also makes sure that it has at least `k` trailing zeros.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem as it scales `n` appropriately and ensures that `x` meets both conditions (being divisible by `n` and ending with at least `k` zeros).

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:
Correctness: **True**
