The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). After executing the function body, it returns the value of `x`, which is calculated as \(n\) multiplied by (multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of \(n\) and multiplier). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return a value based on the specified formula involving these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer) and k (a non-negative integer), and returns the value of x calculated as n multiplied by (multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of n and multiplier).**
