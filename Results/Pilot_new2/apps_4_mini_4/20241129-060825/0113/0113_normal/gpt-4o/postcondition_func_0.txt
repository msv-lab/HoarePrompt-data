The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k ≤ 8), and returns the value of `x`, which is calculated as `n` multiplied by `(10^k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10^k)`. This effectively scales `n` by a factor determined by `k`, taking into account the greatest common divisor to ensure the multiplication is appropriate without excessive factors.
