The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as indicated by its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8. The function returns results based on these constraints and relationships. 

Since the specific output behavior is not detailed, I cannot define any cases for the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle operations involving the positive integer `n` and the non-negative integer `k`, but specifics on the return values cannot be determined without further information.

Functionality: **The function operates with a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), but does not return any specific values without further detail on the output behavior.**
