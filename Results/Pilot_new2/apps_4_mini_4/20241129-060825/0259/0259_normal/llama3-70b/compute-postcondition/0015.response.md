To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables.

1. We start with the initial state where:
   - `n` is between 1 and 100.
   - `buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form (s, d).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`.
   - `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`.

2. The code snippet updates the variable `time` using the expression `(t - s) % d`. This means `time` will now hold the result of the calculation `(t - s) % d`.

3. Importantly, the values of `n`, `buses`, `i`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged. The only variable that is updated is `time`.

4. The output state needs to reflect the unchanged variables and include the new value of `time`, which is defined as `(t - s) % d`.

Given this analysis, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form (s, d), `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`.**
