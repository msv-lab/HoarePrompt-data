The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from user input, which is split into two integers. The values of `s` and `d` will depend on the user's input, but they will be positive integers. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is a positive integer (user input), `d` is a positive integer (user input).

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is a positive integer (user input), `d` is a positive integer (user input)**.
