The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, where each `s` is a positive integer (user input), and each `d` is a positive integer (user input); `min_time` is float('inf'), `ans` is -1.
