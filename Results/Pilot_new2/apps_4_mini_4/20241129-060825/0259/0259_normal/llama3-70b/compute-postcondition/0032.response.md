The function `func` accepts several parameters: `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, representing the number of bus routes. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, representing a time value. For each bus route indexed by `i` (where 1 <= i <= n), `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers between 1 and 100000, representing the start and destination points of each bus route, respectively. 

The function processes these inputs and returns the results based on the defined logic for the bus routes and time values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 100), t (a positive integer between 1 and 100000), and for each bus route i, s_i and d_i (positive integers between 1 and 100000), and returns outputs based on the processing of these bus routes and time values.**
