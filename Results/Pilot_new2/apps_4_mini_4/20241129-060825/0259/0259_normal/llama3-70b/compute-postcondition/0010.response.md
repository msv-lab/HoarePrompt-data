The `buses` list has a tuple `(s, d)` appended to it. The variables `s` and `d` are both positive integers based on the previous state and there is no change to the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be greater than 1; `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000; `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000; `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000; `buses` now contains one additional tuple `(s, d)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000; `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000; `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000; `buses` contains one additional tuple `(s, d)`**.
