`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form (s, d), `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, `time` is equal to (t - s) % d, `min_time` is equal to `time`, `current value of time` is less than `min_time`, and `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form (s, d), `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, `time` is equal to (t - s) % d, `min_time` is equal to `time`, `current value of time` is less than `min_time`, `ans` is 1**.
