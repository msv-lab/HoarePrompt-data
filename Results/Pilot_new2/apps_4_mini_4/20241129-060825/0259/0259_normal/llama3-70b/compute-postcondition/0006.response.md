The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from user input, which are converted to integers. The values of `s` and `d` will now represent the user's input values. The other variables retain their previous states. The output will reflect the updated values of `s` and `d` based on user input. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is a positive integer (user input), `d` is a positive integer (user input)**.
