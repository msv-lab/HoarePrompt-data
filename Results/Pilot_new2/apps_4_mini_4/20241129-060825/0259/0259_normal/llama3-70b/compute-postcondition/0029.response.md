Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100; `buses` is a list containing at least 3 tuples of the form (s, d); `i` is 2; `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`; `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`; `time` is assigned the value `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is equal to `time` and `ans` is 3.***
