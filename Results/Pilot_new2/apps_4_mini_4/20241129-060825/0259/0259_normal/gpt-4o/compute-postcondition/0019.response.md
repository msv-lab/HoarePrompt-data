The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is taken from `bus_routes[1]`, and `t` is not specified in the initial state, but it is assumed to hold a specific value. Consequently, `wait_time` will depend on the value of `s_i` and `t`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[1], wait_time = s_i - t.**
