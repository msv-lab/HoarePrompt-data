`wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The variable `d_i` remains unchanged, and since `s_i` is assigned a value from `bus_routes[1]`, its specific value is also retained. The variables `n` and `i` are unchanged as well.

The calculation for `wait_time` uses the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. Therefore, `wait_time` will be determined based on those values, but its specific value cannot be determined without specific values for `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, and both `s_i` and `d_i` hold specific values, we maintain that information in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is a value from `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is a value from `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
