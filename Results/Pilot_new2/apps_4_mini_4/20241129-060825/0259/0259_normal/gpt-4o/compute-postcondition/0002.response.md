According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`, which is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop and iterates up to `n - 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The provided state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, so it satisfies this condition.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized at 0. Other variables like `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but they may change during the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1**
