Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with `i` equal to 0. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is set to 1, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged and `chosen_route` stays at -1.***
