In the given code snippet, the values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned based on the input received. Since `n`, `m`, and `r` are all positive integers within specified ranges, their values will be updated based on the input. The lists `s` and `b` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code executed.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000); `s` is a list of n integers where each integer si represents the price of shares (1 <= si <= 1000), and `b` is a list of m integers where each integer bi represents the selling price of shares (1 <= bi <= 1000).**
