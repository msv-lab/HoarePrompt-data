Postcondition: ***`shares` is the total number of shares obtained using the original value of `r`, `i` is the previous value incremented by 1, and `m` is greater than `i + 1`. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is incremented by `shares * b[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
