The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained from `input()` and transformed into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since we donâ€™t know the specific integer values provided through input, we cannot change the ranges defined in the initial state. The other variables (`s` and `b`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `r` have been assigned new values based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers where each `s[i]` (1 <= `s[i]` <= 1000), and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each `b[i]` (1 <= `b[i]` <= 1000).**
