The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is the total number of shares obtained using the original value of `r`, `i` is the previous value incremented by 1, `m` is greater than `previous i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
