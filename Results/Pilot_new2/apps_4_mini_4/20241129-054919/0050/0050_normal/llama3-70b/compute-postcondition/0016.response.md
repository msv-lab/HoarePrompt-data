The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order with at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is the previous value of `shares`, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
