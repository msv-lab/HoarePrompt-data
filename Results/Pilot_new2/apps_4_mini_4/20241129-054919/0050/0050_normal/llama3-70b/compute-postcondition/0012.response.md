Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `r` is updated to the previous value of `r` modulo `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`, and `i` remains 0. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then `shares` remains 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
