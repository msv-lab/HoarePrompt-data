Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `m` is between 1 and 30, if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[2]`, then `r` is updated to `r % s[2]`, `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[2])`, and `i` remains 2. Otherwise, `r` is between 0 and `s[1] - 1`, `shares` remains unchanged, and `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
