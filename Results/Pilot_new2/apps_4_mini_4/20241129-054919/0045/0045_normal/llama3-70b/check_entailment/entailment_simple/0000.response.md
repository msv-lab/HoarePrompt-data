Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The program only computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, `n` and `k`, but it does not generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` with a maximal GCD.

Here are the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Lack of Sequence Generation**: The problem description requires generating a sequence of `k` numbers whose sum equals `n` and has the maximum GCD. However, the annotated program only calculates the GCD of `n` and `k`, without constructing the required sequence.

2. **Missing Conditions**: The program does not check for the feasibility of creating a sequence. For example, if `n` is less than the sum of the first `k` positive integers (i.e., `k * (k + 1) / 2`), it should return `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to form such a sequence. The program does not implement this logic.

3. **No Output Format**: The output of the program is only the GCD and does not align with the required output format of returning either the sequence or `-1`.

Due to these deficiencies, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
