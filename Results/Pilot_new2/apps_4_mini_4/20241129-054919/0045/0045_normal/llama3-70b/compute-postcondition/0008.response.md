The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return their greatest common divisor (GCD). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).**
