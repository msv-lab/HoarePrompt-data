To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the final outcomes based on the provided initial state and the loop's behavior.

Given the loop:
```
for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
    if remainder == 0:
        break
    sequence[i] += 1
    remainder -= 1
```

After executing the loop:

1. The loop continues until `remainder` becomes 0 or until it has iterated through all indices of the `sequence` list from `k - 1` to `0`.
2. Each iteration increments `sequence[i]` by 1 and decrements `remainder` by 1.
3. If `remainder` was initially greater than `k`, it could be decremented down to 0 and affect multiple indices in `sequence`.

Now let's consider the final values of the variables:

- If `remainder` is 0 before the loop starts, the loop does not execute at all, and thus `sequence` remains unchanged, and `remainder` stays the same.
- If the loop executes fully until `remainder` reaches 0, each of the last `remainder` indices of `sequence` will have been incremented by 1.

Thus, we can state that after all iterations:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `remainder` is 0; `sequence` contains values that are incremented from their original values according to the number of times the loop executed, specifically the last `original_remainder` indices of `sequence` have been incremented by 1, where `original_remainder` is the initial value of `remainder`.**
