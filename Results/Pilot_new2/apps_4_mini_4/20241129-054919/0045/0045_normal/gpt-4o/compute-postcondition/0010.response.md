Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10. If `remainder` equals 0, then `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - (n // min_sum) * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, while the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
