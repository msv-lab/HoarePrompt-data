Correctness: **False**

The program does not implement the requirements of the problem description as it simply calculates the absolute difference between the two side lengths \( x \) and \( y \). 

The problem requires calculating the minimum number of modifications needed to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) into one of side length \( y \) while ensuring that at each step the triangle remains non-degenerate (meaning all sides must be positive integers). The approach described in the problem involves gradually reducing the side lengths in a controlled manner to maintain the triangle's properties, while the program only outputs the difference between \( x \) and \( y \).

For example, for the input `6 3`, the correct output should be `4`, as shown in the example in the problem description, but the program would incorrectly output `3` (the absolute difference). 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem and cannot be considered correct.
