The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the number of steps needed to move from `y` to `x`, taking into account whether the difference is even or odd. The variable `z` (not explicitly defined in the initial state) will be assigned this computed value.

Since `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the difference `x - y` is guaranteed to be a positive integer. Therefore, `x - y` is at least 1. The output of `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of pairs of steps, while `(x - y) % 2` checks for an additional step needed if the difference is odd.

The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects the new calculation and the existing conditions.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000; x` and `y` are integers assigned from input values; `z` is equal to `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.**
