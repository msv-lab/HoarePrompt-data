The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It calculates the number of ways to choose `k` items from a set of size `2^n` modulo `1000003`. If `k` exceeds `2^n`, it prints `1 1` and returns without further computation. The calculation involves the product of decreasing values from `2^n` for `k` iterations and does not return a value; instead, it prints the result.
