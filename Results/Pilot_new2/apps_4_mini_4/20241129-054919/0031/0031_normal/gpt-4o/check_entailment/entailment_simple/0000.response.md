To determine the correctness of the provided program concerning the problem description, let's analyze what the program is intended to do and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Summary:
ZS the Coder is interested in the probability that at least two out of `k` people share a birthday in a year that has `2^n` days. The output should be the irreducible fraction `A/B` representing this probability, reduced modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Program Breakdown:
1. **GCD Calculation**: 
   - The program defines `func_1(a, b)` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This is used to simplify the fraction `A/B`.

2. **Main Logic** (`func_2(n, k)`):
   - **Input Handling**: Checks if `k > 2^n`. If true, outputs `1 1`, indicating that there is a guarantee of a shared birthday.
   - **Probability Calculation**: 
     - Initializes `total_days` as `2^n`.
     - Calculates the probability of no shared birthdays (denoted by the product of available birthdays as people are added) and the total possible combinations (denoted by `total_days^k`).
     - Computes the shared birthday probability as the difference from the total combinations.
   - **Fraction Reduction**: The probability is reduced using GCD to yield the irreducible fraction `A/B`.
   - Outputs the final values of `A` and `B`, taking modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Evaluation Against the Requirements:
- **Case Handling**: The program correctly identifies when `k` exceeds the number of available days, returning `1 1` as required.
- **Probability Computation**: The loop correctly calculates the numerator (ways to choose birthdays without sharing) and denominator (total configurations).
- **Irreducibility**: Uses the GCD function effectively to ensure `A` and `B` are coprime before taking modulo.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`) through its logic without running into limitations in Python since Python handles large integers natively.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to all specified requirements from the problem description. It correctly computes the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday and returns the results in the required format.

Thus, the final evaluation of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
