`total_days` is assigned the value `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2^n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, the value of `total_days` becomes `2^n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and `k` is less than or equal to 1 shifted left by `n` (k ≤ 2^n); `total_days` is equal to `2^n`.**
