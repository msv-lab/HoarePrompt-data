To calculate the new value of `numerator`, we need to look at the expression provided in the code. 

1. The `total_days` is `2^n`, and thus `total_days - i` becomes `2^n - 1` since `i` is initialized to `1`.
2. The current value of `numerator` is `(2^n) % 1000003`.

Now we can substitute these values into the expression:
- `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`
- `numerator = (2^n % 1000003) * ((2^n) - 1) % 1000003`

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `MOD`, `denominator`, `i`) remain unchanged in this execution. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, `numerator` is equal to `((2^n) % 1000003) * ((2^n) - 1) % 1000003`, `denominator` is equal to `(2^n) % 1000003`, `i` is 1**
