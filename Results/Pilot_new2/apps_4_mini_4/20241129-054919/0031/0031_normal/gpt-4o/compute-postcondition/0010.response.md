The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is equal to `2^n`. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` will be `(1 * (2^n)) % 1000003`, which simplifies to `(2^n) % 1000003`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, `numerator` is equal to `(2^n) % 1000003`, `denominator` is equal to `(2^n) % 1000003`, `i` is 0**
