To determine the necessary adjustments to the states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the variables involved in the for loop.

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `k`. Since `i` is initialized to 1 and iterates up to `k`, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To execute one more time, we increment `i` by 1.
3. After the next increment, `i` will be 2.
4. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2 (since `i` starts from 0 in the range and would take values 0 to k-1).

Given these considerations, the following state adjustments are necessary for the next iteration:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than 2, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is equal to \(2^n \cdot (2^n - 1)\), `denominator` is equal to \(2^{2n}\), `i` is 2**
