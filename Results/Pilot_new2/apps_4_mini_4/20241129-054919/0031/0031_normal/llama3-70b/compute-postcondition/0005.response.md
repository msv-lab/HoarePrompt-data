The variable `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), which means `denominator` will be updated to \(1 \times 2^n\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is equal to \(2^n\), `denominator` is equal to \(2^n\), `i` is 0.**
