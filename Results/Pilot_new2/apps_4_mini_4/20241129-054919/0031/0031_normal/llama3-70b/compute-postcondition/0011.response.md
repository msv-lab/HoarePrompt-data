The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. Since `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), the new value of `denominator` will be equal to its previous value multiplied by \(2^n\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than 2, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is equal to \((2^n \cdot (2^n - 1)) \times (2^n - 2)\), `denominator` is equal to \(2^{2n}\) multiplied by \(2^n\) (which is \(2^{2n + n} = 2^{3n}\)), `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than 2, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is equal to \((2^n \cdot (2^n - 1)) \times (2^n - 2)\), `denominator` is equal to \(2^{3n}\), `i` is 2.**
