Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculates the number of ways to select `k` distinct items from a set of size \(2^n\) using combinatorial logic, and returns the numerator and denominator of that calculation, both reduced by their greatest common divisor (gcd), modulo \(10^6 + 3\). **
