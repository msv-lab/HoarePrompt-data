To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and potential edge cases.

### Problem Understanding
The program is required to calculate the probability that at least two out of `k` people share the same birthday in a year with `2^n` days. The results must be given in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where both \( A \) and \( B \) must be coprime and outputted modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Handling Cases Where k > 2^n**: 
   - The code properly checks if `k > 2^n`. In such cases, it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, so it prints `1 1`. This is correct.

2. **Calculating Numerator and Denominator**:
   - The calculation of the total days as `total_days = 1 << n` is correct because \( 1 << n \) computes \( 2^n \).
   - The program then computes the probability of no shared birthdays and the total probability, which is mathematically sound based on the Birthday Paradox.

3. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The GCD function is used correctly to ensure that \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime before taking the remainder with \( 10^6 + 3 \).

4. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The modulo operations are used to manage large numbers throughout the computation.

### Potential Edge Cases
- **Minimum Values**: 
   - For \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 2 \), the 2 days would yield a probability calculation that should return \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) as the irreducible fraction.
  
- **Maximum Values**: 
   - Given the constraints of \( n \) and \( k \) up to \( 10^{18} \), it is important that the program handles these large integers correctly. Python's integer type can handle large integers, but we should check if overflow can occur during the probability calculations. The Python code seems to use modulo consistently, which prevents overflow as it keeps the values manageable.

- **Boundary Case**: 
   - For \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 3 \), the code correctly outputs \( 1 1 \) as there are not enough days for the people (same reasoning as before).
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 4 \), the probability should lead to a valid fraction.

### Conclusion
After examining the program with the provided problem description and understanding its logic, the program appears to handle all edge cases appropriately and gives the correct irreducible fraction output in all scenarios presented. Therefore, I cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected.

The final determination of correctness based on the inputs analyzed is:

Correctness: **True**
