Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, then the current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function checks their values: if `a` is less than `b`, the string `<` has been printed; otherwise, the string `>` has been printed.***
