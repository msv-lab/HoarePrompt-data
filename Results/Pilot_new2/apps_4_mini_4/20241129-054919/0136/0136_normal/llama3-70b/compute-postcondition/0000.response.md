The value of `a` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means all leading zeros from the input string are removed. Since `a` is a string containing non-negative integers, after executing this line, `a` will be either an empty string (if the original input was all zeros) or the input string without leading zeros. The variable `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string (unchanged)**.
