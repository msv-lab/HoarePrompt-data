Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a flaw in its logic regarding the handling of leading zeroes. While the program correctly strips leading zeroes from the input strings `a` and `b` before comparing them, it fails to adequately handle the case where both numbers are '0' after leading zeroes have been removed.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the issue:

1. The `input().lstrip('0')` operation removes leading zeroes, which is correct for comparison purposes. However, if the input consists entirely of zeroes (e.g., "0000"), `lstrip('0')` will result in an empty string for that number.

2. The comparison `if (a == b):` may yield unexpected results if both `a` and `b` were originally zero. After removing leading zeroes, both `a` and `b` would become empty strings, and the comparison would incorrectly be considered equal, leading to an output of '=' when the correct output should not include the comparison of empty strings.

3. A specific case that demonstrates the flaw: 
   - Input:
     ```
     0000
     0000
     ```
   - After processing, both `a` and `b` become empty strings `''`, and the comparison `a == b` will yield `True`, resulting in an incorrect output of '=' instead of the expected output.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle edge cases related to all-zero inputs and leading zero handling, which violates the requirements of the problem description.

To fix this, the program should check if the stripped strings are empty and handle them as '0' accordingly before performing any comparisons.
