The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each of which can contain no more than \(10^6\) digits, and may include leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the two integers represented by `a` and `b` as a string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and return their sum as a string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, and returns their sum as a string.**
