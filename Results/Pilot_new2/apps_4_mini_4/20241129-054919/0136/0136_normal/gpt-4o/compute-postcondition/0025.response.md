Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output printed is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, then if `a` is less than `b`, the output '<' is printed; if `a` is equal to `b`, the output '=' is printed; and if `a` is greater than `b`, the output '>' is printed. Additionally, if `a` is '0', then `b` is set to '0' and `data` remains unchanged; if `a` is not '0', then `b` and `data` remain unchanged. The length of `a` is always greater than or equal to the length of `b`.***
