Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, represented as strings, and compares them. It prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. It also handles leading zeros in the input by stripping them off, ensuring that both `a` and `b` are correctly compared even when they are represented with leading zeros. If both inputs are empty or consist only of leading zeros, they are treated as '0'. **
