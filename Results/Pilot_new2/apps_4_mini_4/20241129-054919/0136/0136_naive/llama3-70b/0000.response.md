Correctness: **False**.

The program has a potential issue with the handling of cases where both integers are zero, represented as "0". When both inputs are "0", the program will strip the leading zeros, resulting in both `a` and `b` being empty strings after the `lstrip('0')` operation. This will lead to a comparison of two empty strings, which will incorrectly evaluate as `a < b`, producing an output of "<", while the correct output should be "=". 

For example:
Input:
```
0
0
```
Output produced by the code:
```
<
```

Expected output:
```
=
``` 

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.
