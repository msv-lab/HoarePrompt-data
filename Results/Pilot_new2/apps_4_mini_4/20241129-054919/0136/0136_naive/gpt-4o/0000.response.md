Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where both numbers are zero correctly. While it strips leading zeroes and then checks if either number is empty (indicating that they are both zero), it does not explicitly handle the case of both inputs being zero. For example, if the input is:

```
0000
0000
```

The expected output should be `=` since both numbers are equal. However, in this case, the program would strip both inputs to empty strings and then assign `a` and `b` to `'0'`, leading to a correct comparison in this particular case. 

However, if we consider a different test case where one number is a valid number and the other is `0000`, the logic remains consistent. For example:

```
0000
0001
```

This should yield `<`, which is handled correctly. However, the entire logic can lead to confusion based on the handling of edge cases with leading zeroes, especially since no test cases were provided for direct equality when both are zeroed.

Thus, the overall logic around leading zeroes and the edge case of both being zero ultimately leads to potential misunderstandings, causing the correctness to be considered false in strict adherence to the problem description.
