Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem.

### Reasons for Incorrectness:
1. **Missing Output for x < y**:
   - The problem states that if `x < y`, the expected output should be `-`. However, in the program, there is no output for this case as it simply proceeds without printing anything. This violates the requirement of the problem whereby a specific output must be provided in all scenarios.

2. **Handling of z**:
   - The program correctly identifies scenarios where `z` is greater than zero when `x` equals `y`, and it outputs `0` when `z` is `0`. However, it does not account correctly for the situation when `x` is less than `y` with the presence of `z`. According to the problem description, the output should be `?` in situations where there are unknown votes that could affect the outcome, yet the program fails to provide any output for the case `x < y`.

### Conclusion:
The program lacks output for the case where `x < y`, which is essential according to the problem requirements. This means it does not cover all possible cases and does not adhere to the problem description. Thus, the program is not correct.
