The function accepts three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are read from input. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`. If `x` is less than `y`, it does not print anything. If `x` is equal to `y`, it prints '0' if `z` is 0; otherwise, it prints '?'. If `x` is greater than `y` but not equal to it, it prints '?'. The function has no return value and should handle the case where `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers within the specified range.
