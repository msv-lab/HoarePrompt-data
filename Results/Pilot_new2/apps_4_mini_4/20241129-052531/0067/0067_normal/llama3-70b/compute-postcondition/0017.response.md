Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the output is '+'; otherwise, if `x` is less than `y`, there is no specific output. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and if `x` equals `y`, then if `z` is 0, '0' is printed; otherwise, a question mark '?' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the program does not print anything specific.***
