The code `print('?')` does not change any variable values or the state of the program except for printing a character to the output. Therefore, the initial conditions remain intact and no variables are modified.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`; `x` is greater than or equal to `y`; and `x` is not equal to `y`**.
