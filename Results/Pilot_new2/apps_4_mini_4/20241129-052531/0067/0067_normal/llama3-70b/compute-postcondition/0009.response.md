The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '0'. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` do not change as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement was executed without any modification to the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`.

Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, `y` is non-negative, `z` is 0, and '0' has been printed.**
