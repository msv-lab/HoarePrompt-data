The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged while the value of `min_downvotes` now reflects the value of `y`. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.**
