The code provided is simply a print statement that outputs a string ('-') to the console. It does not modify any of the variables or affect the state in any way. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid and unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `y` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `z` is an integer in the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`; printed '-'**
