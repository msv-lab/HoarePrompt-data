To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function against the requirements defined in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Inputs**: The program receives three integers: `x`, `y`, and `z` which represent the number of guaranteed upvotes (`x`), guaranteed downvotes (`y`), and unknown votes (`z`).
2. **Outputs**: The program should print:
   - `"+"` if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes,
   - `"-"` if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes,
   - `"0"` if they are equal,
   - `"?"` if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

### Logic in the Program:
The program calculates:
- `min_upvotes` as `x` (the guaranteed upvotes),
- `max_upvotes` as `x + z` (all unknown votes could be upvotes),
- `min_downvotes` as `y` (the guaranteed downvotes),
- `max_downvotes` as `y + z` (all unknown votes could be downvotes).

The conditions checked in the program are:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it concludes that downvotes are greater and prints `"-"`.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it concludes that upvotes are greater and prints `"+"`.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `"?"`, indicating uncertainty.

### Evaluation:
- **Case 1**: If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which is `y`), it implies there is no case where upvotes can exceed downvotes. Thus the program correctly outputs `"-"`.
  
- **Case 2**: If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), it means downvotes can never equal or exceed upvotes, and hence the program correctly outputs `"+"`.

- **Case 3**: If both conditions are false, it implies that there is sufficient overlap where the outcome could vary based on how the unknown votes (`z`) are distributed. The correct output in this case is `"?"`, indicating uncertainty.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the conditions laid out in the problem description, and it accounts for all provided scenarios based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Thus, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
