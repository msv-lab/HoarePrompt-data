To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the program against the given requirements and examples.

The program takes three integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) as inputs, representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively.

### Breakdown of Logic:
1. If \( x > y + z \):
   - The program outputs `+`, indicating that there will definitely be more upvotes than downvotes.
   
2. If \( x < y \):
   - The program outputs `-`, indicating that there will definitely be more downvotes than upvotes.
   
3. If \( x == y \):
   - If \( z == 0 \), it outputs `0`, indicating equal votes with no unknown votes.
   - If \( z > 0 \), it outputs `?`, indicating uncertainty because the outcome could change depending on how the unknown voters vote.
   
4. If none of the above conditions match:
   - It outputs `?`, which would be the case where the number of upvotes is less than or equal to the number of downvotes while accounting for unknown votes.

### Checking Against Examples:
- **Example 1**: Input: `3 7 0` → Output: `-`
  - Correct, since \( 3 < 7 \).
  
- **Example 2**: Input: `2 0 1` → Output: `+`
  - Correct, since \( 2 > 0 \) regardless of the unknown vote.

- **Example 3**: Input: `1 1 0` → Output: `0`
  - Correct, since \( 1 == 1 \) and \( z = 0 \).

- **Example 4**: Input: `0 0 1` → Output: `?`
  - Correct, because there is uncertainty when there is one unknown voter.

### Finding Edge Cases:
Now, let's consider the edge cases and any potential inputs where the program might fail to meet the description:

#### Edge Case 1: Equal Upvotes and Downvotes with Unknowns
- Input: `1 1 1`
  - The expectation is that there could be one more upvote or downvote based on how the unknown votes are cast. Therefore, the program should return `?`.
  - The program will evaluate \( x == y \) (true), and since \( z > 0 \), it outputs `?` which is correct.

#### Edge Case 2: All Votes Unknown
- Input: `0 0 100`
  - Here, all votes are unknown, and we cannot determine whether the result would be up, down, or neutral. Hence, it should return `?`.
  - The program will evaluate \( x == y \) (true), and since \( z > 0 \), it outputs `?` which is correct.

#### Edge Case 3: No Upvotes, Downvotes with Unknowns
- Input: `0 5 0`
  - The program should return `-` since there are no upvotes and 5 downvotes, which matches the expectation.
  
#### Edge Case 4: Downvotes with Unknowns Leading to Zero
- Input: `3 3 3`
  - Here, it can lead to a scenario where there can be equal votes if all unknowns are upvotes or downvotes.
  - The program evaluates \( x == y \) (true), and since \( z > 0 \), it outputs `?` which is correct.

After considering these cases, every possible input scenario seems to be handled correctly by the program. Hence, it satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem requirements and outputs the expected results, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
