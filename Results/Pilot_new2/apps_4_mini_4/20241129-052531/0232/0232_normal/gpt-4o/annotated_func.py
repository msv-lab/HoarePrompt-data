#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), colors is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and k is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers for each color such that 1 ≤ ∑(k_i) ≤ n.
def func_1(n, m, colors, k):
    desired_counts = dict(zip(range(1, m + 1), k))
    current_counts = defaultdict(int)
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        current_counts[colors[right]] += 1
        
        while all(current_counts[color] >= desired_counts[color] for color in
            desired_counts):
            if all(current_counts[color] == desired_counts[color] for color in
                desired_counts):
                return 'YES'
            current_counts[colors[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `left` is the final position after processing all colors, `right` is equal to `n`, `current_counts` satisfies the condition that for each color in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]`, `colors` is the original list of colors.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that the desired counts of colors are not met in the current counts.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts positive integers `n` and `m`, a list of colors of length `n`, and a list `k` representing desired counts for `m` colors. It checks if it's possible to find a contiguous subarray of `colors` such that the counts of each color within that subarray match the desired counts specified in `k`. If such a subarray exists, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function does not consider cases where `k` may not sum to `n`, as it only checks the counts within existing subarrays.
