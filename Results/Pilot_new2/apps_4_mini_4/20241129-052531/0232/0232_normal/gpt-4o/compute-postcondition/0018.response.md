Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` must be greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]` after the decrease. If all current_counts match the desired_counts, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the condition for current_counts and desired_counts is satisfied after the decrease.***
