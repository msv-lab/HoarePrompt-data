Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` must still be greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]` after the decrease. If all current_counts match the desired_counts, the program returns 'YES'.**
