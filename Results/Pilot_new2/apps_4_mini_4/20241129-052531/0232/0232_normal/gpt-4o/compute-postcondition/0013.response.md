Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers. If all current_counts[color] equal desired_counts[color] for every color, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the loop's condition for execution is satisfied where at least one current_counts[color] is still less than desired_counts[color].***
