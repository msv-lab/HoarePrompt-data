Postcondition: ***`left` is adjusted to be between 1 and `n + 1`, `right` is 2, and `current_counts` is adjusted such that for each color in `desired_counts`, the current counts match the desired counts. If all current counts of the colors are equal to their corresponding desired counts, the program returns 'YES' indicating sufficiency of the current counts.***
