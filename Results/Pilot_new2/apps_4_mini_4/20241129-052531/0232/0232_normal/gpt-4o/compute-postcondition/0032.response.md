Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the original value of `n` + 1, `right` is 1, and `current_counts` has at least one color less than its corresponding value in `desired_counts`. If all elements of `current_counts` are equal to their corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES', indicating it is possible to adjust the current counts to meet the desired counts, since not all elements are equal and at least one color can still meet its desired count.***
