Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `found` is True if there exists a window in `colors` that matches the counts in the `counts` list, otherwise `found` is False. `window_counts` contains counts of colors from the `colors` list corresponding to the last evaluated window when `found` is True or remains empty if `found` is False. `i` is the index of the first window where a match was found, or equals `n` if no match was found.**
