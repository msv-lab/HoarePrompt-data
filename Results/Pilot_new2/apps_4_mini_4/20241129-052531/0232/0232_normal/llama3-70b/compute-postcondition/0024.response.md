The code assigns `0` to `window_counts[color]`. The variable `color` is assigned from `colors[j]`, and its current value is not in `window_counts`. This means that after executing the code, `window_counts` will now include the key `color` with a value of `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, `color` is now in `window_counts` with a value of `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, `color` is now in `window_counts` with a value of `0`.**
