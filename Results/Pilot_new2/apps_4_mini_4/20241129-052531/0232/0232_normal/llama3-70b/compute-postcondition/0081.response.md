The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `window_counts` contains colors corresponding to the last `n - 1` indices in the `colors` list, with their counts reflecting how many times each color appears in that window; `found` is True, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts` when sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
