Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
