The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is now 1 if `color` was previously not in `window_counts`, or it is now 2 if `color` was already in `window_counts`, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
