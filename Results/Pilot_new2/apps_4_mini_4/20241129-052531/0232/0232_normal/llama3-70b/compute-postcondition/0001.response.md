The variable `colors` is assigned a list of integers, which are obtained from user input and converted from strings to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n` and `m` do not directly change based on this line of code, but the input will result in a list of integers that can potentially be between 1 and 100, as specified by the initial conditions for `n`. Therefore, `colors` will hold a list of integers, but the specific integers depend on user input. 

The states of `n` and `m` do not change, but the conditions indicate that `m` is still between 1 and `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `m` is an integer between 1 and n; `colors` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**
