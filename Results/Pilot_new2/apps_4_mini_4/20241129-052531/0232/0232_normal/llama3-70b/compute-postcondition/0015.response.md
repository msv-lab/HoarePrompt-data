Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing at least 3 integers, `color` is the third element in the `colors` list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from user input. If `color` is not present in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is now set to 0. If `color` is already a key in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
