Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `color` is `colors[3]`, and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or incremented by 1 from its previous value. If all counts in `window_counts` match their respective targets from `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
