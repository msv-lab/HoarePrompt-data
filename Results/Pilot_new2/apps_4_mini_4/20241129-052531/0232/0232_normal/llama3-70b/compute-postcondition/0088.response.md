The variable `window_counts` is updated to set the count of `color` to 0. The value of `color` is determined by `colors[n - 1]`, and it is established that `color` is not currently in `window_counts`. Therefore, after executing the code, the count for `color` in `window_counts` will be initialized to 0. The other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `color` is `colors[n - 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is 0.**
