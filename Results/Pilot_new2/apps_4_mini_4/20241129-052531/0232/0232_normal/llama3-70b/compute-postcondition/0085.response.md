According to the code, the loop will execute if the value of `i` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is between 1 and 100 and `i` is currently 2, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 3 (since `i` starts at 2). Additionally, the variable `j` is set to `n - 1`, so for the loop to execute, `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`, which means `n` must be at least 3.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we have the following conditions:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- At the start of the loop, `i` is 2, and `j` is `n - 1` (which will be at least 2 if `n` is 3).

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`**
