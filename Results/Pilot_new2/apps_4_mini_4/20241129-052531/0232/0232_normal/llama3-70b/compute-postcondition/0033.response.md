The variable `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. Previously, it had the value of `1`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `color` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is now 0.**
