Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `color` is `colors[n - 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1. If all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
