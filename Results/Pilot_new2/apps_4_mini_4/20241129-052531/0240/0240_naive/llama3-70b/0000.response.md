To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem states that we have a string `s` which is a shuffled combination of a number `n` and the integer `k`, where `k` is the number of digits in `n`. Additionally, we are given a substring `t` which is guaranteed to be a substring of `n`.

The goal is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from the string `s` and the substring `t`.

### Program Analysis

The program provided is as follows:

```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)  # Create a set from the substring t
    n = ''
    for c in s:     # Iterate over characters in s
        if c in t_set:  # If character is in the set of t
            n += c  # Append it to the result string n
    n += t  # Append the substring t to n
    return int(n)  # Convert to integer and return
print(func_1(s, t))
```

### Examination of Logic

1. **Constructing `n`:**
   - The program constructs `n` by iterating over the string `s` and including characters that are present in `t_set`. This does not guarantee that all digits of `n` are included or in the right order, nor does it ensure the smallest construction.
   
2. **Appending `t`:**
   - After constructing `n` from `s`, it appends `t`. This could potentially lead to a larger number instead of the smallest possible integer `n`.

### Potential Counterexample

To demonstrate that the program does not meet the problem requirements, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
s = "1234567890"
t = "01"
```

**Expected Output:**
The smallest `n` that can be created from `s` while containing `t` would be `10`, since we can rearrange `s` to `1023456789`, but the key point is that `n` should be the smallest integer; thus `10` is the correct answer.

**Program Output:**
In this case, the program would:
- Only include characters from `s` that are in `t_set`, which would lead to '01'.
- It would then append `t`, resulting in `01 + "01"` = `01`, which is not a valid integer representation.

### Conclusion

Based on the above analysis and the counterexample provided, the program does not correctly reconstruct the smallest integer `n` as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.
