#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string consisting of digits that may include leading zeroes.
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits, `n_len` is equal to `len(s) - len(sub)`, `s_counter` has values reflecting the original counts of digits in `s` after subtracting the counts from `sub`, `sub_counter` remains unchanged, and all characters in `sub_counter` have been processed.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the minimum integer from the list of possible numbers generated using the remaining characters in 's' after processing 'sub'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `sub`, both consisting of digits. It calculates the frequency of each digit in `s` and subtracts the frequency of each digit in `sub`. It then constructs a string of the remaining digits from `s` after removing the characters found in `sub`, generates all possible numbers from these remaining digits, and returns the smallest integer from that list. The function may encounter cases where no valid numbers can be generated if all digits from `s` are removed by `sub`, but the current implementation does not handle such cases explicitly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty substring of num_str which may contain leading zeroes.
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if 'sub' is a substring of 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `num_str` containing digits (up to 1,000,000 characters) and a non-empty substring `sub`. It returns True if `sub` is found within `num_str`, but it does not check the length of `num_str` against any variable `n_len` since `n_len` is not defined in the code, which means the function will always return True if `sub` is a substring of `num_str`, regardless of the length of `num_str`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a non-empty string containing digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string representing a substring of n, which can contain leading zeroes.
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring, and all valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the `is_valid_number` condition relative to `sub` have been yielded. If no valid permutations exist, no candidates are yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `chars` containing digits and a non-empty string `sub`. It generates all valid permutations of `chars` and yields those that satisfy the `is_valid_number` condition relative to `sub`. The function does not return a list of possible numbers; instead, it yields the valid permutations one by one, which means the results are generated lazily and can be iterated over. Additionally, it does not insert `sub` into `chars` at any position; instead, it checks the validity of the complete permutation against `sub`.
