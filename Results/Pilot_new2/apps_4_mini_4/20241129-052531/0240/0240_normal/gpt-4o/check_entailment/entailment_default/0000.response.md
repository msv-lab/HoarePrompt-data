To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, we need to analyze each function and how they contribute to the solution.

### Problem Description:
The task is to reconstruct the smallest integer `n` from a shuffled string `s` that contains `n` and the count of its digits, given a substring `sub` that is part of `n`.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(s, sub)`**:
   - It calculates `n_len` as the difference between the lengths of `s` and `sub`.
   - It uses `Counter` to find the frequency of digits in `s` and `sub`, and then creates a string of remaining digits.
   - It generates possible numbers by calling `generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)`.

2. **Function `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)`**:
   - It checks if `sub` is in `num_str`.
   - However, it does not check if `len(num_str) == n_len` because `n_len` is not defined within this function, which leads to improper validation.

3. **Function `generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub)`**:
   - It generates all valid permutations of the `chars` string and checks if they are valid against `sub` using `is_valid_number`.
   - This function yields valid candidates but does not consider the placement of `sub` within the permutations.

### Output Hints:
- **Function 1**: The output hint indicates it may not handle cases where all digits from `s` are removed by `sub`. This would cause `remaining_chars` to be empty, and thus, there would be no valid permutations.
  
- **Function 2**: The hint correctly notes that `is_valid_number` always returns True for `sub` being a substring, irrespective of the length condition, which is crucial for correctness.

- **Function 3**: It accepts `chars` and `sub` but does not ensure that `sub` is properly integrated into the permutations generated, leading to potential outputs that do not include `sub`.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- If `s` consists solely of digits that are all accounted for in `sub`, then `remaining_chars` would be empty, yielding no possible valid numbers.
- The lack of a proper validation condition in `is_valid_number` regarding the length of `num_str` means any string containing `sub` is considered valid, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where `sub` consumes all the digits in `s`, leading to an empty `remaining_chars`. Additionally, the validation in `is_valid_number` is flawed due to the undefined `n_len`, which means it inaccurately verifies `num_str`. 

Thus, it can be determined that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
