To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop. The loop is iterating over the permutations of the `chars` string, which is a non-empty string containing digits. 

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The `for` loop will execute as long as there are permutations of `chars` to iterate over. Since `chars` is defined as a non-empty string, it will always have at least one permutation, provided it's not an empty string.

2. **Variables in the Loop**: The variable `perm` will hold each permutation of `chars` during the iterations of the loop.

3. **Initial States**: 
   - `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits.
   - `sub` is also a non-empty string, but its role is not directly affecting the execution of the permutation loop.

4. **Conclusion**: For the loop to execute, `chars` being a non-empty string is sufficient. The internal state of `perm` will be defined at each iteration but is not relevant before the loop starts. There are no other dependencies or initializations required before the loop.

Thus, to summarize the necessary states before the loop starts:

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring (not directly affecting loop execution)**
