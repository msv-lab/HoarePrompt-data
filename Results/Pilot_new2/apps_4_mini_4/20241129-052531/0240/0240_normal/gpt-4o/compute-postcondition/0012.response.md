Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, then `candidate` is yielded.***
