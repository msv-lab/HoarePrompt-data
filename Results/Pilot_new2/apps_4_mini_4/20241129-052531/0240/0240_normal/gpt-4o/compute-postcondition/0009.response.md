According to the code, the for loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. Since `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, it generates a number of permutations based on the length of `chars`. The loop processes each permutation one by one.

At the end of the last iteration, the `perm` variable holds the last generated permutation of the digits in `chars`. The next permutation will be the next one in the sequence until all permutations are exhausted.

Since no information is provided about the exact state of `perm` after the last iteration, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `chars` remains unchanged and that there is at least one more permutation to process.

Thus, if `perm` is the last permutation, we would need the index to reflect the next permutation, and we can safely say that the character string `chars` remains the same. 

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring, `perm` must be the next permutation of `chars`**
