Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring, and `candidate` is equal to `''.join(perm)`. If `candidate` is a valid number in relation to `sub`, then `candidate` is yielded from the generator. Otherwise, no action is taken in the absence of an else part.***
