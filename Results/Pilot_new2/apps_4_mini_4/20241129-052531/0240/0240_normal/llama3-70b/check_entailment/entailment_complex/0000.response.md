Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Concatenation Logic**: The function first creates a string `n` by concatenating characters from the string `s` that are present in the substring `t`. However, this approach does not ensure that the resultant integer `n` is the smallest possible integer that can be formed from `s` while incorporating `t` at the end.

2. **Failure to Reconstruct Original Integer**: The problem requires reconstructing the original integer `n` while ensuring it has the correct number of digits (specifically, the digits of `n` plus the length of `n` as indicated by `k`). By only adding characters that are in `t`, the program could potentially miss other characters in `s` that could be crucial for forming the smallest integer `n`.

3. **Example Cases**: Consider the example input `003512` and the substring `021`. The current logic may lead to constructing `n` in a way that does not take all digits into account properly, potentially leading to results like `30021`, but the function might yield incorrect results or not follow the intended logic for a wide range of inputs.

4. **Leading Zeros**: The function does not handle cases with leading zeros correctly when forming `n`. According to the problem, the only valid number with leading zeros is `0` itself, and if the program constructs a number with leading zeros incorrectly, the output will be invalid.

In conclusion, the program fails to properly construct the smallest integer `n` as per the requirements of the problem description, making it incorrect.
