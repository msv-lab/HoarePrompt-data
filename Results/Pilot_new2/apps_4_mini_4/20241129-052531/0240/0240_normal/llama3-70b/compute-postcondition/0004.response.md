The statement `n += c` means that the current value of `c`, which is the first character of the string `s`, is being added to `n`. Given that `c` is a character (specifically a digit from the string `s`), it will be treated as its integer equivalent during the addition. The value of `n` is updated to reflect this addition.

The output state will retain all valid information from the initial state and reflect the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the first character of `s`, `c` is in `t_set`, `n` is updated to `n + int(c)`**.
