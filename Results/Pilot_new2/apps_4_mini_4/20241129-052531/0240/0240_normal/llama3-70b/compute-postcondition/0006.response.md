According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of digits, and `c` is the first character of `s`. After processing `c`, the next character in `s` will be used for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have at least one more character after `c`, which is the second character (if it exists).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits that must have at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `s`, `n` remains unchanged or updated according to the value of `c` if it is in `t_set`.**
