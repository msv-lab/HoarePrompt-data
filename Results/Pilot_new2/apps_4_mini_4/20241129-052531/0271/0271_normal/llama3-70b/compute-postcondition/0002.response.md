The code `print(n)` outputs the current value of `n` to the console. The value of `n` remains unchanged, thus all preconditions still hold. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the current value of `n` is such that `n` is divisible by 10 (i.e., `n % 10 == 0), and the value of `n` has been printed to the console.**
