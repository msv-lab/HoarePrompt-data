Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

The key issues are:
1. The program only checks if the current element is exactly double the previous element (`a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2`). This does not account for all possibilities of combining previous values to obtain the current value.
2. The operations specified in the problem description allow for the summation of any two previously stored values. The program fails to consider that it may be possible to create a value through different combinations, not just through doubling the previous value.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 5
```
In this case, we need to produce the sequence `1, 2, 3, 5`. 
- `b_1` can be `1` (initialized).
- `b_2` can then be `2` (`b_1 + b_1`).
- `b_1` can then be `3` (`b_1 + b_2`).
- Finally, `b_2` can be updated to `5` (`b_1 + b_2` which is `3 + 2`).

This example shows that the sequence can be achieved using only 2 variables (`b_1` and `b_2`), but the program would incorrectly evaluate `m` because it only checks for doubling rather than the possible combinations of previous values.

Thus, since there exists at least one input case where the program does not work correctly, the final evaluation is **False**.
