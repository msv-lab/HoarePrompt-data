Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of variables required to perform the operations as specified in the problem description. 

1. It attempts to sort the array `a`, which is unnecessary for the logic of determining if a number can be formed by the sum of previously assigned variables. The operations should be considered in the order given by the input, not sorted.

2. The program checks if `a[i]` can be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned values. However, it only checks if `a[i] - x` exists in the set `assigned`, which is insufficient. In the context of the problem, both `x` and `a[i] - x` must already be present in the `assigned` set to assign the value `a[i]` to some variable `b_y`.

3. The program does not account for the case where it might be impossible to perform the operations, as it never checks whether a value is assignable or if it's possible to assign values correctly based on the requirements.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
3 6 5
```

According to the problem, it is impossible to perform the operations since there are no two distinct previously assigned variables that can yield 5 or 6. The program fails to return `-1` as specified, instead it incorrectly processes the input.

Thus, since the program does not meet the requirements as specified in the problem description, the correctness is **False**.
