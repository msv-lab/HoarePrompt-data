To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided state and the for loop.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, which means that `i` will take values starting from `1` up to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `1`. Since we know that `n` is a positive integer within the range of `1 ≤ n ≤ 23`, the minimum value for `n` for the loop to execute is `2`. 

2. The state before the loop indicates that `n` is a positive integer, which could be `1`. However, if `n` is `1`, the `range(1, n)` results in an empty range, meaning the loop won't execute. 

3. Lastly, since the loop starts with `i` initialized to `1`, we can state that before the loop runs, `i` needs to be `1` when `n` is at least `2`.

Thus, we can summarize the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing the value `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
