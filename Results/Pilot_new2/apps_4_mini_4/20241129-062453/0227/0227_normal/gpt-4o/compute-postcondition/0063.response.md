In the given code snippet, `assigned.add(a[i])` adds the element `a[i]` from the list `a` to the set `assigned`. 

Here are the impacts step by step:
1. The variable `assigned` is modified by adding an element from the list `a`, specifically `a[i]`. We know that `assigned` previously included at least `a[1]` and `a[2]`, hence after execution, `assigned` will contain at least these two values plus `a[i]`.
2. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `can_form`, `m`) retain their values, but `assigned` will now also include the value `a[i]`.

Since `n` is greater than 3, `a` is still a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `can_form` remains False, the output state will reflect the updated contents of `assigned`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[i]`, `can_form` is False, and `m` remains unchanged.**
