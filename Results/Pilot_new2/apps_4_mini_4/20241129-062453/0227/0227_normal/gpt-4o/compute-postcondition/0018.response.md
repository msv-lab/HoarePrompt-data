Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 3 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the third value in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.***
