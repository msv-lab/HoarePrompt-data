The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and now includes `a[2]`, `i` is 3, `can_form` is True, `assigned` must not be empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
