The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 23` and each integer `a[k]` satisfies `1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9`. The specific order of the elements in `a` will be altered by the sorting operation, but the distinctness and the bounds of the integers will remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a[k]` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) still satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.**
