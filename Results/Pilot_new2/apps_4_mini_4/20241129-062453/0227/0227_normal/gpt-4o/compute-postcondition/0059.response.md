Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and `a[2]`, `can_form` is True if there exists an `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`, otherwise `can_form` remains False. If the loop does not execute, `assigned` is not empty, and `can_form` is still False.**
