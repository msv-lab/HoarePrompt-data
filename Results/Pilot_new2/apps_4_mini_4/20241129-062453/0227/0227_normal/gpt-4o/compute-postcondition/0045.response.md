The value of `can_form` is assigned `False`. This does not affect the other variables, and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and now includes `a[2]`, `i` is 3, and `can_form` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and now includes `a[2]`, `i` is 3, `can_form` is False**.
