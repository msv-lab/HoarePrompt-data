The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]`, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True, and the difference (a[i] - x) is an element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
