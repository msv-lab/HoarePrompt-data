The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing the value `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
