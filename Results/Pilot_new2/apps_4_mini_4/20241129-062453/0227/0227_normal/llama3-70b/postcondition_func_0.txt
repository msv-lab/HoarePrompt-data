The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9). It counts how many distinct integers in `a` are such that no element is double the preceding element in the sorted list. If the count `m` is greater than 23, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the count `m`.
