The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The value of `m` was initially 1, so after the execution of the code, `m` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `a` are not directly affected by this operation, so they remain the same. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers. The current value of `a[i]` is not equal to double the value of `a[i - 1]`.**
