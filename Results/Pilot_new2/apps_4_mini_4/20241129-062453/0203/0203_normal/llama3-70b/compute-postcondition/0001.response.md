`fractions` is assigned the value of the input, which represents some string entered by the user. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string.**
