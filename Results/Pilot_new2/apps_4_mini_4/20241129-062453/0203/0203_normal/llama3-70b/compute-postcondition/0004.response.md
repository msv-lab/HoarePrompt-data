To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variable `fractions`. The loop iterates over each character (or element) in the string `fractions`. For the loop to execute at least once, `fractions` must contain at least one character.

Here, we know that `n` is a positive integer and likely indicates the length of the string `fractions`, but we need to ensure that `fractions` is not empty.

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, we need the following states to be correctly set:
- `depublicans` and `remocrats` are both initialized to 0 before the loop starts, but their values may change during the loop execution.
- The variable `fraction` should be set to the first character (or element) of the `fractions` string at the start of the loop.

For the loop to execute:
1. `fractions` must not be empty (i.e., it should contain at least one character).
2. `fraction` should be set to the first character of `fractions`.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character in `fractions`**
