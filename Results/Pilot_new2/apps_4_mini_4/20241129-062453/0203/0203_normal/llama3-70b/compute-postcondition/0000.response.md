`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial condition that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) remains valid after this assignment. Other variables are not affected since no other code has been executed yet.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000)**
