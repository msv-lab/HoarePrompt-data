The variable `r_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The initial states of `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with length equal to `n`; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.
