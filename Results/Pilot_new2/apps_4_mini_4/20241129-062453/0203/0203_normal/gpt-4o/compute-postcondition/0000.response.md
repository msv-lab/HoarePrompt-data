`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must still satisfy the condition that it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The string representing the fractions of the n employees remains unchanged as no operation has been performed on it. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; the string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' remains unchanged.**
