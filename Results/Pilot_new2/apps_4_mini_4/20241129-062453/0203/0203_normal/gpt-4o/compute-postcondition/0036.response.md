Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue` and removed from it; `r_index` is now equal to the first element that was in `r_queue` before it was popped; `d_queue` now contains the previous elements plus the value `d_index + n`.**
