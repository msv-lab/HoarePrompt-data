The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the current value of `i`, which is `0`, to the list `d_queue`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is a list containing 0; `r_queue` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `v` is 'D'.**
