Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are empty. If `d_queue` is not empty, then it contains remaining 'D' votes, all elements in `votes` have been processed, and the output 'D' is printed. If `d_queue` is empty, both queues are empty, and all elements in `votes` have been processed, with `d_index` and `r_index` reflecting the last indices compared before the queues were emptied.***
