The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` but does not alter any of the variables in the program. The values of `T`, `n`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `balance`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `balance` is not equal to `x`, and the current value of `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` is equal to 0.**
