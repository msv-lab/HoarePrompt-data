The variables `n` and `x` are assigned the values obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n` and `x` will now hold integer values provided by the user. The other variables, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `balance`, `T`, and `_`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is equal to `T + 1`, `x` is an input integer.**
