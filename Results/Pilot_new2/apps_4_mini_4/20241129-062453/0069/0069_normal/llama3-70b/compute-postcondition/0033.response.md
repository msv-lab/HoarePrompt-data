Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is equal to `T + 1`, and `x` is an input integer. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
