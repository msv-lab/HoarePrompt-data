The variables `n` and `x` are assigned new values based on the input provided through the `input` function. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes two space-separated values from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `x` respectively. The previous ranges for `n` and `x` are no longer valid since they will now hold the values from the input, which can be any integers. The variable `T` remains unaffected as well as `s`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'**
