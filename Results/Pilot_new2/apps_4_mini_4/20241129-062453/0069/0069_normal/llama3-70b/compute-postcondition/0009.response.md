Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `balance` is not equal to `x`, and the current value of `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` is equal to 0.***
