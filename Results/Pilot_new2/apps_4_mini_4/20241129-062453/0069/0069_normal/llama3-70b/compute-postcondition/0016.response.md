The values of `n` and `x` are assigned the results of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input()` accepts two space-separated integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The value of `n` is directly updated, while `x` is introduced as a new variable. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is equal to `T`, `x` is an input integer.**
