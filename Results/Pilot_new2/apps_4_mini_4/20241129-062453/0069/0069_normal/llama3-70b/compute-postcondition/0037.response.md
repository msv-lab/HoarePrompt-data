Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s` (denoted as `balance`). Depending on the relationship between `balance` and `x`, it prints different results: if `balance` equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`; if `balance` does not equal `x` and the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The function assumes that `cnt0 - cnt1` is not zero; if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, it could lead to a division by zero error in certain conditions not handled in the code.**
