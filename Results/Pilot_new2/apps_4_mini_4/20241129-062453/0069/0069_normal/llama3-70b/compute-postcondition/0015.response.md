To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information and the for loop structure. The loop is set to iterate `T` times, and we need to establish what the state will be after executing the loop body once.

State at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `T` is between 1 and 100, implying that the loop has been executing with a set number of iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, we must increment `_` (the loop variable), which is typically used as a placeholder in Python for variables that are not actually used within the loop.

Since we are iterating up to `T`, the current value of `_` would be one less than `T`, given that `_` starts at 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `_` would be `T - 1`.

To prepare for the next iteration:
1. The current value of `_` must be incremented by 1, becoming `_ + 1`.
2. We need to ensure that `T` remains unchanged, as it defines the loop's range.
3. The values of `n`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain as they are, since we have not been told that they change between iterations.

With that in mind, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `T - 1 + 1 = T`. 

Thus, the state for the next iteration will be:

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `_` is equal to `T`.**
