Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is equal to `T`, and `x` is an input integer. If `balance` is equal to `x`, no additional action is taken. If `balance` is not equal to `x`, then if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, no additional action is taken; otherwise, the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` has been evaluated and printed.***
