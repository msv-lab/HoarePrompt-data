According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 results, the loop can execute again for the third result. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 2 results, `result` is the second element in `results`, and `index` is equal to `1 + 3 * T`. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list must have at least 3 results, `result` must be the third element in the list, and `index` should be updated accordingly. 

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `index` is equal to `1 + 3 * T`, `results` is a list containing at least 3 results, `result` is the third element in `results`**
