Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, `prefix_balances` is non-empty, `s` produces a non-empty `prefix_balances`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `count` is 1, and `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then the conditions hold true. Otherwise, these conditions do not apply.***
