The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to `s`. The variable `index` is currently 1, so `index + 2` evaluates to 3. The variable `s` will now hold the value of `data[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 1, `n` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings derived from the input, `results` is an empty list.**
