The code `results.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `-1` has been added to `results`, while the other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `index` is equal to `n + 7`, `n` is at least 1, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 5])`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, the current value of `balance` is 0, `x` is in `prefix_balances`, and `-1` has been appended to `results`.**
