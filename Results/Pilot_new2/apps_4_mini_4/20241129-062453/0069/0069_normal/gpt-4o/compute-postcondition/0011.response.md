The code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` and `prefix_balances`. The value of `n` is equal to `int(data[1])`, and `prefix_balances` is created based on this value. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `prefix_balances` has been initialized to a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `n` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1'), `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.**
