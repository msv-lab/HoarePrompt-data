Postcondition: ***Given that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, `s` produces a non-empty `prefix_balances`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances`, if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `count` remains unchanged.***
