Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, and `prefix_balances` is updated such that it contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from `s`, which is equal to `data[index + 2]`. If the current value of `balance` is 0, then if `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `-1` has been appended to `results`; otherwise, `0` has been appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, then `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list produced from `s`, and `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, where `b` is the last element in `prefix_balances`, and `count` is appended to `results.***
