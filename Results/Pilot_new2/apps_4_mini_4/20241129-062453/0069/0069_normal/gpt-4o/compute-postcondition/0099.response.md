Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, `prefix_balances` must be non-empty, `s` must produce a non-empty `prefix_balances`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `count` is 1, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, the current value of `x` minus `b` is divisible by `balance`, and the result of `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0.**
