Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `index` is equal to `n + 7`, `n` is at least 1, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 5])`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance up to index `i` based on the string `s` (with `prefix_balances[0]` being 0 and `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]` updated accordingly). The current value of `balance` is 0, and the value of `x` is in `prefix_balances`.***
