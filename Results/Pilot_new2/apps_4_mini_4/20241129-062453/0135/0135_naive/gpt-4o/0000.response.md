Correctness: **False**.

The code fails in cases where `k` is less than `n`. For example, if we take the input `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the function will return "Yes" because it will compute the remainders for `1, 2, 3, 4` as follows:

- `5 % 1 = 0`
- `5 % 2 = 1`
- `5 % 3 = 2`
- `5 % 4 = 1` 

Since `5 % 2` and `5 % 4` produce the same result (`1`), the remainders are not distinct, so the correct output should be "No". However, the code doesn't account for this situation properly, leading to incorrect results in such cases. Thus, the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
