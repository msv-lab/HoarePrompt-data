According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to and including `k`. Before the loop starts, `n` does not affect the execution of the loop, and `seen` being an empty set is also irrelevant to the execution of the loop itself. 

So for the loop to be executed, the value of `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and at the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen` is an empty set**
