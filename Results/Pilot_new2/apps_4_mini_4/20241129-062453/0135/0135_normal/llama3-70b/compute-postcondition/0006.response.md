The code execution is initiated with the command `exit()`, which causes the program to terminate immediately without modifying any of the variable values. The only statement that is executed is the termination of the program. Thus, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen` is an empty set, the current value of `remainder` is 0, and the value of `remainder` is in the set `seen`.**
