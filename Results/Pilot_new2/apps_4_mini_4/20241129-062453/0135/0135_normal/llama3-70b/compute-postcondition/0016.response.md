The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`, where `i` is 3. Thus, `remainder` will hold the value of `n` modulo 3. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing 0 and possibly 1, and `remainder` is equal to `n % 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing 0 and possibly 1, `remainder` is equal to `n % 3.**
