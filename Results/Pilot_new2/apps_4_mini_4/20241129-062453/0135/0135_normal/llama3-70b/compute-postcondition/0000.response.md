The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which consists of two integers separated by a space. Since `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`, the exact values of `n` and `k` will depend on the input provided. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.**
