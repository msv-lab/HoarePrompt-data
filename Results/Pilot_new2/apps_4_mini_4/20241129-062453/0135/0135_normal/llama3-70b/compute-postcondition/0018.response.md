The command `exit()` terminates the execution of the program immediately. As a result, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program will not proceed any further. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values and the fact that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing 0 and possibly 1, `remainder` is equal to `n % 3, and 'No' has been printed; the program has exited.**
