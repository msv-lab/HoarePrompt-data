Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. Specifically, when `k` is greater than `n`, the remainders for `n % i` where `i` ranges from `1` to `n` will always include the values `0` to `n-1` and will not have a repeated value. However, for `i` values greater than `n`, `n % i` will always return `n` (if `k > n`), which means that if `i = n + 1`, `n + 1`, and so forth, the remainders could repeat. 

For example:
- If `n = 5` and `k = 10`, the program will check remainders from `1` to `10`. The remainders will be:
  - `n % 1` = `0`
  - `n % 2` = `1`
  - `n % 3` = `2`
  - `n % 4` = `1`
  - `n % 5` = `0`
  - `n % 6` = `5`
  - and so on for greater values of `i`.

As seen in this example, `n % 2` and `n % 4` give the same result (1), which violates the requirement for distinct remainders when `k` exceeds `n`.

Thus, the program does not account for the case where `k` can be larger than `n` and fails to ensure that all remainders are distinct in this scenario. Therefore, the condition that the program meets the problem description for all potential cases is not satisfied.
