Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. The program checks the distinctness of remainders \( n \mod i \) for all integers \( i \) from 1 to \( k \). However, there is a crucial flaw in the logic used to determine distinctness, specifically regarding the value of \( n \mod 1 \).

2. **Remainders with 1:** 
   - For any integer \( n \), the remainder when divided by 1 is always 0. Therefore, \( n \mod 1 = 0 \). This means that if \( k \) is at least 1, the program will always encounter the remainder 0 when \( i = 1 \).
   - If \( k \) is greater than or equal to 1, this will lead to the first remainder being added to the `seen` set, but subsequent calculations will eventually check for other values of \( i \) where \( n \mod i \) may return values that have already been encountered, thus violating the distinctness requirement.

3. **Specific Cases:**
   - For any \( n \) and \( k \geq 1\), the program will always print “No” since \( n \mod 1 \) will always be 0, causing an early exit from the function when it checks \( n \mod 1 \).

4. **Lack of Handling for Large Inputs:**
   - The program uses a set to keep track of seen remainders, which is fine, but it doesn't handle the fact that once \( i \) exceeds \( n \), the remainders can start repeating or become non-unique. The logic does not account for the distinctness properly when \( k \) is larger than \( n \).

Thus, the program does not correctly determine whether all the remainders from \( n \mod 1 \) to \( n \mod k \) are distinct in all scenarios, particularly when \( k \) is equal to or larger than 1. Therefore, the correctness statement is false.
