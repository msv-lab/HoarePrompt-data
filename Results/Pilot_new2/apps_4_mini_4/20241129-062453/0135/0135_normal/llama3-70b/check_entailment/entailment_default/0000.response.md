To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's first analyze the problem description and then review the code along with the output hints.

### Problem Description:
We need to check if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. This means we need to ensure that for any two integers `i` and `j` (where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`), the condition `n mod i ≠ n mod j` holds.

### Provided Program:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
seen = set()
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    remainder = n % i
    if remainder in seen:
        print('No')
        exit()
    seen.add(remainder)
print('Yes')
```

### Output Hints:
The function checks if all remainders of `n` when divided by integers from `1` to `k` are unique. If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code initializes a set named `seen` to track the unique remainders.
2. It iterates over the range from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
3. If a remainder is already in the `seen` set, it outputs 'No' and exits.
4. If all remainders are unique, it outputs 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `k` is `1`, the only remainder calculated will be `n % 1`, which is always `0`, hence it should output 'No' since `0` is not distinct.
2. For any cases where `n` is less than `k`, the remainders might not be distinct for some values of `k`. For instance, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, remainders would be `0 (2%1)`, `2 (2%2)`, and `0 (2%3)`, which are not distinct.

### Review of Output Hints:
The output hints are consistent with the code. They accurately describe the function's intent to check for unique remainders, and they indicate that if any remainder repeats, the output will be 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the edge cases correctly, specifically when `k` is `1` and also when `k` is greater than `n`. In these scenarios, it can produce incorrect outputs because it does not account for the possibility that the same remainder may appear multiple times for values of `k` that exceed `n`.

Correctness: **False**. 

The specific case where this fails is when `n = 2` and `k = 3`, leading to non-distinct remainders.
