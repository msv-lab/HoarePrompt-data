According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. Since `k` is less than `n`, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` will equal `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1, and `i` will start from 1 and will increment until it reaches `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k < n, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
