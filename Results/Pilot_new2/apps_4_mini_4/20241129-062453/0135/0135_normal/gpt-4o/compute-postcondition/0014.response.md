`seen_remainders` is updated to include the current `remainder`, which is 0. Since `remainder` was not in `seen_remainders` before this operation, no output was returned from the conditional check. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k ≥ 2, `seen_remainders` now includes 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is 0.**
