To analyze the provided code snippet step by step:

1. The initial state includes variables where `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^18, `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^18 and at least 3, `seen_remainders` contains 0, and `i` is 3.
2. The code calculates `remainder` as `n % 3`.
3. The condition checks if `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`. If it is, the program would return 'No'.
4. In the else part, the only operation is to add `remainder` to `seen_remainders` using `seen_remainders.add(remainder)`.

Since we are not given the specific value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `remainder`. However, we do know that `remainder` can be 0, 1, or 2 based on the modulo operation with 3.

- If `remainder` is 0, since 0 is already in `seen_remainders`, 'No' would be returned.
- If `remainder` is 1 or 2, these values would not be in `seen_remainders`, so they would be added.

In either case, `seen_remainders` would be updated if `remainder` is 1 or 2. Therefore, we only need to update the contents of `seen_remainders` based on the possible values of `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k ≥ 3; `seen_remainders` includes 0 and possibly 1 or 2 depending on the value of `remainder`; `i` is 3.**
