To determine the output state after the given code is executed, let's analyze the provided initial conditions and the effect of the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned new integer values based on input.
- `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`.
- `b` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`.
- `a ≠ b`.
- `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
- `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
- `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

### Code Execution:
```
min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
```

#### Impact of the Code:
1. The code calculates the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`.
2. It also computes the complementary block distance `n - abs(a_block - b_block)`.
3. The `min()` function determines the smaller of these two values.
4. Finally, this minimum difference is multiplied by 15, and the result is assigned to the variable `min_block_time`.

### Conclusion:
The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `b_floor` remain unchanged after execution. The only new variable that is defined is `min_block_time`, which is calculated based on the previously defined variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned new integer values based on input; `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `a` ≠ `b`; `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_block_time` is `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.**
