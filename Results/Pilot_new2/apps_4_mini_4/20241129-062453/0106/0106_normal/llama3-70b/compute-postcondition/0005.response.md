The variable `b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values from input; `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`, and `b` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k` where `a` ≠ `b`. The value of `b_block` is calculated based on `b`, as it is the only variable affected by the executed code. 

Since `b` is in the range from 1 to `n·m·k`, `b_block` will be a positive integer based on the formula provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned new integer values based on input; `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `a` ≠ `b`; `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
