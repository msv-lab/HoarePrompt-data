The value of `b_floor` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, while `b_floor` is calculated based on the value of `b`. The value of `b` is between 1 and `n·m·k`, ensuring that the calculation is valid. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned new integer values based on input; `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `a` ≠ `b`; `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`.**
