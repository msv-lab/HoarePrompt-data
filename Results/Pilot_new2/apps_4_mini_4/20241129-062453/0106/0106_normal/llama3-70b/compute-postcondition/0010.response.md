The variable `min_floor_time` is assigned the value `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given that `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, the expression `(b_floor - a_floor)` is non-negative. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned new integer values based on input; `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `a` ≠ `b`; `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_block_time` is `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`; `min_floor_time` is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.**
