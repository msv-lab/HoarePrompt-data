The value of `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The variable `floor_within_block` is defined as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, so the value of `floor` can be expressed in terms of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`; `floor` is equal to `(floor_within_block // k) + 1**.
