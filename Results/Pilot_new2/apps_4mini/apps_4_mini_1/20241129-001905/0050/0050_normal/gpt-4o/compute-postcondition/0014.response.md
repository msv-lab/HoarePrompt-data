Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and two lists `s` and `b`. It calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buy price, computes the remaining money after the purchase, and then calculates the total amount of money that would be received from selling those shares at the maximum sell price, plus any remaining money from the initial amount. Finally, it prints this total amount. The function does not return any values, it only prints the results. **
