The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created from the input integers converted to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The state of `b` will be updated based on user input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 30; `r` is an input integer; `s` is a list of n integers derived from input; `b` is a list of m integers derived from input, where each element b[j] satisfies 1 <= b[j] <= 1000.**
