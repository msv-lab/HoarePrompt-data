Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30; `r` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `n` integers derived from input; `b` is a list of `m` integers derived from input where each element `b[j]` satisfies 1 <= `b[j]` <= 1000; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the value of `r` has been printed. Otherwise, `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`; and `total_bourles` is equal to `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, which has been printed.***
