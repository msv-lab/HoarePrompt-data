Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on input, where each integer `s_i` is such that 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `r` is greater than or equal to the current value of `s[i]`.***
