Postcondition: ***`shares` is the total number of shares acquired. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[i]`, and the list `s` remains a sorted list of integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, with `m` greater than or equal to 2 and `i` equal to 2. If `shares` is not greater than 0, `r` remains the remaining amount after possible deductions, and the list `s` still remains a sorted list of integers such that 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000, with `m` greater than or equal to 2 and `i` equal to 2.***
