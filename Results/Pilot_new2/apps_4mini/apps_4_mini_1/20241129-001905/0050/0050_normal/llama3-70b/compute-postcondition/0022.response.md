Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, and `i` is 2. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[2]`, then `r` is updated to `r % s[2]` and `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[2])`. If `r` is less than `s[2]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
