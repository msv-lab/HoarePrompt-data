According to the code, the loop iterates with the variable `i` starting from `k - 1` down to `0`. The current state indicates that `i` is `k - 1` at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by `1`. 

Since the loop will continue until `i` is no longer greater than or equal to `0`, the next value for `i` will be `k - 2`. Additionally, the variables `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` do not change during the loop iteration, so they remain the same.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the values need to be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min_sum - 1 \); `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd] \) and the last element has been incremented by 1; `i` is \( k - 2 \**
