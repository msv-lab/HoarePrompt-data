To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we focus on the loop's behavior and how the states of the variables change throughout its execution.

1. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. If `remainder` is initially `0`, the loop will not execute at all.
2. The loop increments elements of the `sequence` list and decrements `remainder` until either `remainder` becomes `0` or the loop has completed all its iterations.
3. The number of times the loop can execute directly depends on the initial value of `remainder`.
4. The final state of the `sequence` will reflect how many times we could increment its elements based on the number of times the loop executed.

If the loop executes fully, it would iterate `k` times at most (from `k - 1` to `0`). The final state of the `remainder` will be decremented by the number of times the loop executed, meaning if it executes `r` times, the final remainder would be `initial_remainder - r`.

Here's the analysis of the final output state:

- If `remainder` was `0` at the start, the loop doesnâ€™t execute, and `sequence` remains as `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]` with `remainder` still being `0`.
- If the loop executes completely (up to `k` times), then `remainder` will be `0` and `sequence` will be incremented such that the last element would be `kd + k`.

Summarizing these points, we have the following output state:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `remainder` is `0`; `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd + r] \), where \( r \) is the number of times the loop executed (from `0` to `k`).**
