To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze if it correctly generates a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Breakdown of the Program Logic

1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: 
   - The program first calculates the minimum sum required for `k` strictly increasing positive integers using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. This sum corresponds to the smallest possible sequence: `[1, 2, ..., k]`. 
   - If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns `-1` as it's impossible to form such a sequence with the given `n`.

2. **Base Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which is the greatest integer that, when used to scale the minimum sequence, does not exceed `n`.
   - The remainder `remainder = n - d * min_sum` is computed to see how much more can be distributed to the sequence while keeping it valid.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is initialized as `[d, 2d, ..., kd]`.
   - The program then attempts to distribute the `remainder` across the last elements of the sequence, incrementing elements if the remainder allows.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description

- **Strictly Increasing Requirement**: The sequence is constructed as `[d, 2d, ..., kd]`, which is inherently strictly increasing as long as `d > 0`.
- **Sum Equals `n`**: The sum of the calculated sequence plus the distributed `remainder` must equal `n`. This is ensured by the way `d` and `remainder` are calculated.
- **Maximal GCD**: The GCD of the final sequence should be maximized, which is `d` in this case. If `d` is used to scale the sequence, it ensures all elements are divisible by `d`, hence maximizing the GCD.

### Edge Cases

- The program returns `-1` if `min_sum > n`, which aligns with the problem description indicating that if no sequence can be formed, `-1` should be output.
- The distribution of the `remainder` is done in a way that maintains strict increasing order, ensuring that no two elements are equal while still adhering to the total sum condition.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles cases where a sequence cannot be formed and always produces a valid sequence of strictly increasing integers when possible, while maximizing the GCD.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **True**
