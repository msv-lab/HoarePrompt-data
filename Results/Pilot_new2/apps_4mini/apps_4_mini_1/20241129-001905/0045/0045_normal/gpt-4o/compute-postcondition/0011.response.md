The variable `sequence` is a list with elements defined as `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`, and the index `i` is equal to `k - 1`, which means it refers to the last element of the `sequence` list. The operation `sequence[i] += 1` increments the last element of the `sequence` list by 1.

Since `remaineder` is currently not equal to 0, the program is still running and the break statement does not apply. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min\_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min_sum \); `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, (k-1)d, kd + 1] \); `i` is \( k - 1 \).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min\_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min_sum \); `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd] \) and the last element has been incremented by 1; `i` is \( k - 1 \**.
