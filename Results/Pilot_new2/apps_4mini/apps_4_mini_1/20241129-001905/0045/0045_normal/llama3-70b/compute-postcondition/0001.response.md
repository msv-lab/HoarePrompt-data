The variable `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and the variable `b` is assigned the value `a % b`. The values of `a` and `b` are both positive integers. After the operation, `a` will take the value of `b`, and `b` will become the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is equal to the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b`.**
