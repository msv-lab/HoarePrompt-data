The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, with `a` taking the previous value of `b`, and `b` being assigned the result of `a % b`. Given the initial state where `a` is equal to the previous value of `b` (i.e., `a = b_prev`), and since `b` is greater than `0` and `b_prev` is greater than `b`, the modulus operation will yield a value for `b` that is less than `b` but still greater than or equal to `0`.

Thus, after executing the code snippet, we have:
- `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, which is `b_prev`.
- `b` becomes `a % b`, where `a` was initially `b_prev`, leading to `b = b_prev % b`.

The Output State is: **`a` is equal to `b_prev`, `b` is equal to `b_prev % b`, where `b` is greater than `0` and `b_prev` is greater than `b`.**
