Postcondition: ***`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If `a` is less than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be less than `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be greater than `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are equal. Additionally, `a` is '0' if and only if `b` is '0', and the lengths of `a` and `b` remain equal throughout.***
