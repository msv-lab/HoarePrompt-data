Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements as described in the problem statement for comparing two very long integers represented as strings, including handling leading zeros. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a whole line of input using `input().split()`, which captures both integers `a` and `b` as strings in a list called `data`. This is efficient for large input sizes, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Leading Zero Removal**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both integers, ensuring that comparisons are made on the actual numeric values rather than their string representations with leading zeros.

3. **Zero Handling**: If either `a` or `b` becomes an empty string after removing leading zeros (which would indicate that the original number was zero), it sets that value to `'0'`. This handles cases where the input might be '0000' for example, correctly interpreting it as zero.

4. **Length Comparison**: The program first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. If `a` is shorter than `b`, it prints '<'; if `a` is longer, it prints '>'. This is a correct initial step because, for non-negative integers, the number with more digits is always greater.

5. **Lexicographical Comparison for Equal Lengths**: If the lengths are equal, the program compares `a` and `b` lexicographically (using standard string comparison) to determine which is larger or if they are equal. This is valid because both strings represent non-negative integers, and the lexicographical order for strings of equal length correctly reflects their numeric order.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparisons, which directly matches the required output format.

Overall, the program comprehensively meets the requirements of the problem description, handling all specified cases effectively. Therefore, it is correct.
