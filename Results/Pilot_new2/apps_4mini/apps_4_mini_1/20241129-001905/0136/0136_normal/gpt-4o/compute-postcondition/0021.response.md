The code simply prints '=' to the output. The variables in the initial state remain unchanged as there are no assignments or calculations affecting them, and no variables are returned. 

Output State: **`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. The value of `a` is equal to `b`.**
