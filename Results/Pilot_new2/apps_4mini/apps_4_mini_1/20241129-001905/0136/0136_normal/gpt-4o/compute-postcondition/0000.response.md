The variable `data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly assigned yet, but they are meant to represent the two non-negative integers that will be input. Therefore, after this line of code executes, `data` will contain two elements corresponding to these input integers.

Output State: **The function reads two non-negative integers a and b from input, represented as strings in `data`, which is a list of length 2.**
