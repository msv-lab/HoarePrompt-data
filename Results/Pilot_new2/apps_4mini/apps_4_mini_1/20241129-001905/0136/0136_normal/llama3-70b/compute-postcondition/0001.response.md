The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input()` with leading zeros removed using `lstrip('0')`. The previous state of `b` was a non-negative integer represented as a string which may include leading zeroes. After applying `lstrip('0')`, `b` will hold the same digits but without any leading zeros. If the original value of `b` was only zeros, `b` will become an empty string.

The value of `a` remains unchanged and is still the input string with leading zeros removed.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeros removed; `b` is the input string without leading zeros.**
