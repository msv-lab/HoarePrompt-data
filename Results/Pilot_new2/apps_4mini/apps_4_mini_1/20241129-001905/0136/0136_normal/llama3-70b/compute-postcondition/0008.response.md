The code `print('>')` outputs the string `'>'` but does not modify any variables or their values. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged and retain their prior conditions.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeros removed; `b` is the input string without leading zeros. The strings `a` and `b` are not equal, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
