Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two non-negative integer values as strings, which is appropriate given the potential length of the input (up to \(10^6\) digits). It successfully uses `input()` to read the entire line at once, which aligns with the instruction to avoid reading symbols one by one.

2. **Leading Zeroes Removal**: The program uses the `lstrip('0')` method to remove leading zeroes from both input strings. This is necessary because the comparison should be made on the actual numerical values without leading zeroes influencing the result.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
    - It first checks if the cleaned strings `a` and `b` are equal and prints `'='` if they are. This correctly addresses the case of equality.
    - If they are not equal, it then compares the two strings using the `<` and `>` operators. Since the strings are being compared after leading zeroes have been removed, this correctly reflects their numeric values.

4. **Output**: The program prints the expected symbols `<`, `>`, or `=` based on the comparison results, exactly as described in the problem statement.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program effectively handles cases such as both inputs being equal with leading zeroes, or one input being larger than the other despite the presence of leading zeros.

Overall, the program adheres to all specifications provided in the problem description and correctly handles all described scenarios, ensuring proper functionality across the specified range of inputs.
