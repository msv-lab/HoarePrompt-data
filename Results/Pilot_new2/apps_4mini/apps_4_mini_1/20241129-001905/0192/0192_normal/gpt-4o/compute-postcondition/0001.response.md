The code prints the result of the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. The variables `x` and `y` are integers based on user input, where 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100000. 

Calculating the output of the expression:
- Let `d = x - y`. 
- Then the expression becomes `d // 2 + d % 2`.
- `d // 2` gives the integer division of `d` by 2.
- `d % 2` gives the remainder when `d` is divided by 2, which is either 0 or 1.

The full output state includes the information about `x`, `y`, and the calculated result based on these inputs. The result is not stored in a variable but rather printed out.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers based on user input; 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100000; result is `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`**.
