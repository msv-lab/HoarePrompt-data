Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function simply computes and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not account for the required operations to convert the equilateral triangle from side length `x` to side length `y` while adhering to the constraints of maintaining a valid triangle throughout the process.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the test case where `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle from side length 6 to 3 is 4 seconds, as described in the problem. However, the function would incorrectly output `abs(6 - 3)`, which is 3, failing to consider the steps involved in maintaining a valid triangle during the transformation.

An accurate solution would need to implement a strategy that ensures the triangle remains non-degenerate at each step while decrementing the side lengths as needed, rather than simply calculating the difference. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
