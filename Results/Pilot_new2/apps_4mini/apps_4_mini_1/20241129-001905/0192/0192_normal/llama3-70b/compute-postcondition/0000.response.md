The variables `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on user input. The previous values of `x` and `y` fall within the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. After execution, `x` and `y` will hold the new integers provided by the user through input. The values of `x` and `y` are not predetermined but are constrained by the relationships defined in the initial state.

Output State: **3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000; `x` and `y` are input integers**
