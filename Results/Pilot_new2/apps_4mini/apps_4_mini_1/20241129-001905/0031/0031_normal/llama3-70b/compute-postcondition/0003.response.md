According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute for `k` iterations, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = k - 1`. Given the constraints for `k`, it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `k`, which means it will increment up to `k - 1`. Thus, before the loop starts, we need to set `i` to 0.

For the loop to be executed, the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. `k` must be at least 2.
2. `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
