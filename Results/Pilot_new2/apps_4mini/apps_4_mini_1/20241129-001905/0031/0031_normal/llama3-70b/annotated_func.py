#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n, k):
    total_days = 2 ** n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator *= total_days - i
        
        denominator *= total_days
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\); `numerator` is equal to \(2^n \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1))\); `denominator` is equal to \(2^{nk}\).
    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    return numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)
    #The program returns the values of numerator and denominator modulo \(10^6 + 3\), where numerator is calculated based on \(2^n\) and k, and denominator is based on \(nk\) and the minimum of \(n\) and \(nk\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It computes `total_days` as \(2^n\), then calculates the `numerator` as the product of decreasing values starting from `total_days` for `k` iterations and the `denominator` as \(2^{nk}\). Finally, it returns the values of `numerator` and `denominator` reduced modulo \(10^6 + 3\). The function does not handle potential edge cases related to very large integers since Python's integers can handle arbitrary precision, but the potential for performance issues with large `k` is implied without explicit checks.
