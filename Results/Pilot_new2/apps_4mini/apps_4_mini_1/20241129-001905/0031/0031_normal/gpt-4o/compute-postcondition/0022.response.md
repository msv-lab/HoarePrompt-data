B is assigned the value of `p_total`. The value of `A` remains unchanged as it is equal to `p_shared`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is equal to `p_shared`, `B` is equal to `p_total`.

Output State: **`A` is equal to `p_shared`, `B` is equal to `p_total**
