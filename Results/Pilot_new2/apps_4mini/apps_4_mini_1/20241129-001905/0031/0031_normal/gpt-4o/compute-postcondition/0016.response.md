The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is 4, `total_days` is 2, and `MOD` is 1000003. 

Calculating the new value of `denominator`:
```
denominator = 4 * 2 % 1000003
denominator = 8 % 1000003
denominator = 8
```

The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and must be greater than 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 8, `i` is 2**.
