The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it by `total_days` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is 2. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

denominator = (1 * 2) % 1000003 = 2.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 2, `i` is 0**.
