The variable `denominator` is assigned the value `1`, which overrides any previous value it may have had. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.**
