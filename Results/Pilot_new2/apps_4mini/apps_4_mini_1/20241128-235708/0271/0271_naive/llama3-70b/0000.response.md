To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

The problem requires rounding a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with a `0`. The rounding rules are:
1. If `n` already ends with `0`, it should remain unchanged.
2. If `n` does not end with `0`, it should be rounded down to the nearest multiple of `10` if the last digit is `0-5`, and rounded up to the next multiple of `10` if the last digit is `6-9`.

Let's analyze the program:

```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

1. **When `n % 10 == 0`**: This correctly handles numbers like `0`, `10`, `20`, etc., and returns `n`.

2. **When `n % 10 <= 5`**: This part handles numbers that end with digits from `0` to `5`. For example:
   - If `n = 5`, it calculates `n - n % 10`, which results in `0`. This is one of the correct answers since `0` and `10` are both acceptable rounded values for `5`.
   - If `n = 113`, it calculates `113 - 113 % 10`, which results in `110`.

3. **When `n % 10 > 5`**: This part handles numbers that end with digits from `6` to `9`. For example:
   - If `n = 5432359`, it calculates `5432359 + (10 - 9)`, which results in `5432360`.

However, let's check a specific edge case:
- If `n = 0`, the output is `0`, which is correct.
- If `n = 5`, it computes and returns `0`, which is valid.
- If `n = 6`, it computes `n + (10 - n % 10)` resulting in `10`, which is correct.
- If `n = 9`, it computes `n + (10 - n % 10)` resulting in `10`, which is also correct.

But now consider `n = 15`:
- According to the logic:
  - `n % 10` equals `5`, so it falls into the second case and returns `10` (since `15 - 5 = 10`).

This is correct as `10` is a valid round. 

All edge cases seem to be handled correctly in the provided code, including:
- Numbers that are already multiples of 10.
- Numbers ending in 1-5 are rounded down correctly.
- Numbers ending in 6-9 are rounded up correctly.

No edge case has been found that the program does not handle correctly.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly rounds the number `n` to the nearest integer that ends with `0`, handling all specified cases in the problem description correctly.
