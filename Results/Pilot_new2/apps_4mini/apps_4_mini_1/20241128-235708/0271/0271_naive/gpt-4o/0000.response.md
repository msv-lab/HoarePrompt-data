To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we analyze the rounding logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer ending with 0. If `n` already ends with 0, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, there are two possible outcomes when rounding: rounding down to the nearest lower multiple of 10 or rounding up to the nearest higher multiple of 10. Both outcomes are valid, as specified in the problem description.

### Program Logic:
The program reads an integer `n`, calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, and then:
- If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`.
- If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference needed to reach the next multiple of 10.

### Edge Cases:
1. For `n = 5`, the remainder is `5`. The program will round down to `0`, which is one valid answer. It could also round up to `10`, which is also valid, but the program's choice of `0` is acceptable.
2. For `n = 10`, the remainder is `0`, so it remains `10`.
3. For `n = 15`, the remainder is `5`, and the program rounds down to `10`, which is valid.
4. For `n = 25`, the remainder is `5` again, and it rounds down to `20`, which is valid.
5. For `n = 21`, the remainder is `1`, rounding down to `20`, which is valid.
6. For numbers like `n = 11`, the program correctly rounds down to `10`.

### Potential Issue:
The only potential area of concern is with the rounding logic for values very close to the midpoint (5, 15, 25, etc.) where the behavior is consistent with the problem statement. However, since rounding down in this case is still a valid operation, the program adheres to the requirement.

### Final Evaluation:
Upon reviewing all the cases and the logic behind the rounding mechanism in the program, there doesn't appear to be any input for which the program fails to produce a correct output as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly implements the rounding logic for all specified inputs.
