Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the input integer `n` is already a multiple of 10 (`n % 10 == 0`). If it is, the program prints `n`, which matches the requirement that if `n` ends with 0, it is considered already rounded.

2. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the program then evaluates the last digit of `n` using `n % 10`. It has two branches:
   - If the last digit is less than or equal to 5 (`n % 10 <= 5`), the program calculates and prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than `n` by using `n - n % 10`. This is correct as it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10.
   - If the last digit is greater than 5, the program computes the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than `n` using `n + (10 - n % 10)`. This rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10, which is also correct.

The program adheres to the problem description's requirements by handling edge cases (like when `n` ends with 0, between 1-5, or between 6-9) correctly and determining valid outputs for all specified conditions.

Thus, the implementation is robust and accurately reflects the rounding behavior as required, confirming that the program is indeed correct.
