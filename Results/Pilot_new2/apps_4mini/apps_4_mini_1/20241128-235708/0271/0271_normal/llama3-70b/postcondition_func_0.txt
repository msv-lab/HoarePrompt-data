The function does not accept any parameters and prompts the user for a non-negative integer `n`. It prints `n` if it is a multiple of 10. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than `n` if the last digit of `n` is 5 or less, or the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than `n` if the last digit is greater than 5.
