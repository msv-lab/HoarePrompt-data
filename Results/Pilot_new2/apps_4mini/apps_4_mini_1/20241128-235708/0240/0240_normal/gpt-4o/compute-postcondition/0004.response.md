Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number in relation to `sub`, then the function confirms this validity. There is no else part in the code.***
