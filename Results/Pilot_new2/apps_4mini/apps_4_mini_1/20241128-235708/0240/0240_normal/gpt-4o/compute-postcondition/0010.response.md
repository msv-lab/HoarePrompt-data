The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the joined string from the list `perm`. Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` now holds that permutation represented as a string. The values of `chars`, `sub`, and `perm` remain unchanged after the execution of the code. 

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to the string representation of `perm`.**
