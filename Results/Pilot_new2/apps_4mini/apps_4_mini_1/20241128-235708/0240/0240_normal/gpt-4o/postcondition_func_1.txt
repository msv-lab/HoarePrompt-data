The function accepts two parameters, `num_str` and `sub`, both of which are non-empty strings consisting of digits. It returns True if `sub` is found within `num_str` and `num_str` has a length equal to `n_len`, which is not defined in the code but is implied to be a variable representing a specific length. If either condition is not met, it returns False. However, since `n_len` is not defined or set within the function, the functionality as described cannot be accurately fulfilled. Thus, the function will always check the presence of `sub` in `num_str` without a proper length comparison, leading to potentially unexpected behavior.
