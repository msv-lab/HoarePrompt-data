According to the code, the loop is designed to execute permutations of the string `chars`. Since `chars` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute as long as there are characters to permute. 

In each iteration of the loop, we will get a new permutation stored in `perm`. The length of the `chars` string is relevant because it determines how many permutations will be generated. However, since `chars` is non-empty, we can conclude that the loop will execute at least once.

The variables `perm` will represent different permutations of `chars`, and it should initially be set appropriately once the loop begins executing, as it will be assigned a value from the permutations generated by `chars`.

Thus, the final state before the loop starts should reflect that `perm` will represent the first permutation of `chars` when the loop begins.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
