#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer with a maximum length of 1,000,000 characters, and t is a non-empty substring of s that may contain leading zeroes.
def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string containing the characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`, preserving the order of their appearance in `s`. `s` is a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`. If `s` does not contain any characters from `t_set`, then `n` will remain an empty string.
    n += t
    return int(n)
    #The program returns the integer value of string `n`, which contains the characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`, preserving the order of their appearance in `s`, plus the characters from `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `s`, a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer, and `t`, a non-empty substring of `s`. It constructs a new string `n` by including characters from `s` that also appear in `t`, while preserving their original order from `s`. It then concatenates `t` to the end of `n` and returns the integer value of this final string. If `s` does not contain any characters from `t`, the returned integer will be equal to the integer value of `t` itself.
