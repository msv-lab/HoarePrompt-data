The variable `t_set` is assigned the value of a set created from the characters in the string `t`. This means that `t_set` will contain unique characters that appear in `t`, regardless of their order or frequency. The values of `s` and `t` remain unchanged, and `t_set` now holds a collection of the distinct characters from `t`. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer with a maximum length of 1,000,000 characters; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that may contain leading zeroes; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`.**
