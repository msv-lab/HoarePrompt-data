Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `s`, a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer, and `t`, a non-empty substring of `s`. It constructs a new string `n` by including characters from `s` that also appear in `t`, while preserving their original order from `s`. It then concatenates `t` to the end of `n` and returns the integer value of this final string. If `s` does not contain any characters from `t`, the returned integer will be equal to the integer value of `t` itself. **
