Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. 

Here are the issues:

1. The condition `if (x < y)` correctly prints `'-'` when the number of upvotes is strictly less than the number of downvotes. However, it does not take into account the potential votes from the `z` individuals. The program should check if the total possible downvotes (i.e., `y + z`) are strictly greater than `x` to ensure that it can definitely conclude that the result will be `'-'`. 

2. There is a logical oversight in the condition `if (x > y + z)`. While it can correctly determine that there will definitely be more upvotes than downvotes, it does not consider the case where upvotes could be exactly equal to downvotes when incorporating the unknown votes. 

3. The check for equality, `if (x == y)`, only checks if `z` is 0 to print `'0'` or otherwise returns `'?'.` However, if `z` is greater than 0, and `x` is equal to `y`, it means that depending on the `z` votes, the result could be either `'-'` or `'+'`, which makes the result uncertain.

In summary, the program fails to account for the potential influence of the unknown votes (`z`) in several cases, leading to incorrect outputs for certain combinations of `x`, `y`, and `z`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description.
