Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, the output is '+'; otherwise, if `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'; if `x` is equal to `y`, the output is '0' if `z` equals 0; otherwise, `x` remains equal to `y` with `z` greater than 0; if `x` is not equal to `y`, then `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and the output is a question mark.***
