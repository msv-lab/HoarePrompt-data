To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze how the program addresses the requirements and verify its logic step by step.

### Problem Breakdown

The task is to determine the voting outcome based on the numbers of upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and unknown votes (`z`). The outcomes can be:
- "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes.
- "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.
- "0" if upvotes equal downvotes.
- "?" if the result is uncertain due to the presence of `z`.

### Program Logic

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input.
2. **Calculating Ranges**: 
   - `min_upvotes` is simply `x`.
   - `max_upvotes` is `x + z` (maximum possible upvotes).
   - `min_downvotes` is `y`.
   - `max_downvotes` is `y + z` (maximum possible downvotes).

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - The first condition checks if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`. If true, it conclusively outputs `-` (downvotes are definitely more).
   - The second condition checks if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`. If true, it conclusively outputs `+` (upvotes are definitely more).
   - If neither condition is true, it outputs `?`, indicating an uncertain result (as there can be multiple scenarios depending on how the `z` unknown votes are cast).

### Detailed Analysis

- **Case with Only Downvotes**: 
  - If `x` is less than `y` (and `z` can be 0), the program correctly identifies that downvotes are dominant.
  
- **Case with Only Upvotes**: 
  - If `y` is less than `x` (and `z` can be 0), it signifies that upvotes are dominant.

- **Equal Votes**: 
  - If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, the result is an exact tie, leading to "0".

- **Uncertain Cases**: 
  - When there are unknown votes (`z > 0`), the program handles uncertainty correctly. For example, if `x + z` could be greater than `y` depending on how many of the unknowns vote up, and vice versa.

### Conclusion

The program captures all possible outcomes as described in the problem statement. Therefore, it evaluates each condition properly, ensuring that it addresses each case, including the uncertain scenario.

Correctness: **True**
