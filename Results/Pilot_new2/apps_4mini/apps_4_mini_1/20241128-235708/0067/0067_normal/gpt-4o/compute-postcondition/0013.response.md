Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, then a string `'-'` has been printed. Otherwise, if `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, it is checked if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`; if so, a string `'+'` has been printed, otherwise, `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.***
