The code snippet provided only contains a print statement that outputs a string and does not modify any variables or values. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between the variables also stay intact. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; the current value of `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes` which means `y + z` is less than `x`; '+' has been printed.**
