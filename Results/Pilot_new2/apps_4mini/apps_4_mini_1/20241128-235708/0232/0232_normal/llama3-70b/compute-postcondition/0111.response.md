To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we consider the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the conditions in the loop.

Initially:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \) and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is initialized to 2.
- `j` starts from `i` and goes up to \( n-1 \) (the loop runs for \( n-i \) iterations).
- `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary, and it will be populated with the counts of colors from the `colors` list.

During the loop:
- For each value of `j`, the loop extracts `color` from the `colors` list and updates `window_counts` by incrementing the count of that color.
- The loop will check if the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`.

After all iterations of the loop have completed:
1. If `n` is equal to 2, the loop will execute only once (for `j=2`), and `window_counts` will contain one entry for `colors[2]` with a count of 1.
2. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will iterate from `j = 2` to `j = n - 1`, thus updating `window_counts` for each color in that range.
3. If during any iteration the counts match the `counts`, `found` will be set to `True`, and it will break out of the loop.
4. If not, `found` will remain `False` after all iterations.

Thus, the output states can be summarized based on the number of times the loop executes:

Output State: **`window_counts` contains counts of colors from indices 2 to `n-1` in `colors`, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, otherwise `found` is False.**
