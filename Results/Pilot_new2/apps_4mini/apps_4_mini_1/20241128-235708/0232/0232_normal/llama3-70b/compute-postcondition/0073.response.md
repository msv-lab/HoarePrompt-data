`window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `window_counts[color]` was incremented by 1, so it was greater than 0 before this assignment. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is 0.**
