The code snippet increments the value of `window_counts[color]` by 1. Given that `color` is `colors[n - 1]` and `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is initially set to 0. After the execution, `window_counts[color]` will equal 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `color` is `colors[n - 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1**.
