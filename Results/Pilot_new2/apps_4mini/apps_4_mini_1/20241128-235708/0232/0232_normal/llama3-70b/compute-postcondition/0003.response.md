The variable `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `colors`, `counts`) remain unchanged, as the initialization of `color_counts` does not affect them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers from the input, `counts` is a list of integers derived from the input, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.**
