Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is 0; `j` is `n-1`; `window_counts` contains the counts of each unique color from the `colors` list; `found` is True, and `color_counts` reflects the original occurrences of colors in `colors`. If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
