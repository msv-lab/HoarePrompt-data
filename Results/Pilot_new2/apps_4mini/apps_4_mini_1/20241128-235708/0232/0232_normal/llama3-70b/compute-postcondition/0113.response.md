The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains counts of colors from indices 2 to `n-1` in `colors`, and `found` is True, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
