Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list and each value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list. If `colors` is empty, `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary.**
