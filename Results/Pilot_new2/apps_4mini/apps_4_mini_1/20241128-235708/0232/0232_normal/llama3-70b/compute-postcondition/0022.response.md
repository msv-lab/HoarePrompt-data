The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. The initial state indicates that `j` is 0. Therefore, `color` will take on the value of the first element in the `colors` list (assuming `colors` is defined elsewhere in the program). The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `color` is colors[0]**
