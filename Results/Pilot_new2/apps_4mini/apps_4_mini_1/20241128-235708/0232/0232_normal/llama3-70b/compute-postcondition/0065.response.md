The value of `window_counts[color]` is set to 0, which updates the state of `window_counts[color]` from 1 to 0. The other variables remain unchanged as the code only modifies `window_counts[color]`. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, `window_counts[color]` is 0.**
