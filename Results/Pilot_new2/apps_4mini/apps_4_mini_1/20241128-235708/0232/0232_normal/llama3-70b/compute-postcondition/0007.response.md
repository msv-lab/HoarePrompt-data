Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list that contains at least 1 color, and `color` is the first color in the `colors` list. If `color` is not already in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `color_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
