Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list that contains at least 3 colors, `color` is the third color in the list. If `color` is not present in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is now set to 0. Otherwise, `color_counts[color]` remains incremented by 1.***
