Output State: **`left` is equal to `original value of n + k + x`, where `x` is the total number of times the loop executed, `right` is equal to the original value of n, `current_counts[colors[left]]` has been decremented multiple times, and for all colors in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is no longer greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]`, indicating the loop has exited. If the loop executed at least once, then `current_counts[color]` was greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]` for all colors initially, but at least one color's count has fallen below the desired count.**
