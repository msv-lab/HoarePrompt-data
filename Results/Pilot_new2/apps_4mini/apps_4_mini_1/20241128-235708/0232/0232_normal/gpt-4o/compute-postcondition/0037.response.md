Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to `original value of n + 2`, `right` is equal to `original value of n`, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]`. If all counts in `current_counts` match their corresponding counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'.***
