The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Since `left` was originally equal to `original value of n + 1`, after the increment, `left` will be equal to `original value of n + 2`. The values of `right` and `current_counts` remain unchanged, as the operation does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to `original value of n + 2`, `right` is equal to `original value of n`, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is reduced by 1 while other counts remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is equal to `original value of n + 2`, `right` is equal to `original value of n`, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is reduced by 1 while other counts remain unchanged.**
