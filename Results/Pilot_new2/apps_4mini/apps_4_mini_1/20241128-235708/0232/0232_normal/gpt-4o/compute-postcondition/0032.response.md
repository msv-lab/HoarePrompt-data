Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to `original value of n + 1`, `right` is equal to the original value of `n`, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is reduced by 1 while other counts remain unchanged. If all colors in `current_counts` match their corresponding counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the operation was successfully executed without violating the constraints on the counts.***
