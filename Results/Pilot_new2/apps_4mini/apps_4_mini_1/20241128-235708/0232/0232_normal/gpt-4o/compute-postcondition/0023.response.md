`current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `left` and `right` are both equal to the original value of `n`, and `current_counts` has counts for all colors equal to their corresponding counts in `desired_counts`. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to the original value of `n`, `right` is equal to the original value of `n`, and `current_counts` for the color at index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`left` is equal to the original value of `n`, `right` is equal to the original value of `n`, `current_counts` for color at index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1.**
