Postcondition: ***If all counts in `current_counts` match the corresponding `desired_counts` for each color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES', confirming that the condition of `current_counts[colors[left]]` having been at least `desired_counts[color] + 1` before decrement is satisfied, and that it remains greater than `desired_counts[color]` for at least one color in `desired_counts`.***
