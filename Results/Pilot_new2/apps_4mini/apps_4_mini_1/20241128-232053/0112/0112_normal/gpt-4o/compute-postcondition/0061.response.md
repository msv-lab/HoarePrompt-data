The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[2]` is True, and `found` is True.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[2]` is True, `found` is True**.
