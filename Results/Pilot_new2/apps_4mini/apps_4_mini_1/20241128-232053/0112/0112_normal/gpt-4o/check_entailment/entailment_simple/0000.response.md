Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Cube Faces Access**: The `can_form_number` function attempts to access a variable `cube_faces` without it being defined in the local scope. This will lead to an error when trying to run the function because `cube_faces` is created inside `func_1` but not passed to `can_form_number`.

2. **Leading Zeros**: The program does not account for the restriction that numbers cannot have leading zeros. For instance, while it can correctly build the number "10" from the cubes, it may incorrectly claim it can build "01", which is not valid as per the problem statement (leading zeros are not allowed).

3. **Digit Matching**: The logic implemented in `can_form_number` does not allow for the proper matching of digits. The problem specifies that Masha cannot create the digit '6' from a '9' and vice versa, but there is no validation in the code to ensure this constraint is checked.

4. **Exhaustive Checking**: While the program aims to find the maximum `x` such that Masha can form all integers from `1` to `x`, the actual checking mechanism for which numbers can be formed is not robust. Specifically, it does not ensure that all numbers from `1` to `x` can indeed be formed sequentially.

Due to these shortcomings, the program cannot be guaranteed to meet the demands of the problem description in all cases. Thus, it is incorrect.
