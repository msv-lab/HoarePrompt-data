The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, indicating that a condition has been satisfied. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` is True; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `0`; `found` is True; `i` is 0; `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` is True; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `0`; `found` is True; `i` is 0; `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[0]**
