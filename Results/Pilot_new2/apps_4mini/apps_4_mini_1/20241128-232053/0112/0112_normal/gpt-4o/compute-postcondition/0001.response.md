The code initializes a list called `used_cubes` with `False` values, where the length of the list is determined by the value of `n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the resulting list will have either 1, 2, or 3 elements, all set to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`.**
