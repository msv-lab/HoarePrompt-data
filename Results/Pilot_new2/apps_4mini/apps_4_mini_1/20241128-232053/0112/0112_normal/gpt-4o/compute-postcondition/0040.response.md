The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` has `used_cubes[i]` set to True for the current value of `i`, which is either 1 or 2; `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
