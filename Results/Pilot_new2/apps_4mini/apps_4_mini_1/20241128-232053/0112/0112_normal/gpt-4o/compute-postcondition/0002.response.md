According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `digits`. For the loop to execute at least once, `digits` must contain at least one element. The current state indicates `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, but this does not provide information about `digits`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to state that `digits` must have at least 1 element. Additionally, since `used_cubes` is initialized, it will remain unchanged in this context. The state of `digit` will depend on the first element of `digits`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, `digits` must have at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`**
