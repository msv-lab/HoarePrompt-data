The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is an integer. The function evaluates several conditions based on the state of certain variables during execution. 

- If none of the conditions for matching are met during the iterations, it returns `False` (Case 1).
- If no cubes have been marked as used, it also returns `False` (Case 2).
- If no matching cube is found during the process, it returns `False` (Case 3).
- If a successful match is found during the iterations, it returns `True` (Case 4).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and determine if it can be formed using the faces of the cubes based on various matching conditions, returning `True` if a match is found and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `num` and returns `True` if a match is successfully found using the cubes; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
