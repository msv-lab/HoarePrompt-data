The variable `used_cubes[i]` is updated to `True`, indicating that the cube at index `i` has been used. The value of `i` remains unchanged at `0`. The other variables retain their previous values since they are not directly affected by this assignment. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3,
- `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`,
- `digits` has at least 1 element,
- `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `0`,
- `found` is False,
- `i` is 0,
- the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is False,
- `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.

After executing the code, the specific change is that `used_cubes[0]` is now `True`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` is True; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `0`; `found` is False; `i` is 0; `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[0]**.
