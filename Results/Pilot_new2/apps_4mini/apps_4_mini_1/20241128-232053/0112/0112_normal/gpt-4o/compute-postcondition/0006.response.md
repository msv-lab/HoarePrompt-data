The code assigns the value `True` to the `i`-th index of the `used_cubes` list. The variable `i` is currently 0, and `used_cubes` is of length `n` with all elements initially set to `False`. Therefore, after execution, the first element of `used_cubes` will be updated to `True`. The other states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to `True` and the remaining elements set to `False`; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is the first element in `digits`; `found` is `False`; `i` is 0; `used_cubes[i]` is `True`; `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.**
