The code `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the value of the list `used_cubes` at index `i` to `True`. Given the initial state, `used_cubes[0]` is already `True`. The value of `i` can be either 1 or 2 depending on its previous value. The list `used_cubes` will now have `used_cubes[i]` set to `True`, which means that at least one more cube has been marked as used.

Since `i` can only take values between 1 and `n-1` (where `n` is 3), the possible states of `used_cubes` after execution could be:
- If `i` was 1, then `used_cubes[1]` becomes `True`.
- If `i` was 2, then `used_cubes[2]` becomes `True`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n` stays as an integer within the range [1, 3], and `found` remains as it was since the code snippet does not modify it. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` has `used_cubes[i]` set to True for the current value of `i`, which is either 1 or 2; `found` remains unchanged.**
