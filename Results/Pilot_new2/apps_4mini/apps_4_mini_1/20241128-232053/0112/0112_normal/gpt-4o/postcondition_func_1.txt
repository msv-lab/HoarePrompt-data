The function accepts an integer `num` and checks whether it can be formed using a set of cubes, where each cube has a set of digits. It returns `True` if every digit in `num` can be matched with a different cube's face without reusing any cube; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function assumes the existence of a global variable `cube_faces`, which contains the digits available on the faces of the cubes, and `n` must be defined within the scope indicating the number of cubes. If the cubes cannot provide a valid combination for all digits in `num`, it returns `False`.
