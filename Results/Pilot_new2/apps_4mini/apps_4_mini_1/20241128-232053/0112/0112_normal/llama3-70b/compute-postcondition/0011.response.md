The `remove` method is called on the `digits` set to remove the string '0'. Since the `digits` set originally contains '0', this string will be removed from it. The initial state indicates that `digits` contains the string '0', so after executing the code, `digits` will no longer contain '0'.

The variables `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of 3 lists of integers; `digits` is a set containing the string representations of all integers from all sublists in `cubes`, excluding '0'.**
