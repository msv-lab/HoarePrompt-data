The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` remain within the range of 1 to 3 as stated in the initial conditions. The states of the other variables are not affected, and the additional lines containing the integers on the faces of the cubes are not modified by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; n is an input integer**
