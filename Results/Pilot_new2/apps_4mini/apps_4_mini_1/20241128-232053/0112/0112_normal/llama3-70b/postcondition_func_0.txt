The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lines of 6 integers each (with each integer in the range 0 to 9) representing the digits on the faces of cubes. It collects all unique digits from these integers, removes '0' if present, and constructs the largest possible integer using the remaining digits. The largest integer is then printed. If all digits are '0', the output will be an empty string since no number will be formed.
