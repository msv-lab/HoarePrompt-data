To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to break down the impact on the variables based on the initial state. 

1. We have `digits`, which is a set containing the string representations of all integers from the sublists in `cubes`. 
2. The code sorts this `digits` set in reverse order and joins the elements into a single string, which is then converted to an integer. 
3. The maximum number created from the sorted string representations of digits is assigned to `max_num`.

Given that `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, and `cubes` contains three lists of integers, the digits extracted from those lists will influence the value of `max_num`. If `0` is included in `digits`, it will be sorted accordingly.

As a result, the output state will include the new value of `max_num` and retain the existing conditions for `n`, `cubes`, and `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of 3 lists of integers; `digits` is a set containing the string representations of all integers from all sublists in `cubes`; `max_num` is an integer formed by sorting `digits` in descending order and joining them into a single number.**
