The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are unchanged and still hold the constraints defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects only the new value of `total_sum`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10; `total_sum` is 0.**
