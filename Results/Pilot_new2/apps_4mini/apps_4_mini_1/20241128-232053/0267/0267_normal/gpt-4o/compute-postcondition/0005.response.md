According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop starts with `num` initialized to `l` and continues until `num` is greater than `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is equal to `num % MOD`, which indicates that `num` is currently at its last value in the loop. Since `num` starts at `l`, if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `num` must have been incremented by 1 in the previous iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `num` should be `num + 1`, and it must still be less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, `num` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and the conditions for `r` remain the same.

State: **`total_sum` is equal to `num % MOD`, where `num` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `r`**
