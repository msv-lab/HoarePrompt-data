The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each parameter is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with values constrained to the range 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function does not return any specific output as there is no output defined in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three positive integers representing the counts of lemons, apples, and pears, but it does not return a value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively.**
