Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). 

Here's why it is incorrect:

1. The variable `min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This is correct; it ensures that we do not exceed the available number of fruits based on the required ratios.

2. However, when the program calculates the total number of fruits to be printed, it uses the formula `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which is `min_lemon * 7`. 

3. The issue arises because `min_lemon` represents the number of lemons used, but it should not directly give us the total amount of fruits. The output should be calculated based on the total counts of lemons, apples, and pears used, which are `min_lemon`, `min_lemon * 2`, and `min_lemon * 4` respectively, and then summed up correctly. 

4. The correct calculation should be: `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4 = min_lemon * 7`, which is what the program outputs, but it doesn't accurately represent the maximum number of fruits used when `min_lemon` is 0, which leads to an output of 0. This is misleading as it does not account for the fact that if no fruits can be used, the result should indeed be 0, but as it stands, there's a misunderstanding in how the output is derived.

5. The program does not handle the case where it should output 0 correctly. Instead, it outputs `0` correctly when `min_lemon` is 0, but it could mislead someone into thinking the logic is sound simply by coincidence.

In conclusion, while the program logically leads to a correct answer in many cases, it does not robustly follow the problem description in its reasoning and could lead to misunderstandings. Hence, it fails to meet the problem requirements in a clear and consistent manner.
