Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use based on the given ratio of 1:2:4. It does this by determining the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available quantities of apples and pears, which is done by taking the minimum of:

- The number of lemons (`a`)
- Half the number of apples (`b // 2`) since for every lemon, 2 apples are needed
- A quarter of the number of pears (`c // 4`) since for every lemon, 4 pears are needed

Once it determines the maximum lemons that can be used (`max_lemons`), it correctly calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which effectively gives the total number of fruits in the ratio specified.

The handling of edge cases where there are not enough fruits (like having no pears) is also appropriately managed, returning a total of 0 when necessary.

All provided examples in the problem description yield the expected outputs, confirming the program's correctness.
