Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is 0, no further actions are taken. If `c` is not 0, 'YES' is printed if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
