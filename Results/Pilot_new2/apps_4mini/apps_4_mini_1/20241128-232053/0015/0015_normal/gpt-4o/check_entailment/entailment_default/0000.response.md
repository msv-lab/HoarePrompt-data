Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem description:
The sequence starts with an integer `a` and has a common difference `c`. We need to check if a favorite integer `b` appears in this sequence.

### Program:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Equality Check**: The code correctly checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If so, it prints "YES".
2. **Zero Difference Case**: If `c` is 0, the sequence becomes constant and only contains the value `a`. Therefore, if `b` is not equal to `a`, it correctly prints "NO".
3. **General Case**: For non-zero `c`, it checks whether `(b - a) % c == 0` ensuring that `b` can be reached through steps of size `c`, and whether the resulting number of steps `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, indicating that we can reach `b` from `a` without going backwards.

### Edge Cases:
The program seems to cover the core cases as per the problem description. However, the conditions regarding the step `c` could be more clearly evaluated:

- If `c` is positive and `b < a`, it cannot be reached, which is handled correctly (`(b - a) / c` will be negative).
- If `c` is negative and `b > a`, it cannot be reached either, which is also handled correctly (again, `(b - a) / c` will be negative).

### Output Hints:
The output hints suggest:
- If `b` is equal to `a`, print "YES".
- If `c` is zero and `b` is not equal to `a`, print "NO".
- For non-zero `c`, check if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`.

The hints agree with the logic implemented in the code, and they help clarify that the output follows the needed conditions for when `b` appears in the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if the integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`. It handles edge cases related to the values of `c`, and the outputs align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
