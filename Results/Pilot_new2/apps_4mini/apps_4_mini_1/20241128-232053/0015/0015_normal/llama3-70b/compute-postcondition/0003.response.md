The `print` statement outputs 'YES', but it does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`. The values of `a` and `b` remain equal, and `c` stays at 0. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values. The current value of `c` is 0. The values of `a` and `b` are equal (a == b), and 'YES' is printed.**
