Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description to determine if Vasya's favorite integer \( b \) appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by the first term \( a \) and the common difference \( c \).

### Explanation of Correctness:

1. **Handling the case when `c == 0`**:
   - If the common difference \( c \) is zero, the sequence consists of only one repeated element \( a \) (i.e., the sequence is \( [a, a, a, \ldots] \)).
   - The program checks if \( a \) equals \( b \). If they are equal, it correctly prints "YES" (indicating that \( b \) appears in the sequence); otherwise, it prints "NO".

2. **Handling the case when `c != 0`**:
   - When \( c \) is non-zero, the sequence progresses as \( a, a + c, a + 2c, \ldots \).
   - The program checks if the difference \( b - a \) is divisible by \( c \) (`(b - a) % c == 0`). This checks if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \).
   - Additionally, it checks if \( (b - a) / c \geq 0 \). This ensures that the position \( i \) (given by the quotient) is a valid positive index (i.e., \( i \) must be non-negative).

### Coverage of Edge Cases:
- The conditions handle all edge cases, including when \( a \), \( b \), or \( c \) are negative, zero, or at their limits (i.e., \(-10^9\) or \(10^9\)).
- The checks ensure that the outputs are correct for all conceivable inputs within the specified range.

Hence, the program adheres to the problem's requirements and provides the correct output for all specified cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified as true.
