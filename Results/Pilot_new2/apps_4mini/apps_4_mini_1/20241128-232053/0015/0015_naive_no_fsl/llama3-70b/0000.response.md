Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. 

Here's the reasoning for each part of the implementation:

1. **When `c` is 0**: 
   - The sequence has no variation and consists of the single repeated element `a`. The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it correctly outputs "YES". If not, it outputs "NO". This accurately addresses the case where `c = 0`.

2. **When `c` is not 0**:
   - The program checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`. This ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding some integer multiple of `c`. 
   - Additionally, it checks that `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which confirms that the sequence can move towards `b` (i.e., `b` must be reached by moving forward in the sequence if `c` is positive, or that `b` is reachable if `c` is negative).

The program successfully handles all specified edge cases and correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. There are no potential cases where the program fails to produce the correct output as per the given problem description.
