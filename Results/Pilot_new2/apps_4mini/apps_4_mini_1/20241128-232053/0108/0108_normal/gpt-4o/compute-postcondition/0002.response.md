The variable `target_len` is assigned the value of `len(target)`, which computes the length of the string `target`. Since `target` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, its length is 26. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26**.
