The variable `target` is assigned the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, which represents all the lowercase English letters. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of `s` and the new value of `target`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
