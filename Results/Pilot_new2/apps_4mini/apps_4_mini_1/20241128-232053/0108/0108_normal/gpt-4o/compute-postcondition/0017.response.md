Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to the number of characters from `target` that were found in `s` in order (which can be between 0 and 26), and if `j` is less than 26 then `s` does not contain all characters of `target` in the required order; if `j` is equal to 26, then `s` contains all characters of `target` in order.**
