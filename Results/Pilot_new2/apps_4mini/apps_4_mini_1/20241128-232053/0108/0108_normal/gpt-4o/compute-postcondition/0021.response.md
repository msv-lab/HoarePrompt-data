The code `print(-1)` outputs `-1` but does not change any variable states. The variables `i` and `j` retain their previous values with no modifications. Since `j` is less than 26 and `s` does not contain all characters of `target` in the required order, this condition still holds true after execution.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to the number of characters from `target` that were found in `s` in order (which can be between 0 and 26), and `j` is less than 26. The output is -1.**
