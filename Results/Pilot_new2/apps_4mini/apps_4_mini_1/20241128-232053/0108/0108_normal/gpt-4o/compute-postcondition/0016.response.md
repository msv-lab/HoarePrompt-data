The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so it will now hold a value that is one greater than its previous value, which is less than `len(s)`. The values of `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is less than `len(s)` and `i` is increased by 1.**
