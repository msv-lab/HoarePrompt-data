The function `func` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, where the length of `s` can range from 1 to 100,000 characters. It processes the string to generate a new string `res`, which consists of characters from 'a' to 'z' based on their occurrences in `s`. For each character in the alphabet, it appends that character to `res` for every occurrence found in `s`, replacing each occurrence with the next character in the alphabet (i.e., 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', etc.). If `s` contains a character that exceeds 'z', it stops processing those characters.

After processing, if the length of `res` is exactly 26, it prints `res`, which would be "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", indicating that all characters from 'a' to 'z' were found. If not all characters are found (i.e., the length of `res` is less than 26), it prints `-1`.

It is important to note that if the input string contains characters other than lowercase letters (like uppercase letters or special characters), those characters are ignored in the processing, and the function will still attempt to print the result based only on the lowercase letters present.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` of lowercase English letters, constructs a string by appending each letter from 'a' to 'z' according to their occurrences in `s`, and prints the constructed string if it contains all letters from 'a' to 'z'; otherwise, it prints -1. It ignores any characters in `s` that are not lowercase letters. **
