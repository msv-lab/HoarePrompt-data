The function accepts a string `s` of lowercase English letters, constructs a string by appending each letter from 'a' to 'z' according to their occurrences in `s`, and prints the constructed string if it contains all letters from 'a' to 'z'; otherwise, it prints -1. It ignores any characters in `s` that are not lowercase letters.
