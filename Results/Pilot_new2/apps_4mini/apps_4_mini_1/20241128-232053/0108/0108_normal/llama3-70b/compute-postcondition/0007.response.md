According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue as long as `char` is found within `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'b' and `char` is 'a', which is not in `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be equal to 'b' (since `s` is 'b') or `s` must contain the current value of `char`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `char` is equal to 'b'.

State: **`s` is 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` must be 'b'**
