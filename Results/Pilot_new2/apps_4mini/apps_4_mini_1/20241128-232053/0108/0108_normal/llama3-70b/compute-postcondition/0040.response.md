The code snippet contains a print statement that outputs `-1`. There are no variables being modified or any conditions affecting the values of `s`, `res`, or `char`. The state of those variables remains unchanged after the execution of the print statement. 

Since the task simply prints `-1` and does not alter any variable states, the output will reflect the initial conditions that remain valid.

Output State: **`s` is empty or contains characters greater than 'z', `res` is the concatenation of all characters from 'a' to 'z' according to their occurrences in the original string, `char` is beyond 'z', indicating that all characters from 'a' to 'z' have been processed, and the length of `res` is less than 26.**
