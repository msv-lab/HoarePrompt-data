Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` is a set containing at least the integer `a[0]` with at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
