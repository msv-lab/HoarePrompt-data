Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is True if there exists some element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such `x` is found, `can_form` remains False.**
