Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[n-1]`. If the difference (a[i] - x) is an element of `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to `True`, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, and `x` is the first element of `assigned`. In this case, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
