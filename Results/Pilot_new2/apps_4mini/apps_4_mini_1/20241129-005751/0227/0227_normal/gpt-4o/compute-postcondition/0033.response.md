The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
