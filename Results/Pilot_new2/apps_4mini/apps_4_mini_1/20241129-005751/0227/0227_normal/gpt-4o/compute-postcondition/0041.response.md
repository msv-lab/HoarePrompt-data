The value of `m` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, `m` is 3, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is False.
