Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes elements from `a`, `can_form` is True if any `a[i] - x` is in `assigned` for some `x` in `assigned`, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, and `x` is the last element of `assigned` checked. If `assigned` is empty, then `can_form` remains False.**
