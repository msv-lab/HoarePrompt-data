Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` has at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
