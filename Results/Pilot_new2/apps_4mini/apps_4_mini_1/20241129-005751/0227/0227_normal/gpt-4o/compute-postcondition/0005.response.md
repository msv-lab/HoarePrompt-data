`can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` is a set containing the integer `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is `False`.
