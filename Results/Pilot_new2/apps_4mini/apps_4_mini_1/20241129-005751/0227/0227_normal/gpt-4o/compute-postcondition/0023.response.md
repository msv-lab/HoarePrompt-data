The code snippet `assigned.add(a[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the set `assigned`. Given that `i` is 1, it adds `a[1]` to `assigned`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `n` is greater than 1, `a[1]` is guaranteed to be a distinct positive integer. 

The `assigned` set will now include `a[1]` in addition to `a[0]` which was already a member of `assigned`. The other variables `m`, `i`, and `can_form` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order; `assigned` includes at least `a[0]` and now also includes `a[1]`; `m` is 2; `i` is 1; `can_form` is False.**
