The variable `m` is assigned the value of 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers that satisfy 1 <= `a_k` <= 10^9; `m` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers that satisfy 1 <= `a_k` <= 10^9; `m` is 1**.
