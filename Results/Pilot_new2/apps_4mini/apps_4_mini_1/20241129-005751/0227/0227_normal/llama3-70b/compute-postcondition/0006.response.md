The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is 1, so after the increment, `m` will become 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 <= `a_k` <= 10^9, `m` is 2, and the current value of `a[1]` is not equal to `a[0] * 2.**
