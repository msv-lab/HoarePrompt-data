The variables `n` and `k` are assigned new values based on user input, where `map(int, input().split())` takes two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `n` and `k` will be whatever integers the user inputs, but they will still satisfy the conditions of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The output state will reflect that `n` and `k` now hold these input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18**
