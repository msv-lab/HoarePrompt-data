The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. No variables are modified or returned since the program does not continue past this point. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer such that k is greater than or equal to 3; `seen` now contains `n % 3`; `i` is 3; `remainder` is equal to `n % 3; 'No' has been printed; program execution has been terminated.**
