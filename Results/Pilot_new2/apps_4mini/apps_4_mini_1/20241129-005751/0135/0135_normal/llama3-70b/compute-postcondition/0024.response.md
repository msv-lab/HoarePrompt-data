Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where both are between 1 and 10^18. It computes the unique remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during this process, the function outputs 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it outputs 'Yes'. The function does not have any return value as it only prints the result directly. **
