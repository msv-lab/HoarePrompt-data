The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters according to the provided definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\). The output behavior of the function is not explicitly provided in this case, so we cannot determine the specific return values or conditions based on input parameters. 

Therefore, as the function is currently described, we cannot ascertain its functionality regarding how it processes or returns values related to `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly and the output behavior is not defined based on the given description.**
