According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `k`. The loop will execute for `i` in the range from 1 to `k + 1`, which means it will run as long as `k` is at least 1. The conditions specify that `k` is less than `n`, and since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute.

Before the loop starts, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and this state does not affect the loop execution directly. The loop variable `i` will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop execution.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:
- `i` is initialized to 1 (the starting point of the loop).
- Since `k` is already specified to be at least 1, there is no additional adjustment needed for `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is less than `n`, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
