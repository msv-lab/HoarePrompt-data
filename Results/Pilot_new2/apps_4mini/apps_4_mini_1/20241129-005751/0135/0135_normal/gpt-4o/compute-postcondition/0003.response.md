The code initializes `seen_remainders` as an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, maintaining the conditions that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` < `n`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is less than `n`, and `seen_remainders` is an empty set.**
