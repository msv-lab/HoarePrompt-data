To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and consider potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. The program checks if all remainders of `n` when divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct.
2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns 'No' immediately, which is correct according to the problem description since `n % i` will repeat for `i = 1` and `i = n`.
3. The program uses a set to keep track of the remainders encountered. If a remainder is seen again, it returns 'No'.
4. If all the remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases to Consider:

- The program does not check for any cases where `k` could be zero or negative; however, the problem constraints state that `k` is always at least `1`. So, within the problem constraints, this check is unnecessary.
- The only scenario where the remainders could overlap would be for values of `k` that are greater than or equal to `n`, which is already handled.
  
### Output Hints Analysis:

The output hints confirm that the function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, and also checks for duplicate remainders. It also states that if all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'. The hints align with the logical flow of the code and do not introduce any new cases outside of the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program adheres to the problem description and handles the expected edge cases correctly. There are no scenarios where the code fails within the constraints provided. 

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly checks for distinct remainders of `n % i` for given `k`, following the problem description accurately.
