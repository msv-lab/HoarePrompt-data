def func_1(n, k):

        #The program returns 'No' since the current value of k is greater than or equal to the current value of n, where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.

        remainder = n % i

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders from the executions of `n % i` for `i` in the range from `1` to `k`, which may include duplicate values if a remainder was found more than once.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes', indicating that the condition associated with the unique remainders from the executions of `n % i` for `i` in the range from `1` to `k` has been satisfied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where both are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^18. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainder from the calculations of `n % i` (for `i` from 1 to `k`) is found to be a duplicate, indicating a cycle. If all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where `k` is 0 or negative, which are outside the given constraints.
