Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is at least 3; `seen_remainders` includes `0` and `1`; `i` is 3; and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the program returns 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, the program does not return any value.***
