The `seen_remainders` set will now include the current value of `remainder`. As per the initial state, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and both of these values are already in `seen_remainders`. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the program would return 'No', but since the code only adds `remainder` to the set and does not return any value, we only need to update the state based on the addition.

Since `remainder` can be either 0 or 1, the addition of `remainder` will not change the contents of `seen_remainders`. Therefore, after executing the code, `seen_remainders` still remains the same with both values already present.

The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is at least 3; `seen_remainders` includes `0` and `1`; `i` is 3; `remainder` is either 0 or 1; `seen_remainders` remains unchanged.**
