To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), \( a \), and \( b \) correctly. 
2. **Floor and Block Calculation**: 
   - It calculates the floor where Edward lives (`a_floor`) and where Natasha lives (`b_floor`) using the formula:
     - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1`
     - `b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1`
   - It calculates the block (or подъезд) where Edward lives (`a_block`) and where Natasha lives (`b_block`) as:
     - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
     - `b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
3. **Block Transition Time Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates the minimum time required to transition between blocks using:
     - `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`
   - This correctly accounts for the circular nature of the building.
4. **Floor Transition Time Calculation**:
   - It then determines the time to transition between floors. The logic appears incorrect here:
     - `if a_floor > b_floor:` calculates time depending on the direction of the floor movement but the formula should account for whether Edward is using stairs or taking the lift.
     - The lift time itself is not correctly integrated into the total time when going down from `a_floor` to `1` (which takes 10 seconds wait + \( x \) seconds for moving floors).

5. **Final Output**: The program sums the calculated times for block and floor transitions and prints the result.

### Edge Case Analysis

1. **Single Block/Single Floor**: 
   For \( n = 1 \), \( m = 1 \), \( k = 1 \), and apartments \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \) (which is impossible and contradicts the problem statement ensuring \( a \) and \( b \) are different). 
   If we simulate:
   - Then it should output correctly based on the logic.
  
2. **Directly Above/Below**: 
   If Edward and Natasha are directly above/below each other, the lift time is not considered correctly in the program for downward movements.

3. **Circular Movement**: 
   If Edward is in block \( n \) and Natasha in block \( 1 \), the program calculates the block transition correctly, but timing for floors might not be valid if it assumes direct access without the waiting time for the lift.

### Conclusion

Based on the reasoning above, I can identify a case where the program does not work correctly:
- When transitioning between floors using the lift. The program does not accurately account for the waiting time and journey time properly in all scenarios, particularly when moving downwards from a higher floor.

Therefore, the conclusion of correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
