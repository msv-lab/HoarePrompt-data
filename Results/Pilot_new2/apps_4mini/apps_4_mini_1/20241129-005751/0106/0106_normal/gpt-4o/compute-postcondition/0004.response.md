The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The parameter `apartment` is an integer representing an apartment number, with the constraint that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k, where n, m, and k are positive integers each ranging from 1 to 1000. The function returns the block and floor values based on the calculations involving the apartment numbers `a` and `b`. Specifically, the block is calculated as either (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 or (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and the floor is calculated as floor_within_block // k + 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding block and floor values based on the given calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment representing an apartment number and returns the corresponding block and floor values based on the calculations related to the given apartment number.**
