The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers such that both are within the range of 1 to `n·m·k` and `a` is not equal to `b`. 

Based on the output description:
- The function evaluates certain conditions based on these integer values and returns a result. However, the specific return values are not provided in the output description.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can only be described in terms of the constraints on the integers involved. 

Functionality: **The function operates on integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b) but does not directly accept parameters or specify return values.**
