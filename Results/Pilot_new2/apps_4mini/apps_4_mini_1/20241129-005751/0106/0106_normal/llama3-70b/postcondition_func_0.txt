The function accepts two integer pairs, n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b) from user input. It computes the minimum time taken to travel between two specified floors (derived from a and b) within a multi-block structure, where each block's time to move vertically is calculated based on the floor difference and the number of blocks. The total time is determined by the block movement time and the floor movement time, which is then printed. The function does not return a value but outputs the computed total time directly.
