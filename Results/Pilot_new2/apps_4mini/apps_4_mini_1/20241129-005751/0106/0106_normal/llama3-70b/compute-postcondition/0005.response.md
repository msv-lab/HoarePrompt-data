The variable `b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `b`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the specified range, and the output will reflect the calculation based on the current values of `b`, `m`, and `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers assigned from input values where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
