The code assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `k` using the `map` function with `input()`. The input will accept three integers separated by spaces, which will then be converted to integers and assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The other variables (`a` and `b`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values, where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
