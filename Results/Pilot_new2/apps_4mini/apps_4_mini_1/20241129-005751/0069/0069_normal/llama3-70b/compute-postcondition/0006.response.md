Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the current value of `balance` is equal to `x`.***
