You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of 0-s and 1-s. You build an infinite string $t$ as a concatenation of an infinite number of strings $s$, or $t = ssss \dots$ For example, if $s =$ 10010, then $t =$ 100101001010010...

Calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$. The balance of some string $q$ is equal to $cnt_{0, q} - cnt_{1, q}$, where $cnt_{0, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 0 in $q$, and $cnt_{1, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 1 in $q$. The number of such prefixes can be infinite; if it is so, you must say that.

A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string "abcd" has 5 prefixes: empty string, "a", "ab", "abc" and "abcd".


-----Input-----

The first line contains the single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Next $2T$ lines contain descriptions of test cases — two lines per test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$) — the length of string $s$ and the desired balance, respectively.

The second line contains the binary string $s$ ($|s| = n$, $s_i \in \{\text{0}, \text{1}\}$).

It's guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ doesn't exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

Print $T$ integers — one per test case. For each test case print the number of prefixes or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such prefixes.


-----Example-----
Input
4
6 10
010010
5 3
10101
1 0
0
2 0
01

Output
3
0
1
-1



-----Note-----

In the first test case, there are 3 good prefixes of $t$: with length $28$, $30$ and $32$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, x is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, and s is a binary string of length n where each character is either '0' or '1'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt0, cnt1 = s.count('0'), s.count('1')
        
        balance = cnt0 - cnt1
        
        if balance == x:
            print(n + 1)
        elif (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, for each iteration: `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. After all iterations, the outputs depend on the comparisons made within each loop iteration: if `balance` equals `x`, the printed value is `n + 1` for those cases; if `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed; otherwise, the printed value is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, assuming `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the output conditions may lead to no value being printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It counts the occurrences of '0's and '1's in `s`, computes a balance as the difference between these counts, and determines specific outputs based on the relationship between `balance` and `x`. If `balance` equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between the counts of '0' and '1', it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the formula `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. However, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the division is undefined and may lead to no output for some cases.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
