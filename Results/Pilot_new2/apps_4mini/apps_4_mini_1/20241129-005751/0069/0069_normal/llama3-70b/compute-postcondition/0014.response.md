Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the current value of `balance` is equal to `x`, then `n + 1` is printed. Otherwise, if `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, then -1 has been printed. If `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is zero or `(x - balance)` is not divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, then no specific action is taken.***
