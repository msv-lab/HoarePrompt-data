Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 2, and `b` is undefined (as there is no next element in the list) if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`.***
