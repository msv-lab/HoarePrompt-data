Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, and the current value of `x` satisfies that (x - b) is divisible by `balance` and (x - b) // balance is greater than or equal to 0.**
