The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` represents a value from the `data` list at the current iteration index. This means that `n` will now be equal to whatever integer is stored at that specific `index` in the `data` list. The previous value of `i`, which was equal to the previous value of `n`, will now be invalidated as `n` is updated. However, since `i` is not directly updated in this code snippet, it will retain the old value unless further modified later. The list `prefix_balances` remains unchanged as well. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `i` is equal to the previous value of `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `_` will be equal to the current iteration index incremented by 1.**
