The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, except for `results`, which now includes an additional element. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance`, `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, the current value of `balance` is 0, `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, and `results` has an additional value of `0`.**
