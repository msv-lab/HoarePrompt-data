The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data` is a list of strings, and `index` is currently 1. Thus, `x` is updated to the integer value of the string located at `data[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is []**
