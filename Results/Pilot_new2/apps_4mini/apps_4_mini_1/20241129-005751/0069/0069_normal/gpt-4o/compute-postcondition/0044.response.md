The variable `index` is incremented by 3. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, `x`, `s`) remain unchanged. Specifically, `index` now holds the value of `index + 3`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `index` is equal to `index + 3`, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]**
