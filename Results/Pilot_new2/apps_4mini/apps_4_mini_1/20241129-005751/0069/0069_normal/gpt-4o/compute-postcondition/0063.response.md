Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0. The value of `x` minus `b` is divisible by `balance` and the result of dividing `x - b` by `balance` is greater than or equal to 0.***
