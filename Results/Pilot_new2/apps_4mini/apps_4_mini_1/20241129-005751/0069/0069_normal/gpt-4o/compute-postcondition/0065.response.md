Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance`, `balance` is not equal to 0. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is set to 1.***
