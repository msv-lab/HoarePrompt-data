According to the code, the loop will execute `T` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which indicates that the loop has finished one iteration. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly used to track progress, we simply need to check the value of `T`.

Given that `T` is a positive integer and the loop will execute for each iteration until `_` reaches `T-1`, the next iteration will occur if the current iteration is less than `T`. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that the next iteration will be executed, and `_` will increment.

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `_` will be equal to the current iteration index (which is now incremented by 1).**
