The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The value of `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, and since `data[index + 1]` is accessed, the specific value of `x` will depend on the content of the `data` list at that index.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `i` is equal to the previous value of `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `_` will be equal to the current iteration index incremented by 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`**.
