The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, hence after executing the code, the new value of `index` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is [].
