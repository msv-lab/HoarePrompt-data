The variable `prefix_balances` is assigned a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `prefix_balances` now holds `n + 1` zeroes.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer from `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is [], `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.**
