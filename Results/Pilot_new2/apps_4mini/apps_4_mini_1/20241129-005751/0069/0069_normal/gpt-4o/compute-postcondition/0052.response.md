The code modifies `prefix_balances[i]` based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to be equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus either `1` or `-1`, depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is `'0'` or not. Since the specific values of `s` and `prefix_balances` are not provided, we cannot determine exact values for `prefix_balances[i]`, but we know that it will depend on the value of `s`.

Given that `i` is `3`, `prefix_balances[i]` will be updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the condition involving `s[2]`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[2]` is equal to `prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1), `prefix_balances[3]` is equal to `prefix_balances[2] + (1 if s[2] == '0' else -1)**
