To analyze the for loop, we need to consider how the loop operates based on the variables given. The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 2, meaning that `n` can be 2 or greater.
- The loop's range is from 1 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute while `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Since `i` is currently 2, we need to determine if it will execute again. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

- Therefore, before the next iteration, `i` would become 3.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (because `i` must be less than or equal to `n`).

Thus, we can express the adjusted states as follows:

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[2]` is equal to `prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1)**
