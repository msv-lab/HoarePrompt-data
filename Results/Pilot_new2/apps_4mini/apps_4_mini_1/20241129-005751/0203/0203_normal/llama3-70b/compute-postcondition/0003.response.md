The variable `remocrats` is assigned the value of 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**.
