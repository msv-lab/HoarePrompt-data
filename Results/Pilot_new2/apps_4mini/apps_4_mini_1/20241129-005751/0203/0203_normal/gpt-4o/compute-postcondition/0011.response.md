The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The variable `i` holds the index of the last processed character, which is less than `n - 1`. This operation modifies the state of `d_queue` by adding a new element, but the values of `n`, `votes`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is the index of the last processed character (which must be less than n-1); `v` is the next character in `votes` corresponding to index `i + 1`; `d_queue` has the value `i` appended to it.**
