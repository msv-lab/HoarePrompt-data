Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string. If the first character of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains 0, and `r_queue` is empty. Otherwise, `d_queue` is empty, and `r_queue` contains 0, indicating that the first character of `votes` is not 'D'.***
