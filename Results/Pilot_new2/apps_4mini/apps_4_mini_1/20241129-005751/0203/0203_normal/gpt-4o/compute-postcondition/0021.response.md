`r_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `r_queue`, which is removed from the list (indicated by `pop(0)`). The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged, but now `r_queue` will have one less element. As `d_queue` is stated to contain at least one index, we assume `r_queue` also has elements to pop. 

Output State: **`d_queue` contains at least one less index, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`.**
