The variable `r_queue` is modified by appending a new element, which is the value of `r_index` incremented by `n`. The values of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `r_index` remain unchanged. The specific value of the append operation will depend on the current value of `r_index` and `n`. Therefore, the output state will include the updated information about `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains at least one less index, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` now contains `r_index + n`.**
