Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one more element than before and `r_queue` has one less element than before, if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, and `d_queue` contains the new element `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `d_queue` has one less element than before, `r_queue` has one more element (the new element is `r_index + n`), and `r_index` remains unchanged as the first element of the original `r_queue`.***
