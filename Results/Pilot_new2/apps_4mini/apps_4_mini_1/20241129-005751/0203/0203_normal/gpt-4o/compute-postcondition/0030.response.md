The value of `d_index` is used in the computation for appending to `d_queue`. The code appends `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The `d_index` retains its value from the initial state, and `n` is a variable that hasn't been defined but contributes to the calculation. The `r_index` and `r_queue` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`d_queue` now contains its previous elements plus the value of `d_index + n`, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` contains at least one index less than before.**
