The code appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, and the state of `r_queue` is updated to include the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is the index of the last processed character (which must be less than n-1); `v` is the next character in `votes` corresponding to index `i + 1`; `r_queue` now includes the value `i`.**
