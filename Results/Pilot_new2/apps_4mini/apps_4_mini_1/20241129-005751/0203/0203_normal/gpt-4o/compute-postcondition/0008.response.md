The code appends the current value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The value of `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `r_queue` will contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains 0, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of `votes`, and `v` is not equal to 'D'.**
