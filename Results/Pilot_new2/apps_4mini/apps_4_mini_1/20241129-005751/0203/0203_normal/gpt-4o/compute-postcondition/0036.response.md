The value of `d_index` is not specified, but `n` is an added value. The operation `d_queue.append(d_index + n)` adds the result of the expression `d_index + n` to the `d_queue`, which increases its length by one. The states of `r_queue` and `r_index` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element than before, `r_queue` has one less element than before, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `d_queue` contains the new element `d_index + n`.**
