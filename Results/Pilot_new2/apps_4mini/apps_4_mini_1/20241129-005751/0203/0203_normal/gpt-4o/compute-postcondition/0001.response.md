The variable `votes` is assigned the value returned by `input().strip()`, which reads a line of input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string resulting from input with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**
