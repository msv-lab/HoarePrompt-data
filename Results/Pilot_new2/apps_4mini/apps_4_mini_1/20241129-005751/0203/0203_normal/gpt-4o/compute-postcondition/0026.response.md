Postcondition: ***`d_queue` contains at least one less index, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` now contains an additional element `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` now contains `r_index + n`.***
