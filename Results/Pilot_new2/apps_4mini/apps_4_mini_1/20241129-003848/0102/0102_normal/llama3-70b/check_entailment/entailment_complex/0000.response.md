Correctness: **True**

The program correctly meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Range**: The program correctly accepts an integer input `s` constrained between 0 and 99, inclusive, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Output Format**: The program generates the English word representation of the number `s` and ensures that the output consists only of lowercase letters and hyphens, with no spaces, aligning with the output requirements.

3. **Handling Specific Ranges**:
   - For values of `s` less than 10, the program accurately retrieves the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
   - For values between 10 and 19, it correctly utilizes the `teens` list to obtain the appropriate word.
   - For values from 20 to 99, it correctly constructs the word representation by combining the appropriate string from the `tens` list with the string from the `ones` list, using a hyphen to connect them as necessary.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases effectively:
   - For `s = 0`, it returns an empty string which is acceptable since there is no word representation for zero in the provided lists.
   - The construction of combined words (like "twenty-one") is implemented correctly using the condition to check when `s % 10` is not zero.

5. **No Return Value**: The program prints the output directly as required by the problem description, which does not specify that a return value is needed.

Overall, the program's logic is sound and rigorously adheres to the specifications laid out in the problem description for all possible input values.
