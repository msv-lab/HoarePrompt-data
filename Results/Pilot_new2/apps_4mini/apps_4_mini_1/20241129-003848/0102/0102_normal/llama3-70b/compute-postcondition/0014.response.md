Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for an integer input `s` in the range 0 to 99. It then prints the English word representation of the number. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the word from the `tens` list followed by the word from the `ones` list if necessary (e.g., "twenty-one"). There is no return value from the function.**
