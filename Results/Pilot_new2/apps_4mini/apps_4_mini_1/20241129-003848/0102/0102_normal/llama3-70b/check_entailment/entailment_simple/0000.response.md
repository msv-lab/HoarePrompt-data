Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes an integer score `s` (where \(0 \leq s \leq 99\)) as input and converts that score into its English word representation.

Hereâ€™s how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer input between 0 and 99, which aligns with the constraints provided in the problem description.

2. **Output Requirements**: 
   - The program defines three lists: `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` to represent the word forms of the numbers.
   - It handles three cases:
     - If `s` is less than 10, it directly retrieves the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
     - If `s` is between 10 and 19 inclusive, it retrieves the corresponding word from the `teens` list.
     - If `s` is 20 or greater, it constructs the word representation by combining the appropriate word from the `tens` list with the word from the `ones` list when needed (using a hyphen if necessary).

3. **Hyphenation**: The program uses hyphens correctly when constructing words for numbers like 21 (twenty-one), 35 (thirty-five), etc., ensuring that the output is consistent with the problem requirements.

4. **Word Representation**: The output consists only of English lowercase letters and hyphens, as specified in the problem description.

Overall, every possible input case from 0 to 99 is handled correctly, and the output format adheres to the requirements. The program accounts for all specified conditions and generates the correct textual representations for all valid inputs.
