You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

You can find all you need to know about English numerals in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99.
def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven',
    'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    if (0 <= n <= 9) :
        return ones[n]
        #The program returns the English word representation of the integer `s`, which is between 0 and 9, inclusive, from the list `ones`.
    else :
        if (11 <= n <= 19) :
            return teens[n - 10]
            #The program returns the corresponding string for the integer value n which is between 11 and 19 inclusive, by accessing the 'teens' list at the index n - 10.
        else :
            if (10 <= n <= 99) :
                if (n % 10 == 0) :
                    return tens[n // 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of the tens place for the integer `n`, which is a multiple of 10 and in the range of 10 to 99, based on the `tens` list.
                else :
                    return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of `n` in the format of tens and ones, where `tens[n // 10]` provides the ten's place word and `ones[n % 10]` provides the one's place word for `n` in the range of 10 to 99, and `n` is not a multiple of 10.
            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99; `ones` is ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']; `teens` is ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']; `tens` is ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']; `n` is not in the range of 10 to 99 (i.e., `n` < 10 or `n` > 99) and `n` is not in the range of 11 to 19 (i.e., `n` < 11 or `n` > 19).
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99; `ones` is ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']; `teens` is ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']; `tens` is ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']; `n` is not in the range of 10 to 99 (i.e., `n` < 10 or `n` > 99) and `n` is not in the range of 11 to 19 (i.e., `n` < 11 or `n` > 19).
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99; `ones` is ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']; `teens` is ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']; `tens` is ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']; `n` is not in the range of 10 to 99 (i.e., `n` < 10 or `n` > 99) and `n` is not in the range of 11 to 19 (i.e., `n` < 11 or `n` > 19).

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
