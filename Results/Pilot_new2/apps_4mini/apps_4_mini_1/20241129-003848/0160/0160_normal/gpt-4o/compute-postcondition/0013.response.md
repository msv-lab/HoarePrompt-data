Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer `N`, the second element is a non-negative integer `K`, and the third element is a list of `N` positive integers `A`. If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is incremented by 1, and `divisors` includes the new value of `N // (i + 1)`.***
