The value of `i` is incremented by 1, which means its new value is now `i + 1`. The variable `divisors` then includes the new value `x // (i + 1)`, where `x` is a tuple containing three elements: the first element `N`, the second element `K`, and the third element which is a list of `N` positive integers `A`. The first element `N` is a positive integer, and dividing it by `i + 1` will yield a new integer value (using floor division). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer `N`, the second element is a non-negative integer `K`, and the third element is a list of `N` positive integers `A`; `i` is now incremented by 1; `divisors` includes the new value of `N // (i + 1)`.**
