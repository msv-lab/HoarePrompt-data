Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer `N` (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer `K` (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` positive integers `A` (1 <= A_i <= 10^6). If `x % i == 0`, then `divisors` now includes the values 2 and `N // 2`.***
