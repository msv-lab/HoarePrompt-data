The `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The value of `i` is equal to `N + 1`, and `max_divisor` will either retain its current value or take the value of `i`, depending on which is larger. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the possible updated state of `max_divisor`.

Output State: **`K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9; `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N + 1) * (N + 1)`; `i` is equal to `N + 1`; `max_divisor` is max(`max_divisor`, `N + 1`)**
