Postcondition: ***`K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than 0, `i` is N-1, `max_divisor` is the maximum between `gcd` and `N-1`. The current value of `i` is N-1, and it is true that `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.***
