Postcondition: ***`K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9; `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `gcd` is greater than 0; `i` is N, with `N` less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`.***
