To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze what the program is doing in relation to the specified requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Given two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), we need to find the minimum positive integer `x` such that:
   - `x` ends with `k` or more zeros in base 10.
   - `x` is divisible by `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1(n, k)` which performs the following:
1. It calculates `multiplier = 10 ** k`. This represents the smallest number that ends with `k` zeros.
2. It computes `x` using the formula `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`.

#### Explanation of the Calculation:
- The term `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` finds the greatest common divisor between `n` and `multiplier`. 
- The division `multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)` gives the smallest integer that is a multiple of `multiplier` and also ensures that the resulting `x` is divisible by `n`.

### Verification of Requirements:
1. **Ends with k or more zeros**: Since `multiplier` is defined as `10 ** k`, any integer multiplied by `multiplier` will end with at least `k` zeros.
2. **Divisible by n**: The formula ensures that `x` is constructed in such a way that it will always be divisible by `n` by scaling `n` with a suitable multiple of `multiplier`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It effectively calculates the minimum positive integer `x` that meets both criteria specified.

Thus, the conclusion about the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
