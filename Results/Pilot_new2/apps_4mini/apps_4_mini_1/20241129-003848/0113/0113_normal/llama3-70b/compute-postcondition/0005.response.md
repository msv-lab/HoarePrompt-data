The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer not equal to 10, `n` can take values such as 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, or 11, 12, ... Therefore, the new value of `n` will be a positive integer not equal to 10 and still not divisible by `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 10 and `n` is incremented by 1; `n` must not be divisible by `x`.**
