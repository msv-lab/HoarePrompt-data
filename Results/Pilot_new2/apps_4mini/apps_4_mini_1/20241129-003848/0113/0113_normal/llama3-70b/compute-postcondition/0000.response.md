The values of `n` and `k` are assigned new values based on the input provided. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, the states of the original variables are affected and updated accordingly. The values of `n` and `k` will now reflect whatever values are input during the execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is now an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8.

Output State: **`n` is now an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is now an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8.**
