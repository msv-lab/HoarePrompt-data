The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so it will now be `i + 1`. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from the `bus_routes[i]`, where `s_i` is the start time of the bus route and `d_i` is the destination. The variable `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range, and `t` is also a positive integer, the variables `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5; `i` is now incremented by 1; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`; `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`; `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.**
