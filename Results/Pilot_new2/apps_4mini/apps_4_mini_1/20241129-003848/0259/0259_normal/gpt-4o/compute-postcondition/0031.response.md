The code calculates the `wait_time` based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i`. Here, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`, and `d_i` is the second element of that tuple. The expression `(t - s_i) % d_i` determines the wait time from the current time `t`, accounting for the start time `s_i` of the bus route and its frequency `d_i`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state must reflect the calculation of `wait_time` while preserving the information about the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is the next index which is less than `n`; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `d_i` is the second element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
