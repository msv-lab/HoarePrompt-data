To determine the output state, we first analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state. 

1. The variable `wait_time` has been computed based on the conditions given prior to the code execution. Since the code snippet assigns `min_wait_time` the value of `wait_time`, the value of `min_wait_time` is directly affected by the previously computed `wait_time`.
2. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `i`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`) remain unchanged and are still valid after the code execution.

Thus, the output will reflect these conditions by updating only `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is the next index which is less than `n`; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `d_i` is the second element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
