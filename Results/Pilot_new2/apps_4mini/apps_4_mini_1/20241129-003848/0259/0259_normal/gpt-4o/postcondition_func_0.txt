The function accepts a positive integer `n` (the number of bus routes), a positive integer `t` (the current time), and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, each containing two positive integers representing the start time and interval of the bus routes. It calculates the minimum wait time for a bus route and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time. If no suitable bus route is found (i.e., all buses start after time `t`), it returns -1.
