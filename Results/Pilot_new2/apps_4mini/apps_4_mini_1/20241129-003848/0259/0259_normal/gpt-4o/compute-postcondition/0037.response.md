Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated based on the bus routes; `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time. If no suitable route is found, `min_wait_time` remains float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1.**
