Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is the next index which is less than `n`; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `s_i` is the first element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; `d_i` is the second element of the tuple in `bus_routes` at index `i`; if `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. Otherwise, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.***
