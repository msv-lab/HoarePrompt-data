Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, `min_time` is `float('inf')`, `ans` is `-1`, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, and the current value of `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`. Additionally, the current value of `time` is less than `min_time`.***
