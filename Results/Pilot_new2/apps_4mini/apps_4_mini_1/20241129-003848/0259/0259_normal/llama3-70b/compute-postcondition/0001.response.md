The code initializes an empty list `buses`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `buses` while retaining the constraints on `n` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` is an empty list.**
