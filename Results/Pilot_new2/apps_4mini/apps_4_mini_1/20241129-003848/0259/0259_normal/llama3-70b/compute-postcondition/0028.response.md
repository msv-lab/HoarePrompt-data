The value of `ans` is updated to `i + 1`, where `i` is currently `2`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `2 + 1`, which equals `3`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, `i` is 2, `ans` is 3, `min_time` is equal to `(t - buses[i][0]) % buses[i][1]**
