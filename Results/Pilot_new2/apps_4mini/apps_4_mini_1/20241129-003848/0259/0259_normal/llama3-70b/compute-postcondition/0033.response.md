Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (representing the number of bus routes) and a positive integer `t` (representing a time). It collects `n` pairs of integers `(s, d)` representing the start time and duration of each bus route. The function calculates the minimum wait time for the next bus based on the provided times and durations, and it prints the 1-based index of the bus with the shortest wait time. If no bus results in a wait time (which is impossible given the constraints), it would print `-1`. However, since inputs are constrained, the function will always return a valid bus index. **
