The value of `n` is assigned from the input, and since `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100, it will now hold the specific integer value provided by the user input. The list `a` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`, with `n` now equal to the user-provided integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the user-provided input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`.**
