The function `func` accepts user input for an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` containing `n` distinct integers, each in the range from 1 to `n`. It finds the positions of the integers 1 and `n` within the list, calculates the maximum and minimum distances between these positions while also considering the distance to the edges of the list. Finally, it prints the maximum of these calculated values. However, it does not return any value, as the return behavior is not explicitly defined in the provided context. The function relies on user input and does not handle any input errors or edge cases, such as incorrect integer ranges or duplicate values in the list. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n`, and prints the result without returning any value. **
