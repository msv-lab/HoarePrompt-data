To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements step by step.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. Nicholas has a permutation of size `n` consisting of distinct integers from `1` to `n`.
2. The task is to perform exactly one swap to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n).
3. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
The function reads the input values for `n` and the permutation `a`. It then finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array.

1. **Finding Positions:**
   - `pos1 = a.index(1)` gives the position of the minimum element (1).
   - `posn = a.index(n)` gives the position of the maximum element (n).

2. **Calculating Maximum Distance:**
   - The program calculates `max_dist` and `min_dist` using the formula:
     ```python
     max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
     min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
     ```
   - This calculation is flawed. The expression `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` does not correctly represent the distance after one swap; instead, it computes the current distance minus one, which does not reflect the possible new positions after a swap.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The line `print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))` is also misleading. The value of `max_dist` does not correctly account for the best swap to maximize the distance between positions of 1 and n.

### Key Issues:
- The logic to calculate the distances does not consider all possible swaps to determine the maximum possible distance.
- The use of `max()` and `min()` in the distance calculation does not fulfill the requirement of performing an exact swap that maximizes the distance.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1:**
  Input: `5`, `4 5 1 3 2`
  - Current positions: 1 at index 2, 5 at index 1. 
  - The distance is 1.
  - After swapping 1 and 2, we can achieve a distance of 3. The program may not reach this conclusion correctly.

- **Case 2:**
  Input: `7`, `1 6 5 3 4 7 2`
  - The current distance is 5 and can be maximized by swapping 7 with 2, which leads to a distance of 6. The program does not accurately compute this.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the maximum possible distance after one swap according to the problem description. It fails to properly account for the best swap and employs incorrect calculations for the distances.

**Correctness: False**
