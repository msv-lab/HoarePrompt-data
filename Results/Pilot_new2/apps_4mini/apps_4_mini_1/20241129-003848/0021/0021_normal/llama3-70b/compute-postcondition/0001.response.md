The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list that is created by mapping `int` over the input split into distinct integers. The input consists of `n` integers based on user input, and since `n` is between 2 and 100, `a` will hold `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to the user-provided input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is the user input and in the range from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the user-provided input such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers input by the user in the range from 1 to `n`.**
