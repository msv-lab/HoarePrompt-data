The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is composed of `n` distinct integers and given that `1` is assumed to be present in the list, the value of `min_pos` will be the index of `1` in that list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`.**
