The code snippet `print(max_distance)` outputs the value of the variable `max_distance`. Since there are no modifications made to the variables prior to this print statement, the values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(max_pos`); `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`; `max_distance` is equal to `max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)`; `max_distance` has been printed.**
