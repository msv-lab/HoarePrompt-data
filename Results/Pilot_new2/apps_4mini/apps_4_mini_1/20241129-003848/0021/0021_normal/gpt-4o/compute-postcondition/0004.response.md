The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `0` and `max_pos`. The variable `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the value of `max_pos` could be any valid index depending on the arrangement of elements in `a` but must be a valid index corresponding to the first occurrence of `n`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(max_pos)`**.
