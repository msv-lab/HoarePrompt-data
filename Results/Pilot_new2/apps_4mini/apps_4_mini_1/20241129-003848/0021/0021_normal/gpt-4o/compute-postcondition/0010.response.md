The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers, where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, representing a permutation of size `n`. After executing the function, it processes the values provided in `n` and `a`, potentially returning a specified output based on the logic defined within. 

However, the specific output behavior is not detailed in your requirements. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of size `n`, where `n` is between 2 and 100, and each integer in `a` is between 1 and `n` inclusive.**
