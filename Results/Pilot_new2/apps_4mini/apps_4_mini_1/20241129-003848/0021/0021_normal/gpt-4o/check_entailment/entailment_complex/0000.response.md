Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. 

Here are the reasons for the failure:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Distance**: The program calculates the distance of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements from the two ends of the list (position 0 and position n-1). However, the problem requires the program to calculate the distance between the positions of the minimum and maximum elements after making a single swap. The original program only checks the distances from the ends of the list and does not consider the effect of performing a swap to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements.

2. **Inability to Perform a Valid Swap**: The problem explicitly states that exactly one swap should be done to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. The program simply prints the maximum distance from the edges without actually performing any swap and without considering what elements could be swapped to achieve the maximum distance.

3. **Example Cases**: For the example input `5` with the array `4 5 1 3 2`, the expected output is `3`. The correct approach would involve finding that swapping `1` (index 2) with `2` (index 4) would yield the maximum distance of `3` (between positions 4 and 2). The current implementation does not consider this and does not perform any swap.

In summary, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements because it focuses on distances from the edges rather than calculating the maximum distance achievable through one swap between the minimum and maximum elements.
