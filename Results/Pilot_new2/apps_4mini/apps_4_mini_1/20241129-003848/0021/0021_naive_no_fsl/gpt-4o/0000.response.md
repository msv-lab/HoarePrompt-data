To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze how it attempts to solve the problem and check if it can handle all edge cases as described.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We are given a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n.
2. Our goal is to maximize the distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements by performing exactly one swap.

### Analyzing the Code:
The provided code reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It identifies the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) values in the list. Then it calculates the possible distances by considering swapping either the minimum or maximum element with the edges of the list (first index and last index).

The distances are calculated as follows:
- `dist1`: distance if the maximum is swapped with the first element.
- `dist2`: distance if the maximum is swapped with the last element.
- `dist3`: distance if the minimum is swapped with the first element.
- `dist4`: distance if the minimum is swapped with the last element.

Finally, it prints the maximum of these four distances.

### Identifying Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum and Maximum Already in Place**: If the input is such that 1 is at index 0 and n is at index n-1, the maximum distance is already achieved. The code does not need to perform any unnecessary swaps, but it suggests that the maximum distance might still be achievable by swapping elements that are not the min/max. The code might print a distance that does not take this into account.

2. **Consecutive Elements**: If 1 and n are next to each other, the program does not handle this well since it calculates swaps with the edges but should ideally consider their positions relative to each other.

3. **Swapping Non-Optimal Elements**: The logic could potentially lead to a scenario where the maximum distance is not achieved if the minimum/maximum are swapped with elements that do not maximize the distance.

### Example Test Case:
Consider the permutation `3, 1, 2` (n=3):
- Current positions: `1` at index 1 and `3` at index 0.
- Possible swaps:
  - Swap `1` with `3`: new array `1, 3, 2`, distance = 2 (min at 0, max at 1) - Not optimal.
  - Swap `1` with `2`: new array `3, 2, 1`, distance = 2 (min at 2, max at 0) - Not optimal.
  
Expected maximum distance: 2, but the code checks only for swapping with edges, which does not optimally address this scenario.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle all potential cases correctly. It misses that sometimes the best swap might not involve the edges but rather the elements closest to min and max. Hence, the correctness of the program can be determined as follows:

Correctness: **False**
