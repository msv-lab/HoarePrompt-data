Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input in a way that can handle very large integers (up to 10^6 digits) by using `input().split()` to read the whole line at once, which is appropriate for large inputs.

2. **Leading Zero Removal**: The program successfully removes leading zeros from both `a` and `b` using `lstrip('0')`. This ensures that the integers are compared in their appropriate forms.

3. **Handling Empty Strings**: After removing leading zeros, if `a` or `b` becomes an empty string, the program assigns them a value of '0'. This is crucial because the problem states that both inputs should be treated as non-negative integers, and an empty string should be interpreted as zero.

4. **Comparison Logic**: The program correctly implements the comparison logic:
   - It first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. If `len(a) < len(b)`, it prints '<', and if `len(a) > len(b)`, it prints '>'.
   - If the lengths are equal, it then compares the values of `a` and `b` directly to determine if one is less than, greater than, or equal to the other.

5. **Output**: The output is correctly formatted according to the problem requirements, printing '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison results.

Overall, the program handles all requirements specified in the problem description and correctly compares the two very long integers represented as strings, making it a valid implementation.
