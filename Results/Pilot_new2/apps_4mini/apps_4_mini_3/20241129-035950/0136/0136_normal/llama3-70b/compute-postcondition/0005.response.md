Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, which may be empty if the input was all zeros, `a` is not equal to `b`, and the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`.***
