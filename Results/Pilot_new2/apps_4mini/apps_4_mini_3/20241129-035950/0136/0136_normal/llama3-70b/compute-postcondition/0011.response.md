The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have at most 10^6 characters. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two strings `a` and `b` representing non-negative integers, which may have leading zeroes. The function processes these strings and returns a result based on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers represented as strings, and may return a result based on those values.**
