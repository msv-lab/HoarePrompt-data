The provided program reads two integers, `x` and `y`, representing the initial and target side lengths of an equilateral triangle, respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints that value.

However, the problem description requires the program to determine the minimum number of operations needed to change the triangle from side length `x` to side length `y`, ensuring that the triangle remains a non-degenerate triangle throughout the process.

The program takes the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` as the number of seconds required, which is incorrect for several reasons:

1. The program does not consider the need to maintain a non-degenerate triangle during the transition. Specifically, it should ensure that at all times, the sides of the triangle remain positive integers and adhere to the triangle inequality.

2. The operation needs to account for the fact that all three sides of the triangle need to be modified, and the approach should consider the minimum number of modifications necessary to achieve the target side length.

For example, if `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the correct sequence of operations (as described in the problem) would involve multiple steps, including reducing the side lengths of the triangle strategically, which the program does not capture.

### Test Case:
- Input: `x = 6`, `y = 3`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Program Output: `3` (since `abs(6 - 3) = 3`)

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem description's requirements as it oversimplifies the transition process.

Correctness: **False**.
