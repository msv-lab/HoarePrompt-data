`x` and `y` are assigned the values of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input` accepts two space-separated integers, and `int` converts them to integers. The previous constraints of the variables state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, but the exact values of `x` and `y` after this assignment are unknown as they depend on the user input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `x` and `y` as unspecified integers within the given constraints.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, with values assigned from user input.**
