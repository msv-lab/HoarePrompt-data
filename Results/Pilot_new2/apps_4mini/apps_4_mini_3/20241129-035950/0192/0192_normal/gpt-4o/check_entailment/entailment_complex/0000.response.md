To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the code.

### Problem Requirements Recap
The problem states that Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x`, and he wants to transform it into another equilateral triangle of side length `y`. The transformation can only be done by changing the sides of the triangle in integer lengths while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate (has a positive area). The goal is to compute the minimum number of modifications required to achieve this.

### Annotated Program Breakdown
The function `func` reads two integers `x` and `y` from input. It then calculates the result using the expression:
```python
(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2
```
This expression effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference `(x - y)`. Let's break it down:

1. **Difference Calculation**: `x - y` gives the total length that needs to be reduced in total from the three sides of the triangle.
   
2. **Dividing by 2**: Since we can change only one side at a time, dividing the total difference by `2` gives us a base number of changes needed.

3. **Handling Odd Numbers**: The addition of `(x - y) % 2` accounts for cases where the difference is odd, meaning an extra modification would be necessary to achieve the final equality.

### Analysis of the Approach
- The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` simplifies to `(x - y + 1) // 2`, which calculates the ceiling of `(x - y) / 2` correctly.
- Each modification can indeed change one side of the triangle. The final calculation correctly accounts for all necessary modifications to turn the sides into the desired length `y`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of modifications needed to change an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to side length `y`, satisfying all the conditions of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
