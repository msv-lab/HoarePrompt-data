The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the values inputted by the user. The initial constraints are that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, which will still hold after the execution as the `map(int, input().split())` will assign new integer values to `x` and `y`. The previous conditions regarding `x` and `y` remain valid, but their specific values will change based on user input.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, where `x` and `y` are updated to the user-provided integers.**
