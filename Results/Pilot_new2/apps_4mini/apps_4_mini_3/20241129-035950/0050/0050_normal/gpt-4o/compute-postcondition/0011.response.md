Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` positive integers parsed from input, `b` is a list of `m` integers parsed from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is equal to `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, and the value of `total_bourles` is printed.**
