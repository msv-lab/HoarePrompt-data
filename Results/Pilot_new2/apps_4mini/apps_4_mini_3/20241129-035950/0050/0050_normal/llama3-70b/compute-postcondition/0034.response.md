The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` must be greater than 1, `shares` is 0, `r` remains as the remaining amount after distributing shares according to the integers in `s`, `s` contains at least `n` elements, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
