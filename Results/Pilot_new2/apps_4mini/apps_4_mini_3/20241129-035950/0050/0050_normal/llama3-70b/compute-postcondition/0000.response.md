In the given code snippet, the variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values from the input, which are expected to be three integers. The previous conditions indicate that `n` and `m` are integers in the range from 1 to 30, and `r` is an integer in the range from 1 to 1000. 

After the execution of the code, `n`, `m`, and `r` will hold the values provided by the user input. However, since these input values are unspecified, we can only describe them abstractly rather than assigning specific values.

The output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `r` have now been assigned values based on user input while keeping the conditions intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000)**
