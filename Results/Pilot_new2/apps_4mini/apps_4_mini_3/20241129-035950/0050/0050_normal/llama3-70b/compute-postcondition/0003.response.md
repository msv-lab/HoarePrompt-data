The command `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in place, meaning that the order of the elements in `s` will change, but the specific integers contained within the list do not change. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged, while `s` will now be in ascending order. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers generated from input.**
