Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 30. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, then `r` is updated to `r % s[0]`, `shares` is calculated as `0 + (r // s[0])`, and `i` remains 0. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then the state remains with `n`, `m`, and `shares` unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.***
