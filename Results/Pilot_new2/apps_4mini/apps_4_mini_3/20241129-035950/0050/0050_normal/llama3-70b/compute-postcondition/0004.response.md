`b` is sorted in reverse order, meaning the elements of the list `b` are rearranged from largest to smallest. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `b` is now sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.**
