Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic needed to maximize the bourles after trading. It first determines the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it determines that no profitable trade can occur, and thus returns the initial amount of bourles. 

In cases where buying and selling could yield profit, it calculates the number of shares that can be bought with the available bourles and subsequently computes the total bourles after selling those shares at the maximum price.

I cannot identify a potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements described in the problem statement. All conditions and possible scenarios appear to be accounted for correctly.
