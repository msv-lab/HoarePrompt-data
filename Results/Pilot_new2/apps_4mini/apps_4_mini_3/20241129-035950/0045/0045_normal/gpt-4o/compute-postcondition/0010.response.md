Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, a sequence `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]` is established based on `d` which is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
