The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the condition is not met. If the loop executes fully, the function returns a sequence containing the original values incremented appropriately based on the number of times the loop executed, with the remainder being 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return -1 if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, or return a sequence of incremented values if the loop executes successfully. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, returns -1 if min_sum is greater than n, otherwise returns a sequence of incremented values based on the loop execution.**
