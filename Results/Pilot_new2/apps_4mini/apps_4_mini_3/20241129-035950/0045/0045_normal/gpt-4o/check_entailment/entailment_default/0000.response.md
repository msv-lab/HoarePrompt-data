To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the evaluation into parts.

### Initial Assessment of the Code
The code defines a function `func_1(n, k)` which attempts to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have a maximal greatest common divisor (GCD). The function calculates the minimum sum required to form such a sequence (`min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`). If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, the function correctly returns `-1` as there is no possible sequence.

If the minimum sum does not exceed `n`, the code proceeds to find the maximal GCD by calculating how many times this minimum sum can fit into `n` (`d = n // min_sum`) and then constructs a base sequence multiplied by `d`. 

It then distributes the remaining value to the last elements of the sequence to ensure the final sequence remains strictly increasing.

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. **Minimum Valid Input**: For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be `1` because it meets the requirements.
2. **Impossible Case**: If `n < min_sum` which occurs when `k > n`, the code correctly returns `-1`.
3. **Maximal GCD**: If `n` can be expressed as `k` positive integers that are all equal (like `2, 2` for `n = 4` and `k = 2`), the code should yield the correct sequence while maintaining the strictly increasing condition.
4. **Remainders**: The distribution of the remainder needs to ensure that the sequence remains strictly increasing. If the sequence ends up being non-increasing due to improper handling of the remainder, it would violate the requirements.

### Output Hints Evaluation
The output hints explain that the function calculates a minimum sum and attempts to distribute the remaining value to form a valid sequence. They suggest the function returns a sequence or `-1`, which align with the code's behavior.

However, upon reviewing both the code and the hints, the potential issue arises from how the remainder is handled. If we take a case like `n = 8` and `k = 2`, the expected output could be `2 6`, which is valid. But if we consider `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the sequence created might not respect the strictly increasing requirement if the logic does not properly account for the adjusted increases.

### Conclusion
After reviewing both the code and the output hints, I can conclude that there are edge cases, particularly around the distribution of remainders that could yield sequences that do not maintain the strictly increasing condition. For example, if `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the function might generate a sequence like `1, 3, 5`, which is valid, but if the logic fails to distribute correctly, it could also produce `2, 2, 5`, which is incorrect due to not being strictly increasing.

Thus, based on the potential failure to maintain the strictly increasing requirement in various edge cases while handling the remainder, the overall correctness of the provided program can be deemed:

Correctness: **False**.
