The program is designed to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum equals `n`, while also maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). 

Let's analyze the code and the provided problem description:

1. **Initial Conditions Check**: The code checks if `n < k`. If true, it outputs `-1`, which is correct since you cannot form a sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` if `n` is less than `k`.

2. **Sequence Generation**: The code then constructs a sequence by attempting to append the integers from `1` to `k` to the sequence. It deducts these integers from `n` as they are added to the sequence. The loop continues until `n` can no longer accommodate the next integer or until all `k` integers have been added.

3. **Final Checks**: After attempting to construct the sequence, if the length of the sequence is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the sequence.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- The case where `n` is exactly equal to the sum of the first `k` integers, which is `k * (k + 1) / 2`. If `n` is less than this sum but greater than or equal to `k`, the program will output a sequence with a length of `k`, but the sum will not equal `n`.
- The code doesn't address the requirement to maximize the GCD of the sequence. The sequence it currently generates (`1, 2, ..., k`) has a GCD of `1`, which may not be optimal. For example:
  - For `n = 8` and `k = 2`, the output should ideally be `2, 6`, which has a GCD of `2`, instead of just 1.
  
Given these points, the code does not fulfill the requirement of maximizing the GCD of the sequence generated.

The output hints provide information about the GCD calculation but do not directly validate the correctness of the sequence generation as per the problem's constraints.

**Conclusion**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly and does not maximize the GCD of the sequence as required by the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**. 

An example where the program fails is when `n = 8` and `k = 2`. The expected output is `2 6`, but the program may output `1 2` which does not satisfy the condition.
