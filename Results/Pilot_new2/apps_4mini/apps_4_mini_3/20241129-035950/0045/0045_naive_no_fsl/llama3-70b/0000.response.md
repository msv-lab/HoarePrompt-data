To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code and verify if it meets all requirements.

The problem specifies that we need to create a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers that sum up to n and have a maximal greatest common divisor (GCD). If such a sequence does not exist, the program should return -1.

Now, let's evaluate the code step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`.

2. **Check for Minimum Sum**:
   The condition `if n < k:` checks if `n` is less than `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it is impossible to create k distinct positive integers that sum to n, so the program correctly returns -1.

3. **Building the Sequence**:
   The program initializes an empty list `seq` and attempts to construct the sequence by iterating from 1 to k. It adds the integers from 1 to k to `seq` as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the current integer being added. After adding an integer, it subtracts that integer from `n`. If it successfully adds k integers, it prints the sequence.

4. **Checking Length of Sequence**:
   If the length of the sequence is not equal to k after the loop, the program returns -1, which means it couldn't form a complete sequence of k integers.

5. **Output**:
   If the sequence of k integers is successfully constructed, it outputs the sequence.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not check for the GCD of the sequence created; it simply returns the first k integers starting from 1. This does not guarantee that the GCD is maximized.
- For example, if `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the program will output `1 2 3` which sums to 6, but the maximal GCD could be achieved with `2 4 6`, which sums to 12 and has a GCD of 2.

### Test Case:
Consider the input:
```
n = 12
k = 3
```
The expected output with maximal GCD would be `2 4 6`, but the program would instead output `1 2 3`, which does not satisfy the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly adhere to the problem description as it does not ensure the GCD of the generated sequence is maximal. Thus, the sequence might not be valid for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
