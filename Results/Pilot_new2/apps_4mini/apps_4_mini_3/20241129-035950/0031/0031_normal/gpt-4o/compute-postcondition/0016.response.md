The `denominator` is updated to the value of `denominator * total_days % MOD`. The `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), and `MOD` is 1000003. Other variables are not affected. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `denominator` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `k` is less than or equal to 1 << n, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is equal to 2^n, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^n - 2) % 1000003`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is 2**
