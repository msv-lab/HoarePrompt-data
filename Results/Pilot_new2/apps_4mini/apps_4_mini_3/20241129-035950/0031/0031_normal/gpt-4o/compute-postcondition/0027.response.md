The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the function does not return any value, resulting in a return of None. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, without providing any output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers, and returns None.**
