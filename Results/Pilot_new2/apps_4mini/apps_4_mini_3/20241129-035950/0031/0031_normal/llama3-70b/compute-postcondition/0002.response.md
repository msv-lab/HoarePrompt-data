The value of `denominator` is assigned to `1`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `total_days`, and `numerator` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `denominator` as well as the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to `2`, `numerator` is equal to `1`, `denominator` is equal to `1`.**
