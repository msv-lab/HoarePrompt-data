Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It calculates `total_days` as `2 ** n`, and depending on the value of `k`, it computes a `numerator` and `denominator`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 3, the function returns `(0, 1)`. If `k` equals 2, it returns `(1, 2)`. The functionality does not handle cases where `k` is less than 2, as the constraints ensure that this situation will not occur. Additionally, given the large potential values for `n` and `k`, it does not check for overflow in the calculations.**
