The `max_divisor` variable is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the current value of `i`. The value of `i` is defined as the next integer in the range, so its value will be greater than the previous value of `i`. The variable `max_divisor` will either remain unchanged if it is greater than or equal to `i`, or it will be updated to the value of `i` if `i` is greater than the current `max_divisor`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `i`, `i` is the next integer in the range (i + 1)**.
