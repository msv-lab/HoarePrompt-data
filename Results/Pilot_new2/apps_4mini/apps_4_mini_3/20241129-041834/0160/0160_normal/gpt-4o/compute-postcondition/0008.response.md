The value of `x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N, and since `i` is 2, we calculate `x // i`, which gives us `N // 2`. The value of `divisors` is updated to include `N // 2`. Since `N` is at least 4, `N // 2` will be at least 2. Therefore, `divisors` will now contain the values 1, N, 2, and now N // 2.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (4 <= N <= 500); `i` is 2; `divisors` is now a set containing the values 1, N, 2, and N // 2.**
