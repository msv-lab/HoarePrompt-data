The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. Given that `i` is 1, it will be added to the empty set. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), `i` is 1, `divisors` is now a set containing the value 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), `i` is 1, `divisors` is a set containing the value 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**
