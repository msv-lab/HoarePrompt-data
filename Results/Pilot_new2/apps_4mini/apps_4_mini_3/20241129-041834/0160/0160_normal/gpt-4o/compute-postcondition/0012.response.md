The value of `x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (4 <= N <= 500), and `i` is 3. The expression `x // i` performs an integer division of the first element of `x` (which is N) by `i`. Therefore, the value being added to the `divisors` set is `N // 3`. Since `divisors` already includes 3, after the execution of `divisors.add(x // i)`, `divisors` will now also include `N // 3`, which is an integer value depending on N.

The states of the other variables are not affected, and the contents of `divisors` are updated to include the new calculated value.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (4 <= N <= 500), `i` is 3, `divisors` includes 3 and N // 3.**
