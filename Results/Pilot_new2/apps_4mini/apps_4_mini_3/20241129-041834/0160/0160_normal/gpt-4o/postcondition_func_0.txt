The function accepts a list `lst` containing at least two integers, where the first integer is used as the initial value for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) with every subsequent integer in the list. It returns the GCD of all integers in `lst`, starting from the second integer onward. If `lst` contains only two integers, it will return the GCD of those two numbers. The function does not handle cases where the input list might not meet the constraints, such as being too short, but based on the provided constraints, it is expected to work correctly.
