The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer, constrained such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). After executing the function body, the program returns `x`, which is calculated as \(n\) multiplied by \(\frac{10}{\text{gcd}(n, 10)}\), where \(\text{gcd}\) is the greatest common divisor. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return the product of `n` and \(10\) divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and \(10\). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer) and k (a non-negative integer), and returns n multiplied by (10 divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10).**
