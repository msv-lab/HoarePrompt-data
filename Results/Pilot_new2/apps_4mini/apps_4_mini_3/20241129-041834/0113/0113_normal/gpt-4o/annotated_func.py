#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns x which is equal to n multiplied by (10 divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns the product of `n` and the quotient of `10` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `10`. This effectively scales `n` by a factor that adjusts for any common factors with `10`, which is useful for ensuring that the result is a multiple of `10` based on the value of `k`. The function does not handle cases where `k` is outside the specified range, but it does assume valid input as stated in the preconditions.
