The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the `buses` list. The initial state indicates that `n` must be at least 2 and `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000. The tuple `(s, d)` is a pair of input integers that will be added to the `buses` list. Therefore, the `buses` list will now include an additional entry of `(s, d)`.

The states of the other variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` now includes the tuple `(s, d)`**.
