According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 2, which means it could be 2 or more. Since the loop has executed once, it will be executed again only if `n` is still at least 2 after the last iteration. The loop variable `_` does not hold any value that needs to be considered beyond indicating the loop has iterated.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be at least 2, and since the loop will decrement `n` by 1 after this iteration, it will subsequently be 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` now includes the tuple `(s, d)`**
