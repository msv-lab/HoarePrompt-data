According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times and the loop variable is denoted by an underscore (`_`), meaning we are not using it inside the loop body. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 1, indicating that we can execute the loop again only if `n` is increased to at least 2. The other variables (`t`, `buses`, `s`, `d`) do not affect the loop's execution count.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.**
