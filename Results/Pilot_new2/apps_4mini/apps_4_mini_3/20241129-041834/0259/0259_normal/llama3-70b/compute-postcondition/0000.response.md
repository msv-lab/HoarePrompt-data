The values of `n` and `t` are assigned based on input values, which are both integers. The constraints state that `n` must be between 1 and 100, and `t` must be between 1 and 100000. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, and both are assigned from input values.**
