To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, I will analyze the initial conditions and see how they relate to the given code.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) 
- `i` is 2 
- `s_i` is the third element of `bus_routes[2]` 
- `d_i` is the fourth element of `bus_routes[2]` 
- `wait_time` is calculated based on conditions involving `s_i` and `t`

The code snippet:
```
min_wait_time = wait_time
```

The code assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` has been previously determined based on the conditions outlined in the initial state. The other variables `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state will include all the information about the precondition and update the value of `min_wait_time` to be equal to `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100); `i` is 2; `s_i` is the third element of `bus_routes[2]`; `d_i` is the fourth element of `bus_routes[2]`; `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
