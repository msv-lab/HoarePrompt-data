To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze the logic of the code step by step and compare it with the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Serval arrives at the bus station at time `t`.
2. There are `n` bus routes, each defined by their first bus arrival time `s_i` and the time interval `d_i` for subsequent buses.
3. The task is to identify which bus route he will take based on the earliest bus that arrives after or at time `t`.
4. If multiple buses arrive at the same earliest time, any of those routes is acceptable.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`.
2. It initializes `min_wait_time` to infinity and `chosen_route` to -1.
3. It iterates over each bus route:
   - If the first bus arrives after `t` (`s_i >= t`), it calculates the wait time as `s_i - t`.
   - If a bus arrives exactly at `t` (`(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), it sets the wait time to 0.
   - If the first bus arrives before `t`, it calculates the next bus arrival using the formula: `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which determines the time until the next bus.
4. It compares the calculated wait time with `min_wait_time` and updates `chosen_route` if the current wait time is less.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Handling of Arrival Times**: The program correctly identifies the first possible bus that Serval can take. It considers cases where the first bus arrives after `t`, exactly at `t`, and before `t`, correctly calculating wait times in each scenario.
- **Selection Logic**: The comparison for selecting the bus route (`if wait_time < min_wait_time`) ensures that the first bus arriving (after or at `t`) with the least wait time is chosen, which aligns with the problem description.
- **Return Value**: The program returns the index of the chosen route as a 1-indexed value, which is what the problem description requires.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. It accounts for all possible cases regarding bus arrival times and ensures that the earliest bus route is selected based on calculated wait times.

Correctness: **True**
