Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) representing the time the first bus of the i-th route arrives (1 <= s_i <= 100000) and the interval between two buses of this route (1 <= d_i <= 100000); `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity (float('inf')), `chosen_route` is set to -1.**
