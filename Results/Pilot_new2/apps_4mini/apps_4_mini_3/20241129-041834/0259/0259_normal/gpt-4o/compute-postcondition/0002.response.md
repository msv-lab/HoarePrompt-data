According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which represents the number of bus routes. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, the index `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. 

For the loop to execute correctly, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and can iterate up to `n - 1`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted before the loop starts are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 0**
