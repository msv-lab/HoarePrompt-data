The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is initially 1, the value of `chosen_route` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is calculated based on the condition of `s_i` and `t`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is calculated based on the condition of `s_i` and `t`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is equal to 2.**
