The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. Since `wait_time` is calculated based on given conditions, the other variables are not impacted by this assignment. The initial state remains valid, but now `wait_time` is specifically set to `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is 0.**
