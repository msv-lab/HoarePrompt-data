#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100), t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station (1 <= t <= 100000), and bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) representing the time the first bus of the i-th route arrives (1 <= s_i <= 100000) and the interval between two buses of this route (1 <= d_i <= 100000).
def func_1(n, t, bus_routes):
    min_wait_time = float('inf')
    chosen_route = -1
    for i in range(n):
        s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]
        
        if s_i >= t:
            wait_time = s_i - t
        elif (t - s_i) % d_i == 0:
            wait_time = 0
        else:
            wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
        
        if wait_time < min_wait_time:
            min_wait_time = wait_time
            chosen_route = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time for all bus routes based on their schedules and the time `t`, `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route (1-indexed) with the minimum wait time. If no bus routes are provided, then `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity (float('inf')) and `chosen_route` remains -1.
    return chosen_route
    #The program returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, which is 'chosen_route'. If no bus routes are provided, 'chosen_route' is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` representing the time Serval arrives at the station, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, where each tuple contains two positive integers that define the arrival time and interval of each bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for all the bus routes based on their schedules and returns the index of the route with the smallest wait time. If `n` is 0 (though the provided constraints indicate `1 <= n`), it would return -1 since there are no bus routes to consider. The function does not explicitly handle the situation where `bus_routes` is empty, which could lead to an unexpected behavior if `n` is valid but the list is empty. Thus, the expected outcome is that it returns the 1-indexed bus route with the shortest wait, or -1 if no valid bus routes exist.
