The code calculates the `wait_time` based on the given formula. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[1]`, and `t` is some time value that affects the calculation.

The formula used is:
```
wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
```

This means `wait_time` is assigned the value resulting from the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The specific calculation will depend on the actual values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. However, since we don't have specific values for `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, the output will reflect that `wait_time` has been updated based on the formula.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
