To calculate `max_dist`, we start with the formula `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. Here, we need to compute two values: 

1. `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`: This gives us the absolute distance between `pos1` and `posn`, reduced by 1.
2. `n - 2`: This simply takes the integer `n` and subtracts 2 from it.

The `max` function will take the larger of these two calculated values. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`
- `a` is a list of integers from input
- `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`
- `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`

After executing the code, the value of `max_dist` will be updated based on the calculations above.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
