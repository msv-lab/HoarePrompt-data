To analyze the provided code snippet's impact on the initial state, we note the following:

- The values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` are derived from the positions of `1` and `n` in the list `a`.
- The expression `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)` computes a value based on `max_dist` and `min_dist` alongside `n`.

Given that `max_dist` is defined as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, and `min_dist` is defined as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, we can derive a value for the expression being printed.

However, we cannot determine exact numeric values without specific input for `a`, `pos1`, and `posn`. Therefore, we will describe the output state using the available expressions for `max_dist` and `min_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); printed value is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist).**
