The variable `dist3` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - min_pos)`. The value of `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`, which is known to be within the range of the indices of the list. The other variables remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dist3` based on the value of `min_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n]; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`**.
