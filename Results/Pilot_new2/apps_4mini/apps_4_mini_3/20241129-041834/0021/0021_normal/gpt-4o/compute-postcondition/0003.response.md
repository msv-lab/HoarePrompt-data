The code assigns `max_pos` the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer in the range from 2 to 100 and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers that includes the integer `n`, `max_pos` will take a specific index based on the position of `n` in `a`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n]; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`.**
