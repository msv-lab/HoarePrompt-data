The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by taking input and converting it into integers. The input consists of `n` distinct integers, which are within the range [1, n]. The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now a list of integers that meets the above conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] based on the input.**
