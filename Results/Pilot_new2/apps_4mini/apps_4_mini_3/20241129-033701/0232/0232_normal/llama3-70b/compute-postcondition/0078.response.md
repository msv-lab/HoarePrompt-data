Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 3; `i` is 1; `j` is 3; `found` is True; `color` is equal to `colors[3]`; and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 if `color` is not present in `window_counts`. If all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
