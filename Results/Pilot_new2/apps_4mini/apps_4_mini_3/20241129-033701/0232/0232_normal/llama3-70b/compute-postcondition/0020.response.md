The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
