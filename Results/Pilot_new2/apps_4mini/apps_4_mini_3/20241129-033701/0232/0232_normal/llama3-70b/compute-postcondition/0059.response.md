Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `window_counts[color]` is 1; `found` remains True; `color` is equal to `colors[1]`. The values of `window_counts` sorted and `counts` match, indicating that for all count and target pairs derived from `window_counts` and `counts`, the count equals the target.***
