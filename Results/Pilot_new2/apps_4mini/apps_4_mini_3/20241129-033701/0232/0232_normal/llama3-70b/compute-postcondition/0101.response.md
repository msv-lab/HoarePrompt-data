The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `color` is `colors[3]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
