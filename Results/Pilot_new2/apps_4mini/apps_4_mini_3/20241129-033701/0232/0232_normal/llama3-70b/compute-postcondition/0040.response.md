`color` is assigned the value `colors[j]`, where `j` is 2. The value of `color` changes to the element at index 2 of the `colors` list. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `color` is equal to `colors[2]`; `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or the previous value of `window_counts[color]` plus 1; and `found` remains True.**
