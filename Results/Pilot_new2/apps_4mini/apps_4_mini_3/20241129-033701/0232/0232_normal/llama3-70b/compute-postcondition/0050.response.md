Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, `window_counts` contains the counts of each unique color encountered in the `colors` list from index `i` to `n-1`, and `found` is True, indicating that the counts in `window_counts` match the sorted `counts`, which results in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
