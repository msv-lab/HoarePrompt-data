Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of integers that contains at least 1 element; `counts` is a list of integers derived from input values; if `color` is not in `color_counts`, then `color_counts` will contain the key `color` with a value of `0`.***
