Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `window_counts[color]` is 1; `found` is True; `color` is equal to `colors[1]`. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match with `counts`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
