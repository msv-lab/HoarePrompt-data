The statement `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the count of `color` in the `window_counts` dictionary by 1. Given the initial state, if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it starts with a value of 0. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `window_counts[color]` will equal 1 if it was initially 0, or it will be equal to its previous value plus 1 if it was already present in the dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, and `color` is equal to `colors[0]`.**
