The value of `found` is assigned the boolean value `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the value of `found`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `found` is True; `color` is equal to `colors[2]`; `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
