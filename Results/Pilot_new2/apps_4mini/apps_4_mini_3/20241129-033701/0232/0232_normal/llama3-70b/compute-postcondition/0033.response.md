The variable `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. Since `window_counts[color]` has previously been incremented by 1, it must have had a value of at least 1 prior to this assignment. After the assignment, `window_counts[color]` becomes `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `window_counts[color]` is 0, `j` is 1, `color` is equal to `colors[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `window_counts[color]` is 0, `j` is 1, `color` is equal to `colors[1]**
