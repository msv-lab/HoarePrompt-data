The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous details indicate that `current_counts[colors[left]]` has been decremented by 1, and we are checking if all `current_counts[color]` match the `desired_counts[color]` for each color in `desired_counts`. The variable `right` remains unchanged at 0, and `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 100. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0, `left` is incremented by 1, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` has been decremented by 1.**
