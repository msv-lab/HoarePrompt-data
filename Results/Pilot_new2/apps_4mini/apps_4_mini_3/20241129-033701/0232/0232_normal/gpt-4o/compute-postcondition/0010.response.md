Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0, `current_counts[colors[0]]` is incremented by 1, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1, for each `color` in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]`, but it is not the case that all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]`, `left` is incremented by 1.**
