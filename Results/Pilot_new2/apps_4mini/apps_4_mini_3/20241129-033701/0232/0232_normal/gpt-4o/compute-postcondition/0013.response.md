Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0, `current_counts[colors[0]]` is incremented by 1, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1. If all `current_counts[color]` match the `desired_counts[color]` for each color in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions for maintaining the desired counts are valid after these adjustments.***
