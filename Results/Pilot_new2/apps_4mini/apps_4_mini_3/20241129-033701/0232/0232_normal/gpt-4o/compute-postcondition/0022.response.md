According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `right` and the integer `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is 0, and since the loop must have executed until at least one `current_counts[color]` became less than `desired_counts[color]`, it indicates that the loop executed at least once. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), for the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be incremented. Therefore, after the last iteration, `right` should be 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than 1, `right` is 1, `left` is the original value of `left` plus the total number of times the loop executed, and `current_counts[color]` for each `color` in `desired_counts` is equal to `desired_counts[color]`.**
