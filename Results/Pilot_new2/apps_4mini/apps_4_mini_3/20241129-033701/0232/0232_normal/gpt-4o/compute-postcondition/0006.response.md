Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0, `current_counts[colors[0]]` has been incremented by 1, for each `color` in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]`, and all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]` for every `color` in `desired_counts`.***
