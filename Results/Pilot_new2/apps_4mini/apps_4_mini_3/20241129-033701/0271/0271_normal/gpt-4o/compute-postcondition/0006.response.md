Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, `result` is equal to `n - (n % 10)`, which rounds `n` down to the nearest ten. If the remainder is greater than 5, `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`, which rounds `n` up to the nearest ten.***
