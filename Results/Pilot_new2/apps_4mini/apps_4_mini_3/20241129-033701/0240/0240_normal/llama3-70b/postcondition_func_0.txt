The function accepts a non-empty string `s` containing digits and a non-empty substring `t` that may contain leading zeros. It constructs a new string by concatenating all characters from `s` that are also present in `t`, followed by the substring `t`, and returns the integer value of this concatenated string. If `s` has no characters that match those in `t`, the result will still include `t`, which could lead to returning an integer that represents just `t` (not prefixed by any characters from `s`).
