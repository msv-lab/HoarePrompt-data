The variable `n` is updated by adding `c` to its previous value. The value of `c` is the second character of the string `s`, which contains digits. This means `c` is a digit character. The impact of this code is that `n` now reflects the addition of a digit character to its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string containing digits, `c` is the second character of `s`, `n` is updated to its previous value plus `c` (where `c` is a digit character).

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing digits, `c` is the second character of `s`, `n` is updated to its previous value plus `c`.**
