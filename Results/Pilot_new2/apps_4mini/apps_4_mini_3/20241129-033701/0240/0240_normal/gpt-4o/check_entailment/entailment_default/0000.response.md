To assess the correctness of the given Python program, we will analyze the problem description, the implementation of the functions, and the corresponding output descriptions for each function.

### Problem Description
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a shuffled string of digits that includes a substring `sub` and the length of `n`.

### Functions Overview
1. **Function `func_1(s, sub)`**
   - This function calculates the number of digits in `n` by finding the length of the string `s` minus the length of `sub`.
   - It uses `Counter` to get the frequency of each digit in `s` and `sub`, then constructs `remaining_chars` from the digits still available after accounting for `sub`.
   - It generates possible numbers using a helper function and returns the smallest one.

2. **Function `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)`**
   - This function checks if `sub` exists in `num_str` and verifies that `num_str` has the correct length.
   - However, it does not check against any defined `n_len` which means it cannot correctly validate the length of the reconstructed number `n`.

3. **Function `generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub)`**
   - This function generates permutations of the characters and yields candidates that match the validity condition set by the `is_valid_number` function.
   - It does not return a list but a generator, which is useful for memory efficiency but could lead to performance issues with a very large set of permutations.

### Output Descriptions
- The output descriptions of the functions describe what the functions are doing and highlight some limitations.
- Particularly, they mention that `func_1` does not handle cases where `possible_numbers` is empty, and `is_valid_number` does not check the length of `num_str` against any defined length.

### Analysis of Potential Edge Cases
1. **Potential for Empty Permutations**: If after generating `remaining_chars`, there are no characters left to form valid permutations with `sub`, the program may fail silently since it doesn't handle empty `possible_numbers`.

2. **Length Check**: `is_valid_number` should check both the presence of `sub` and the length of `num_str` to match `n_len`. This could lead to cases where a generated candidate might not satisfy the length condition, resulting in incorrect outputs.

3. **Leading Zeros**: Given that `n` should not have leading zeros (except for the number `0`), the program should ensure that no permutation yields a number with leading zeros unless the entire number is `0`.

### Conclusion
The output hints indicate that the function may not properly handle cases where no valid permutations exist. Additionally, the lack of a length check in `is_valid_number` means that the function might return invalid candidates.

Given these considerations, the program does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails when:
- The characters remaining after accounting for `sub` lead to no valid number being generated.
- The generated number violates the length condition as per the problem description.
