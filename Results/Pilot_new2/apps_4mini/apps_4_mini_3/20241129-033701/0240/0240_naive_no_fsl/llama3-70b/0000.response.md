To evaluate the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the function `func_1(s, t)` within the program.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads two strings, `s` (the shuffled string containing digits of `n` and the digit count) and `t` (the remembered substring).
2. **Set Creation**: It creates a set `t_set` from the characters of `t` to facilitate quick look-up.
3. **Construct Number `n`**:
   - The program constructs a new string `n` by iterating over each character `c` in `s` and appending it to `n` if `c` is in `t_set`.
   - Finally, it appends `t` to `n`.
4. **Conversion to Integer**: The resulting string `n` is converted to an integer and returned.

### Problem Description Requirements
The task is to reconstruct the smallest integer `n` such that:
- It contains a substring `t`.
- The length of `n` is the length of `n` plus the digit count of `n`, appended as `k`.

### Potential Issues in Logic
1. **Leading Zeros**: The returned value from `func_1` is converted to an integer, which removes leading zeros. This means `n` may not be the smallest possible number. For example, if `s` contains the digits '003512' and `t` is '021', the correct logic should allow for the preservation of the structure that leads to '30021' rather than just picking digits that match those in `t`.

2. **Digit Count Handling**: The program does not verify if the constructed `n` (with `t` appended) has a proper digit count `k`, which is critical as per the problem statement. The correct `n` should have a length equal to `len(n) + len(k)` where `k` is specific to the length of `n`.

3. **Example Failure Case**:
   - Consider `s = "003512"` and `t = "021"`.
   - The program constructs `n` by picking '3', '0', '0', '2', and '1' resulting in something like '30021'.
   - However, it does not explicitly ensure that this is the smallest valid number that satisfies the conditions.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle the reconstruction of the smallest possible integer `n` due to its treatment of leading zeros and lack of checks for the digit count condition. Thus, it can produce incorrect outputs in situations where the order of digits from `s` matters, or where leading zeros impact the result.

Correctness: **False**
