DEBUG - description: There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.


-----Example-----
Input

DEBUG - description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output

-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.

DEBUG - description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.
