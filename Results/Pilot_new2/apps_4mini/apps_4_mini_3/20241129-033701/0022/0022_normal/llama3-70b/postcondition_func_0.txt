The function accepts a string input `s` consisting of English letters and checks if it is a palindrome. If `s` reads the same forwards and backwards, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not handle cases where the input is empty or contains non-English letters, but the problem statement specifies that `s` will have a length between 1 and 1000, so those cases are not expected to occur.
