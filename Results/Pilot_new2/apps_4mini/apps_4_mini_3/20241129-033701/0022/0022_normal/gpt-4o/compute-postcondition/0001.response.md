According to the code, the loop is set to execute `n // 2` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2. Since `n` is defined as being equal to the length of the string `s`, and `s` has a length between 1 and 1000, we can conclude that for the loop to execute, `s` must have a length of at least 2. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0 at the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is 0**
