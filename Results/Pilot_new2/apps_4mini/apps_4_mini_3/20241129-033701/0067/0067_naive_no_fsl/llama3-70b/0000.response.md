To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we analyze the logic implemented in the code against the problem statement.

**Problem Understanding**:
- We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
- The output should be:
  - "+" if the total upvotes are definitively more than downvotes.
  - "-" if the total downvotes are definitively more than upvotes.
  - "0" if upvotes and downvotes are equal with no unknown votes.
  - "?" if the result can be uncertain due to the unknown votes.

**Program Logic**:
1. Read inputs `x`, `y`, `z`.
2. Check if `x > y + z`:
   - If true, print '+' (definitely more upvotes).
3. Check if `x < y`:
   - If true, print '-' (definitely more downvotes).
4. Check if `x == y`:
   - If `z == 0`, print '0' (equal votes, no unknowns).
   - Else, print '?' (uncertain due to unknown votes).
5. If none of the above conditions hold, print '?'.

**Test Cases**:
1. Input: `3 7 0` -> Expected output: `-` (3 < 7, no uncertainty)
2. Input: `2 0 1` -> Expected output: `+` (2 > 0, no uncertainty)
3. Input: `1 1 0` -> Expected output: `0` (1 == 1, no uncertainty)
4. Input: `0 0 1` -> Expected output: `?` (uncertain due to 1 unknown vote)

**Edge Cases**:
- Input: `0 1 1` -> In this case, the program would print '?' (1 possible downvote and 1 unknown vote makes it uncertain), which is correct.
- Input: `1 0 1` -> The program would print '+' because the one upvote can guarantee it is more than the one downvote. This is correct.
- Input: `100 100 0` -> Expected output: `0`, this case is also handled correctly.
- Input: `10 5 5` -> Here, the program would print '?' because the unknown votes can swing the result either way. This is also correct.

**Critical Edge Cases**:
1. Input: `0 0 0` -> Expected output: `0` (x == y and z == 0). The program does not handle this case directly but will still print '?' since it will fall through to the last condition. This is an error.

2. Input: `100 100 1` -> Expected output: `?` (since the unknown vote can make the upvotes either more than or equal to downvotes), but the program would print '?' which is correct.

In summary, the code fails for the case where all votes are zero (`0, 0, 0`), where it should print `0` but instead falls through and prints `?`. 

Thus, there exists a case where the program does not meet the expected output.

Correctness: **False**.
