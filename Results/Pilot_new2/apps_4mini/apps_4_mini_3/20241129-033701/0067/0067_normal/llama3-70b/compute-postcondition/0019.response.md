Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` via input, where each integer is in the range of 0 to 100. It compares `x` with `y` and `z` in various conditions: if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'; if `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'; if `x` is equal to `y`, it checks `z` and prints '0' if `z` is 0 or '?' if `z` is greater than 0; if `x` is not equal to `y` and is less than or equal to `y + z`, it prints '?'. The function does not return any values, only prints output based on these conditions.**
