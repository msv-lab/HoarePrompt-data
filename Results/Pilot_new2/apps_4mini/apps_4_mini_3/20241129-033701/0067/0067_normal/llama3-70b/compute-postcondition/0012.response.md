Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `z` is equal to 0, then `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is greater than 0.***
