The `print('?')` statement outputs the string '?' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the console output. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`. The output is '?'**
