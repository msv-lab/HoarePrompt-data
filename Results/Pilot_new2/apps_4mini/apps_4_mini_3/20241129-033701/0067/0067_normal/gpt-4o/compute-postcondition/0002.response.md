The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The value of `x` is an integer from input, and the value of `z` is an integer between 0 and 100. Therefore, the value of `max_upvotes` will be equal to the input integer `x` plus an integer value `z` that is in the range from 0 to 100. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.**
