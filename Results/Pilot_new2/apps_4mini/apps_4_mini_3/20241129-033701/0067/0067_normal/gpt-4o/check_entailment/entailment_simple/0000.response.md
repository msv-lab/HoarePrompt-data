Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all scenarios. 

### Explanation of the Issues:
1. **Handling of the Output**:
    - The logic to determine whether to print `"+"`, `"-"`, or `"?"` is flawed.
    - The program checks if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` to print `"-"`. This is correct.
    - It then checks if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` to print `"+"`. However, this doesn't consider cases where the results could be ambiguous due to the presence of unknown voters (`z`). For instance, if `x=2`, `y=2`, `z=1`, then `max_upvotes` would be `3` and `min_downvotes` would still be `2`, leading to `print("+"`, which is incorrect because the result can also be `"-"` if the unknown voter downvotes.
  
2. **Ambiguous Cases**:
    - The current structure fails to analyze the conditions where both outcomes are possible. For example, if `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`, the maximum upvotes could be `2` and minimum downvotes could also be `1`, leading to uncertainty, which the program does not capture correctly by outputting `"?"`.

3. **Missing Result for Equal Votes**:
    - The program fails to handle the case when `max_upvotes` equals `max_downvotes`, which should result in a `"?"` output as there can be instances of equal votes depending on how the unknown voters vote.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all edge cases and ambiguous scenarios as outlined in the problem description, thus it is deemed incorrect.
