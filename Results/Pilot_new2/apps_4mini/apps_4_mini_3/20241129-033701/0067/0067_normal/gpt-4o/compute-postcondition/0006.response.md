The code `print('-')` does not alter any variables; it simply outputs the character `'-'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions are still valid after executing the code.

Output State: **`x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer between 0 and 100; `z` is an integer between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`.**
