Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic defined in the problem description. Here's how it handles each case:

1. It first checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If they are equal, it prints "YES", which is correct because the first element of the sequence is `a`, and if `b` is the same, it appears in the sequence.

2. It checks if the difference `c` is 0. If `c` is 0, the entire sequence is constant (all elements are equal to `a`). If `b` is not equal to `a`, it should print "NO", which the program correctly does.

3. In the case where `c` is not 0, it checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which verifies if `b` can be reached by stepping from `a` with a step size of `c`. Additionally, it checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which ensures that the steps are in the positive direction (since `i` must be a positive integer). If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES".

4. If none of the conditions are met, it defaults to printing "NO".

The program covers all edge cases outlined in the examples, including:
- Positive differences when `b > a`.
- The case where `b` is equal to `a`.
- The case where there are no valid steps to reach `b` (e.g., when `c` is positive and `b < a`).
- Cases where `c` is 0 and only one value can appear in the sequence.

Since the program correctly implements the required logic and covers all potential scenarios, the correctness evaluation is "True".
