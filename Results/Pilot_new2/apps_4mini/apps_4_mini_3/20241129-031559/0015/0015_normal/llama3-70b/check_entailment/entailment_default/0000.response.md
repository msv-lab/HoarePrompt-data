To assess the program's correctness against the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and its logic:

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**: The sequence starts with an integer `a` and has a constant difference `c` between successive elements. We need to determine if a favorite integer `b` appears in this sequence. 

2. **Code Breakdown**:
   - The code checks if `c` is `0`. If so, it only checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO". This part correctly handles the case where no new elements are generated (since all would be `a`).
   - If `c` is not `0`, it checks whether `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and whether `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. This ensures that the sequence can reach `b` from `a` through valid steps of size `c`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `c > 0`, the sequence increases from `a`. So if `b < a`, the answer should be "NO", which is correctly handled by the condition `(b - a) / c >= 0`.
   - If `c < 0`, the sequence decreases from `a`. If `b > a`, the answer should also be "NO". The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` would handle this as `(b - a)` would be positive and `c` would be negative, hence their division would yield a negative result.
   - Ensure consideration of the edge case where `b = a`, which is already covered, as it would output "YES".

4. **Output Hints Validation**: The output hints correctly summarize what the function does based on the logic presented in the code. They accurately describe the conditions under which "YES" or "NO" are printed.

5. **Conclusion**: After analyzing the logic, checking edge cases, and validating against the output hints, the code appears to handle all specified conditions correctly. There are no cases where the code fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly checks all scenarios: when `c` is `0`, when `c` is positive, and when `c` is negative, thus fulfilling the problem's requirements.
