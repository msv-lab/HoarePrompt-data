The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are constrained to the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, based on the given constraints alone, we cannot determine what the function returns or its functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on three integer variables a, b, and c within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. The return value is not specified.**
