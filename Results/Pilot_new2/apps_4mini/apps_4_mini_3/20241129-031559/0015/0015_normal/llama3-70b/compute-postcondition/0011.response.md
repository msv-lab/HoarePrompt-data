The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change as a result of this operation. The expression conditions stated in the initial state remain valid because they do not alter any variable or state, but only specify the conditions under which the print statement is executed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, and `c` is not equal to 0. The expression `(b - a) % c` is not equal to 0 or `(b - a) / c` is negative. Output: 'NO'**
