The code executes the `print` statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as no assignments or calculations are performed on them. Therefore, the conditions about their values remain valid. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input; `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0; 'NO' is printed.**
