The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the given constraints, it operates with three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of which can range from -10^9 to 10^9. Since there is no output specification provided in the instruction, the return value of the function is not defined in this case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to be determined based on the context in which it operates without explicit input or output parameters described.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
