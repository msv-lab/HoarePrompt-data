The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected. They remain as integers within their defined ranges.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10; `total_sum` is 0.**
