#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10.
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the number of unique characters in the string representation of n is less than or equal to k, where n is an integer between l and r.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and returns True if the number of unique digits in the decimal representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns False. This assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer within the specified range, but does not handle cases where `n` is negative, which is outside the defined input constraints.

    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_sum` is the sum of all `num` values in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, `num` is equal to `r`, `l` is at least 1, `r` is less than \(10^{18}\). If `func_1(num, k)` never evaluates to true for any `num`, then `total_sum` remains 0.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns the sum of all `num` values in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, where `total_sum` is the calculated sum and it remains 0 if `func_1(num, k)` never evaluates to true for any `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `l` and `r`, where 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, and an integer `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. It calculates and returns the sum of all integers in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy a condition defined by another function `func_1(num, k)`. If no integers in that range satisfy the condition, the function returns 0. The resulting sum is computed modulo a constant `MOD`.
