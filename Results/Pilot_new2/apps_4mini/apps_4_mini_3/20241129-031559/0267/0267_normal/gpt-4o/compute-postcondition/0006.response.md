The code updates `total_sum` by adding `num` to it and then takes the result modulo `MOD`. The previous state shows that `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l + 1`, and other constraints on `l` and `r` still apply. The impact of the code is that `total_sum` will now hold a new value based on the provided calculations.

Let's compute the new value of `total_sum`:
- The initial value of `total_sum` is `l % MOD`.
- The value of `num` is `l + 1`.
- Thus, the new `total_sum` will be `((l % MOD) + (l + 1)) % MOD`.

The other variables are not affected, and the constraints remain valid.

Output State: **`total_sum` is `((l % MOD) + (l + 1)) % MOD`, `num` is `l + 1`, `l` is at least 1, `r` must be at least `l + 1`, and `r` is less than \(10^{18}\) if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true.**
