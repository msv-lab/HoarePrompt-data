The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Both `l` and `r` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18. The parameter `k` is also an integer constrained such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. The function calculates the sum of all integer values `num` in the inclusive range from `l` to `r` that satisfy a condition defined by another function `func_1(num, k)`. If no values in this range satisfy the condition, the total sum remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r`, and an integer `k`, and return the sum of integers from `l` to `r` that meet the criteria established by `func_1`, defaulting to 0 if none do. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l, r, and k, and returns the sum of all integers from l to r that satisfy the condition defined by func_1; if none satisfy, it returns 0.**
