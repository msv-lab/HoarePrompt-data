To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description and annotations, we need to analyze the code's logic and how it adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to sum the integers from `l` to `r`, inclusive, only if each integer contains at most `k` different digits.
- The output should be the sum modulo `998244353`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function appears to make use of a helper function `count(n, k, dp)` to calculate the total count of valid numbers up to `r` and subtracts the count of valid numbers up to `l-1`.
   - The result is then taken modulo `MOD` (assumed to be `998244353`).

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating valid numbers based on the constraints of `k`.
   - If `n` is less than `10^k`, it returns `n`, which means all numbers up to `n` are considered valid.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^k`, it computes a formula that attempts to count numbers with at most `k` different digits based on previous results stored in a memoization dictionary (`dp`).

### Potential Issues:
- The key issue arises from how the counting is performed in the `count` function. The program computes valid numbers based solely on the digit count without ensuring that each number from `l` to `r` actually meets the requirement of at most `k` different digits.
- **No Check for Individual Numbers**: The `count` function does not validate each number between `l` and `r`, and instead relies on mathematical derivations. This could lead to incorrect counts, especially in cases where certain numbers within the range have more than `k` digits but still fall under the mathematical formula used in `count`.
  
- **Example Case**: Consider a case where `l = 100`, `r = 105`, and `k = 2`. The numbers 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, and 105 all have three different digits (1, 0, 2/3/4/5). However, if the counting logic in `count` incorrectly considers these numbers valid due to its mathematical approach, it will yield an incorrect sum since none of these numbers should be counted.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not explicitly validate each individual number between `l` and `r` to ensure it meets the criteria of having at most `k` different digits, it can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
