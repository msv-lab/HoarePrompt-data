According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `k`. The loop is set to run for `i` in the range from 1 to `k - 1`. This means that for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 2; otherwise, the range will be empty and the loop will not run. 

As for the state variables, `l`, `r`, and `dp[n, k]` are not directly affecting the loop execution but can be retained in the state. At the start of the loop, `i` will take the value of 1 in the first iteration.

So, to satisfy the execution condition of the loop:
- `k` must be greater than 1.
- Initially, `i` will be 1 when the loop begins.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is 1**
