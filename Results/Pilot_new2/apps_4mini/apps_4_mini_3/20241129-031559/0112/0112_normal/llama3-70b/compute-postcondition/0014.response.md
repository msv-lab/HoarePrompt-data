The code `print(max_num)` outputs the value of `max_num`, which is formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` sorted in descending order. The state of the variables that were provided remains unchanged, except for the output of `max_num`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the last list in `cubes`; `digits` includes string representations of all unique integers from all lists in `cubes`; `max_num` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` sorted in descending order; `max_num` is printed.**
