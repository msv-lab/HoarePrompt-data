The code snippet is executing a generator expression that updates the `digits` set with the string representations of the integers from the list `cube`. The value of `cube` is not explicitly stated in the initial state; however, it is assumed to be a list of integers.

The impact of the code is that it will add new string representations of the integers in `cube` to the `digits` set. The values of `n`, `cubes`, and `cube` remain unchanged, but the `digits` variable is updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include new string representations of integers from `cube`**.
