In this case, the variable `used_cubes` at index `i` (which is 3) is set to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters; `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list; `i` is 3; `used_cubes[3]` is True.**
