According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the loop will execute at least once because `n` is at least 1. 

The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. Since `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, the third character (which is `digit`) is already set correctly based on the state provided. The variable `found` is False, but its value does not affect the execution of the loop. The state of `used_cubes` will not change until the loop body is executed.

Thus, for the loop to be executed:
- `i` needs to be initialized to 0 for the first iteration,
- `n` is already valid (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3),
- `digit` is the third character and `used_cubes` reflects the correct state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `used_cubes` reflects which cubes were used, marked as True for those that matched the condition, `i` is 0**
