To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the output hints in detail.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the largest natural number \( x \) such that all integers from 1 to \( x \) can be formed using the numbers on the faces of a given set of cubes. The constraints specify that leading zeros are not allowed, and a digit '6' cannot be formed using '9' and vice versa.

### Code Review:
1. The main function `func_1(n, cubes)`:
   - It imports `product` from `itertools` but does not use it, which is unnecessary.
   - It initializes \( x \) to 0 and checks if `can_form_number(x + 1)` is true. If so, it increments \( x \) until it can no longer form the next number.

2. The helper function `can_form_number(num)`:
   - This function checks if each digit of the number `num` can be matched to the cubes. It iterates through the digits and checks if the digit is on an unused cube.
   - If a digit cannot be matched, it returns `False`.

### Output Hints:
The hints indicate that the function returns the maximum integer \( x \) such that all digits from 1 to \( x \) can be formed. If any digit is missing, the function will stop and return the last valid \( x \).

### Edge Cases Consideration:
1. **Single Cube Case**: If \( n = 1 \) and the single cube does not have certain digits (for example, only contains [0,1,2,3,4,5]), it will not be able to form many numbers starting from 1.
   
2. **Leading Zeros**: If a cube has a zero on it, it should not be used for the first digit of a number unless that number is '0'. The current implementation does not explicitly handle cases where a number with leading zeros might be formed.
   
3. **Digit 6 and 9 Distinction**: If cubes contain both digits 6 and 9, the program must ensure that these digits are treated distinctly. The current implementation does not account for this requirement.

### Additional Tests:
- If cubes are constructed with digits that do not allow forming the required numbers, like having no '1' to '6' on any cube.
- If the maximum number formed is indeed correct; for example, cubes with [0,1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,0,1], [2,3,4,5,6,7] should allow forming numbers up to '87', as indicated in the example, but not '88' since there are not enough cubes with '8'.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, particularly the issue with leading zeros and the necessary distinct handling of digits 6 and 9, the program does not fully comply with the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle cases where leading zeros might appear or when digits 6 and 9 need to be treated as distinct. For instance, if we try to form numbers like '10', '20', etc. using a cube that has a zero as one of the faces but cannot be used as the leading digit, it fails to validate correctly.
