The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `i` is 1, `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
