Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, indicating that `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces`. The `used_cubes` list reflects which cubes were used, marked as True for those that matched the condition, but since `found` is False, no cubes are marked True in this case.***
