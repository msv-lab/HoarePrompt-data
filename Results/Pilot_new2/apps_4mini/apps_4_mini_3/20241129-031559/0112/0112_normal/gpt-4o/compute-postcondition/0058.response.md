Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, and `i` is 3. If `used_cubes[3]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[3]`, then `used_cubes[3]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
