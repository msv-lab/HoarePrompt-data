The code assigns `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. The value of `i` is 4, so `used_cubes[4]` is set to `True`. The initial state does not provide information about the `used_cubes` list, but it is implied that it has at least 5 elements (from index 0 to index 4). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is 4, `used_cubes[4]` is True.**
