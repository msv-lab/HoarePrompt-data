The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters; `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list; `found` is False; `used_cubes` reflects which cubes were used, marked as True for those that matched the condition, and remains unchanged for those that did not match.
