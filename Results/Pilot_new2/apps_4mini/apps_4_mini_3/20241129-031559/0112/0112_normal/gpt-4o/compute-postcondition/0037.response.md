According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the current value of `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, allowing `i` to increment to 2. Therefore, to execute the loop again, the state needs to reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1, and `n` must be strictly greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `i` is 2**
