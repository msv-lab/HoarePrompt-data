In this case, the statement `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the `i`-th index of the `used_cubes` list to `True`. Given that `i` is 1, this means the second element (index 1) of the `used_cubes` list will now hold the value `True`.

The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, and `i` is 1. The state of `used_cubes` is not specified in the initial state, but it can be inferred that it is a list capable of being indexed.

Since we are updating the second element of `used_cubes`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[1]` is set to True.**
