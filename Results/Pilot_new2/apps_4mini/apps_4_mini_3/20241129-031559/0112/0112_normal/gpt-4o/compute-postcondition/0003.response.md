The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `digits`, and `digit`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, and `found` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is False.**
