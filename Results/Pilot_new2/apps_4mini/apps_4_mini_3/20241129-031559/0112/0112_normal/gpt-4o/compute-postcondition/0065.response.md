Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list. After all iterations, `found` is False, indicating that no `used_cubes[i]` was set to True where `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. The initial state of `used_cubes` remains unchanged from its initial state.***
