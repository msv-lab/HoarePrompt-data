To assess the given program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and code step-by-step.

**Problem Description:**
Nikolay has `a` lemons, `b` apples, and `c` pears. The fruits need to be in a ratio of 1:2:4 (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) to make a compote. The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in this ratio. 

**Program:**
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

**Initial Assessment of the Code:**
1. The program reads three integers for lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates `max_lemons`, which represents the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed given the available fruits.
3. The total number of fruits used in all sets is calculated and printed.

**Edge Cases:**
- If Nikolay has no valid combinations of fruits (e.g., not enough pears), the program should correctly return 0.
- The implementation assumes valid input as integers and does not handle cases where inputs might be outside the specified range.
- Since the problem specifies that the inputs are positive integers within the range [1, 1000], this assumption should be valid, but we need to ensure that the computation does not lead to invalid states.

**Examining Output Hints:**
The output hints suggest the function calculates the total fruits correctly but does not handle invalid input types or constraints. However, given the constraints (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000), there shouldn't be any invalid cases.

**Validation Against Examples:**
1. For inputs `2, 5, 7`:
   - `max_lemons = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
   - `total_fruits = 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 4 = 7` (Correct)
  
2. For inputs `4, 7, 13`:
   - `max_lemons = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
   - `total_fruits = 3 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 21` (Correct)

3. For inputs `2, 3, 2`:
   - `max_lemons = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
   - `total_fruits = 0` (Correct)

**Conclusion:**
The code correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the specified ratios and handles the provided examples accurately. The output hints about the lack of handling for invalid input types are not applicable here, as the problem description guarantees valid inputs. Thus, after thorough examination, I conclude that the code adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
