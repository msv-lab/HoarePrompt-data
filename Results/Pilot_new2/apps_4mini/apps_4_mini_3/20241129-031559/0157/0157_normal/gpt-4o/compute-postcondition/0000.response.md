The value of `a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is still a positive integer, but now it has been updated to the integer value taken from input. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer based on input, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
