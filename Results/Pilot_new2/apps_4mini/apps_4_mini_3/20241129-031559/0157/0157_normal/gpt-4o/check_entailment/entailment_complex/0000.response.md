Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description. Here’s why it correctly meets the specified criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. This matches the problem's requirement.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed based on the given ratio of 1 lemon: 2 apples: 4 pears. This is done using the expression `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which correctly determines the maximum possible number of sets of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used without exceeding the available numbers of each fruit type. 

3. **Total Fruit Calculation**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   - 1 lemon contributes `max_lemons * 1`
   - 2 apples contribute `max_lemons * 2`
   - 4 pears contribute `max_lemons * 4`
   Hence, the total is computed as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which results in the correct total number of fruits.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of fruits used, which is consistent with the output requirement of the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program also handles edge cases implicitly. For instance, if there are not enough pears to make even one complete set (i.e., `c < 4`), `max_lemons` will be computed as zero, leading the total fruits to be zero, which aligns with the expectation that no fruits can be used in such a case.

The program does not include any error handling for invalid inputs outside the specified constraints (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) or invalid types. However, since the problem specifies that the inputs will be positive integers meeting these constraints, this limitation does not affect the correctness of the program for the scenarios defined in the problem description.

Thus, the program meets all outlined requirements and correctly computes the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote.
