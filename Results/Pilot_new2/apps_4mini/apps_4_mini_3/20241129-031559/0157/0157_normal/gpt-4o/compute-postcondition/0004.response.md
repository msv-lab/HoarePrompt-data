The variable `total_fruits` is assigned the value of `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. The value of `max_lemons` is already determined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Thus, the value of `total_fruits` can be calculated as `max_lemons * 7`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer based on input, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`.**
