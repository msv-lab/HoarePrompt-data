The program is designed to calculate the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in a compote, adhering to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program reads three integers representing the quantities of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum of:
   - `a` (the number of lemons available),
   - `b // 2` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available apples, since 1 lemon requires 2 apples),
   - `c // 4` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the available pears, since 1 lemon requires 4 pears).
3. The total is then computed as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `7 * min_lemon`.

### Edge Cases Consideration:
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` are such that none can satisfy the compote requirements (e.g., if `b` is 1 or `c` is 1), then the program should return 0.
- If any of the inputs are at their minimum (e.g., `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`), the program should still correctly handle and return 0, since the minimum number of fruits needed to make a compote would not be met.

### Review of Output Hints:
The output hints suggest that the function calculates and prints the maximum number of fruits used in the compote based on the ratios provided. They describe how `min_lemon` is used to ensure that the quantities are correctly calculated according to the ratios.

### Conclusion:
1. The code correctly implements the logic needed to determine `min_lemon` based on the ratios.
2. The output hints align with the code, affirming that the code indeed handles the calculations as described.
3. The program sufficiently accounts for all possible edge cases according to the problem description (e.g., returning 0 when fruits are insufficient).

Since I can't find any example where the program does not work correctly in line with the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
