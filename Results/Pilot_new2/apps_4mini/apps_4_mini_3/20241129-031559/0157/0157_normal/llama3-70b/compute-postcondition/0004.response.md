To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code, we start with the initial state and examine the impact of the code.

Initial State: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

The code:
```
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

1. The value of `min_lemon` will remain unchanged as it is a precomputed value based on the inputs.
2. The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)` which is `min_lemon * 7`.
3. The `print` statement outputs the result, but it does not change any variable.

Thus, the output can be expressed as a computation involving `min_lemon`, but since we must maintain a specific expression format and not introduce new variables, the output state will reflect the unchanged values and the computation performed.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the printed result is `min_lemon * 7`**.
