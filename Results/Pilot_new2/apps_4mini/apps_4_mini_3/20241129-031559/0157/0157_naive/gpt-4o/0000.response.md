To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's break down the logic.

The problem requires us to find the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to make a compote in the ratio of 1:2:4. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) that can be used based on the available fruits:
- For every lemon, it requires 2 apples and 4 pears.
- Thus, the maximum number of lemons that can be used is determined by the minimum of:
  - The number of lemons available (`a`)
  - The number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`)
  - The number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`)

Once it calculates `max_lemons`, the program computes the total number of fruits used as follows:
- 1 lemon contributes 1 to the total
- 2 apples contribute 2 to the total
- 4 pears contribute 4 to the total

The total fruits used will therefore be `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`.

### Check for Edge Cases:
1. If `a`, `b`, or `c` is not sufficient to make even one set of the compote (i.e., at least 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears), the program correctly computes `max_lemons` as 0, resulting in a total of 0 fruits, as seen in the third example where `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`.
   
2. When the available fruits are such that they can make multiple sets of compote, like in the second example where `a = 4`, `b = 7`, and `c = 13`, the program calculates `max_lemons` correctly as 3, yielding a total of 21.

3. In the first example with `a = 2`, `b = 5`, and `c = 7`, the program again correctly computes the total as 7 by using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all potential edge cases outlined in the problem description. It accurately determines the maximum number of fruits that can be used based on the given ratios, including cases where not enough fruits are available to make a compote. 

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
