Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the given ratios of lemons, apples, and pears (1:2:4). Here's the breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of the fruit using the formula `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which ensures that the number of fruits used adheres to the required ratios without exceeding the available quantities.
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote by summing the appropriate multiples: `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which corresponds to the total fruits based on the maximum complete sets determined.

The program effectively handles all potential edge cases, including cases where not enough of one or more types of fruit are available to form a complete set of the compote. For example:
- If `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, the program correctly outputs `0` since there are not enough pears to make even one set.
  
Thus, given the logic and the adherence to the problem description, the program is correct for all valid inputs within the specified ranges.
