To determine the necessary modifications for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while` loop can run.

The loop condition is `char in s`. For the loop to execute, the variable `char` must be found within the string `s`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `s` contains no characters.
- `char` is `final_char + 1`.
- `original_s` contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`.
- `final_char` is less than 'y'.

Since `s` is empty (contains no characters), `char` (which is `final_char + 1`) cannot be found in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be modified to ensure that it includes `char`. 

Since `char` is defined as `final_char + 1`, which is guaranteed to be one character greater than the maximum character in `original_s`, `s` needs to contain `char` for the loop to execute. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`s` must contain `char`, `res` contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to `final_char`, `char` is `final_char + 1`, and `original_s` contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`, and `final_char` is less than 'y'**.
