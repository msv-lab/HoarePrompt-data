According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the `alphabet`. The variable `final_char` is less than 'y', which implies that the loop can continue until all characters from the `alphabet` are processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains no characters, and `res` contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to `final_char`, with `char` being `final_char + 2`. Since `final_char` is less than 'y', the next `char` in the `alphabet` would be `final_char + 1`, allowing the loop to execute one more time.

We must also account for the fact that in the next iteration, the loop will process the next character after `final_char`. Therefore, we need to adjust `final_char` to reflect that we are now considering the next character in the sequence, which is `final_char + 1`.

State: **`s` contains no characters, `res` contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to `final_char`, `char` is `final_char + 1`, `original_s` contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`, and `final_char` is less than 'y'.**
