The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1`, but it does not change any variables or their values in the program. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `res` contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to 'z' based on their occurrences in the original string, `char` is 'z', `s` must have contained characters from 'a' to 'z', and the length of `res` is not equal to 26.**
