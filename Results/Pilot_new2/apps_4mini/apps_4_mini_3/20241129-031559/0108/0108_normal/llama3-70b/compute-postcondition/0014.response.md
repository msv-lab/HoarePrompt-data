According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `char` in `alphabet`. The value of `char` at the end of the last iteration is `final_char + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be less than or equal to 'z', and `alphabet` must include the next character. Since `char` is `final_char + 1`, and `original_s` must have contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`, `final_char` must be less than 'z' for the loop to proceed.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` is `final_char + 1`, which implies that to execute one more time, `char` needs to be updated to `final_char + 2`. Therefore, `final_char` must be less than 'y' (so that `final_char + 2` does not exceed 'z').

State: **`s` contains characters from `final_char + 1` to `z`, `res` contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to `final_char`, `char` is `final_char + 2`, and `original_s` must have contained characters from 'a' to `final_char` and `final_char` must be less than 'y'.**
