In the code snippet provided, `j` is incremented by 1. The current value of `j` before the operation is 0, as stated in the initial conditions. Thus, after the operation, `j` will be equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state reflecting these changes is as follows:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `target[j-1]`, which equals `target[0]`.**
