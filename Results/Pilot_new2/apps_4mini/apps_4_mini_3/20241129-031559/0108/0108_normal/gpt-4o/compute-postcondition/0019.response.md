The code snippet `print(target)` outputs the value of `target`, which does not modify any variables. The initial state indicates that `j` is equal to `target_len` and that all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that the characters of `target` were indeed found in `s` and it confirms the presence of `target`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to 26 indicating that all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order; `target` is printed.**
