The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is known to be less than 26, so after the increment, `j` will be less than or equal to 26. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length greater than 1; `j` is now `j + 1`, which is still less than or equal to 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length greater than 1; `j` is now `j + 1`, which is less than or equal to 26.**
