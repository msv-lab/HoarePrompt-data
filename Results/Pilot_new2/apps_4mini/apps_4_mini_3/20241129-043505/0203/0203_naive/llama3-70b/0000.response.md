Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not accurately simulate the voting process as described in the problem statement. It simply counts the number of employees in each fraction (depublicans and remocrats) and decides the winner based on the majority, which does not account for the voting mechanics where employees can deny others the right to vote.

Here are specific cases where the program fails:

1. **Input:** 
   ```
   5
   DDDRR
   ```
   - In this case, the first employee (D) could deny the fifth employee (R) immediately. Then, the second employee (D) could deny the third employee (R), leaving only the first and second employees (both D) eligible to vote. Thus, the outcome should be 'D'.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   6
   RRRRRR
   ```
   - The program will output 'R', which is correct, but it does not take into account that since all are remocrats, they could strategically deny the last remocrat to ensure the first remains, thus potentially leading to different outcomes based on how the voting plays out.

The logic of simply counting the fractions ignores the dynamic interactions of voting and denying, leading to incorrect outcomes in more complex scenarios. Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem's requirements and is incorrect.
