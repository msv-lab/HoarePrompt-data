The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which captures a string from user input. The initial condition states that the string consists only of the characters 'D' and 'R' and has a length equal to the positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). However, the exact content of `fractions` is not known, as it depends on user input. The precondition regarding the length of the string remains valid. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R' from user input.**
