The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `fractions` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n + 1`, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n + 1`, `remocrats` is increased by 1**
