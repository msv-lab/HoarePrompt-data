The value of `i` is appended to `d_queue`. The state of `d_queue` will now include the previous elements plus the current value of `i`. The other variables `n`, `votes`, and `r_queue` remain unchanged, and the precondition remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is the current index; `votes` must have a length greater than `i`; if `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` includes the current value of `i`, and `d_queue` now includes `i` as well.
