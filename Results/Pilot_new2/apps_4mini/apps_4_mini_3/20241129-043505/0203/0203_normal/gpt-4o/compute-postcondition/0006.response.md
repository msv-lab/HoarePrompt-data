The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The value of `i` is currently 0. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` has not been defined, but after running this line, `d_queue` will now contain the value `[0]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string of characters 'D' and 'R', `i` is 0, `v` is 'D', `d_queue` is [0]**
