`r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue`, which is removed from `r_queue` using the `pop(0)` method. The variable `d_queue` remains unaffected as the operation only modifies `r_queue`. After the operation, `r_queue` will have one less index, and `d_index` remains unchanged since it pertains to `d_queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` has one less index; `r_queue` has one less index and `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` has one less index; `r_queue` has one less index; `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.**
