According to the code, the loop iterates over the `votes` string using `enumerate`, which means that the loop will execute for every character in the string `votes`. For the loop to execute at least once, the string `votes` must contain at least one character. 

Given that `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, it implies that `n` could be used to determine the length of the `votes` string. However, the condition does not specifically ensure that `votes` contains characters since it only restricts the value of `n`. 

To summarize, we need to ensure that:
1. The `votes` string is not empty (i.e., it has at least one character). 
2. The loop variables `i` and `v` should start at 0 and the first character of `votes`, respectively.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of characters 'D' and 'R' that must not be empty, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of votes**.
