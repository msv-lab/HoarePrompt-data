Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has an additional element `d_index + n` appended, and `r_queue` has one less index, with `r_index` as the first element that was in `r_queue` and `d_index` as the first element that was in `d_queue`. Otherwise, `d_queue` has one less index, `r_queue` has one more index with the last element being `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`, while `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.***
