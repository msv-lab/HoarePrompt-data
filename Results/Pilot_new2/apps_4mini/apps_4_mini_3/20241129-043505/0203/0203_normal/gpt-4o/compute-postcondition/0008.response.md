The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the current value of `i`, which is 0, to the list `r_queue`. The variables `n`, `votes`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `r_queue` will have a new element added.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of characters 'D' and 'R' that must not be empty, `i` is 0, `v` is 'R', and `r_queue` now includes the value 0.**
