The code appends `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The value of `n` is given as an input integer that lies between 1 and 200,000, and `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`. Therefore, the new value being added to `r_queue` is `r_index + n`, which results in `r_queue` having one additional element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` has one less index; `r_queue` has one more index with the last element being `r_index + n`; `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.**
