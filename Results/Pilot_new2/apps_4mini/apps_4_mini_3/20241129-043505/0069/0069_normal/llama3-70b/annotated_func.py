#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, x is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, and s is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt0, cnt1 = s.count('0'), s.count('1')
        
        balance = cnt0 - cnt1
        
        if balance == x:
            print(n + 1)
        elif (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, for each test case `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. After all iterations, for each test case, either `n + 1` has been printed if `balance` equals `x`, `-1` has been printed if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, or `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` has been printed otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s` to determine a `balance`. It then returns results based on the comparison of `balance` with `x`. Specifically, it prints `n + 1` if `balance` equals `x`, `-1` if the difference `(x - balance)` is exactly divisible by the difference in counts (`cnt0 - cnt1`), and otherwise it prints the integer result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. Edge cases include scenarios where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, which would lead to a division by zero error in the second condition; however, the code does not handle this case specifically and may lead to incorrect behavior if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`.
