The values of `n` and `x` are assigned based on the `input` function which accepts two integers and maps them to the respective variables. The values of `n` and `x` must be positive integers between 1 and 100000 and integers between -10^9 and 10^9, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 from input, `x` is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9 from input, `s` is a binary string of length `n`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 from input, `x` is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9 from input, `s` is a binary string of length `n`.**
