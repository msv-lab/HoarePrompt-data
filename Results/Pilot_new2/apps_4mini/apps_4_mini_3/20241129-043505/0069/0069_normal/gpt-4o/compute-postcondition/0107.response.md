Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 11 or `n + 11`, `results` is a list that still meets the conditions imposed by the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` contains `n + 1` elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and `count` is the number of times the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0` was satisfied for each element in `prefix_balances`. If the loop does not execute, `count` remains 0.**
