Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 8 or `n + 8`, depending on the value of `balance`. If `balance` is equal to 0, and if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` is now a list containing -1; otherwise, it contains 0 in addition to its previous values. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` now includes the value of `count`. Additionally, `n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[7]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with `prefix_balances[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0.***
