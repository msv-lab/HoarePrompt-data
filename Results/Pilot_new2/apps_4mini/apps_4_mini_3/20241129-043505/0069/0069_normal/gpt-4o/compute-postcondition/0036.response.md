Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 6, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of size at least 7, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1 (new value is `count + 1`). Otherwise, the value of `count` remains unchanged.***
