The code `results.append(-1)` adds the value `-1` to the `results` list. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `results` now includes the value `-1`, while the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 8, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, which is currently 0, `results` is now a list containing -1 (if it was previously either -1 or [0] or a list with the value of `count`), `n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[7]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with `prefix_balances[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and if `n` is 0, then `prefix_balances` is a list with one element being 0.**
