The operation `results.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the `results` list. The initial state of `results` is an empty list, so after this operation, `results` will contain a single element which is `0`. Other variables in the state remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 4, `results` is [0], `n` is an integer extracted from `data[1]`, `x` is int(data[2]), `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` for `i` in `1` to `n` is equal to the cumulative sum of `1` for '0's and `-1` for '1's in the substring `s[0:i-1]`, the current value of `balance` is 0, and `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`.**
