The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 11 or `n + 11`, `results` is a list containing `-1` added to its previous elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in `s`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `i` is equal to `n`, the current value of `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`.**
