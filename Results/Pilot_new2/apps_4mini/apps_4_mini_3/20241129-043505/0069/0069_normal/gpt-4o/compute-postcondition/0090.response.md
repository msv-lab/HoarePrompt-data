Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 11 or `n + 11`, `results` is a list that still meets the conditions imposed by the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in `s` where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the number of '0's minus the number of '1's from the start of the string `s` up to the `i-th` character, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `i` is equal to `n`, the current value of `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`.***
