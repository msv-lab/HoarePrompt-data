The variable `prefix_balances` is assigned a list containing `0` repeated `n + 1` times, where `n` is equal to `int(data[5])`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `prefix_balances`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 8, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `results` is either a list containing -1 or [0] or a list with the value of `count`, `n` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[7]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized to all 0s.**
