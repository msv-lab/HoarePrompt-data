The variable `index` is 1, and `data` is assumed to be a list with at least 3 elements due to the indexing used. The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to `s`. Since `index` is 1, `index + 2` evaluates to 3, meaning `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`. The other variables (`T`, `results`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer extracted from `data[1]`, `x` is int(data[2]), `s` is equal to `data[3]`**
