The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` represents the element in the list `data` at position `index`, which is 5. The value of `n` is determined by this assignment and is guaranteed to be an integer greater than or equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 5, `balance` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `results` is either a list containing -1 or [0] or a list with the value of `count`, `n` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `x` is int(data[2]), `s` is equal to `data[3]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`**
