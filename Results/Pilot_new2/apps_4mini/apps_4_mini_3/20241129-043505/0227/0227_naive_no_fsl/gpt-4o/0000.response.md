To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_1` against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have a sequence of distinct positive integers.
2. We are to determine the minimum number of variables `m` such that we can perform a sequence of operations:
   - The first operation assigns the first integer in the list to one of the variables.
   - Subsequent operations must assign sums of previously assigned variables to match the next integers in the list.
3. If it's impossible to perform the operations with any `m`, we should return `-1`.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The function starts by sorting the array `a`, which is necessary since we need to build up to the sums sequentially.
- It maintains a set `assigned` to keep track of integers that can be formed using the assigned variables.
- The first integer is assigned directly to one variable, initializing `m` to `1`.
- For each subsequent integer in `a`, it checks whether this integer can be formed as a sum of any two already assigned integers.
   - If it can be formed, no additional variable is needed.
   - If it cannot be formed, it increments `m` and adds the current integer to `assigned`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Single Element Case**: 
   - Input: `1` with `1`.
   - Expected Output: `1`.
   - The function will correctly return `1`.

2. **Impossible Case**:
   - Input: `3` with `3, 6, 5`.
   - Here, it is impossible to form `5` as no two natural numbers can add to it when starting from `3` and trying to only use the variables.
   - The program is expected to return `-1`. However, the code does not handle this correctly since it will not detect that `5` cannot be formed from `3` and `6`.

3. **General Case with Larger Numbers**:
   - Input: `6` with `2, 4, 8, 6, 10, 18`.
   - The program should evaluate the combinations and determine the minimum variables needed to create the sums progressively. The code appears to handle this as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle cases where certain integers cannot be formed by the sum of previous integers, leading to scenarios where it may output an incorrect value for `m`. The failure to detect such cases directly contradicts the problem requirements.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
