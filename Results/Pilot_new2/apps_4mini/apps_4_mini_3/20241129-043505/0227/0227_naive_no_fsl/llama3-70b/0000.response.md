Correctness: **False**

The provided code fails to handle certain cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it assumes that the only valid sequence of values for the variables \( b_i \) is based on doubling the previous value. However, this does not take into account all possible combinations of sums that can be formed from the previously assigned variables. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
1 3 4 7
```

According to the problem description, we should be able to perform the following operations:
1. Assign \( b_1 = 1 \)
2. Assign \( b_2 = b_1 + b_1 = 2 \) (not in the list, so we skip this)
3. Assign \( b_2 = 3 \) (requires at least one variable)
4. Assign \( b_3 = b_1 + b_2 = 4 \)
5. Assign \( b_4 = b_3 + b_1 = 5 \) (again not in list, so we skip)
6. Finally to achieve \( 7 \), we'd need a combination of previously assigned variables.

The expected output for this input is \( 3 \) because we would need three variables to achieve the sums. However, the program would only count the distinct values without considering how the sums could be formed, leading to incorrect behavior. 

Thus, the logic in the code is insufficient, and as such, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
