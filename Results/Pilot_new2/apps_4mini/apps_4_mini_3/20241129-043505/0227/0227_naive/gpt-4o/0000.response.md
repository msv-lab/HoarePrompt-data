To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program logic and see if it satisfies the requirements for all potential cases.

### Problem Analysis
The task involves finding the minimum number of distinct variables `b_i` required to perform a sequence of operations based on the provided distinct integers `a`. The first operation sets the first variable to `a[0]`, and subsequent operations involve sums of the currently assigned variables to reach each `a[i]`.

### Program Analysis
The program does the following:
1. It sorts the array `a`.
2. It initializes a set `assigned` to track assigned values, starting with `a[0]`.
3. For each subsequent value in `a`, it checks if it can be formed by the sum of any two already assigned values in `assigned`.
4. If it cannot be formed, it increments the variable count `m` (representing the number of distinct variables needed) and adds the current `a[i]` to `assigned`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Case where operations cannot be performed:** When the sequence cannot be satisfied with any number of variables (i.e., if the required sum cannot be formed), the program should return `-1`. 

For example:
- Input: `3` (3 6 5)
    - Here, `6` cannot be formed using existing variables from `3` and any other variable since `3 + 3` would be `6` but you can't have two of the same variable. Therefore, the output should be `-1`.
- The program appears to handle this correctly as it checks if the required sum can be formed from existing assigned values.

2. **Case with minimum `n`:** When `n=1`, it should return `1`, since we only need one variable to store `a[0]`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the logic as described in the problem statement and all provided examples return the expected results. 

After reviewing potential cases, I find that the program adheres to the specifications without omitting any edge cases or logic flaws.

Correctness: **True**.
