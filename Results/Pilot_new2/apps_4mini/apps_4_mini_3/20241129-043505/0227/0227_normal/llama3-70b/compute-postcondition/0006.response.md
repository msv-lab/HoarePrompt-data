`m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` was 1, so the new value of `m` is 2. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to double the value of `a[i - 1]`.**
