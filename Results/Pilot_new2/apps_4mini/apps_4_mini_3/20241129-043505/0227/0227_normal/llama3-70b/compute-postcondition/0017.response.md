The function `func` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers (where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `a` and then iterates through the sorted list to count how many numbers are not double the previous number. The variable `m` is initialized to 1, counting the first element as a distinct group. If the count of distinct groups (`m`) exceeds 23, the function returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count `m`. 

Importantly, the function does not handle cases where the input could be invalid (e.g., if `n` does not conform to the expected range or if `a` is not provided correctly). The function relies on user input without input validation, which could lead to issues in execution.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It counts how many distinct groups of integers exist in `a` such that each integer is not twice the previous integer. If the count exceeds 23, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count. It does not validate inputs and may fail if inputs are outside expected ranges. **
