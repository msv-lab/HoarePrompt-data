Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the third element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
