The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` and counts how many integers in `a` cannot form pairs with any previously assigned integers from the list. The function returns this count as `m`. It is important to note that the function inherently handles the scenario where all integers can form pairs, and in such cases, it will return a minimal count of unique integers. However, there are no additional checks for potential edge cases such as the behavior of the function if `n` is 1 or if the integers are at the limits of their range, but the logic will still return correctly under these conditions.
