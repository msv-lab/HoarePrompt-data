According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains all elements from `a` that were checked plus `a[1]`, `i` is 2, `can_form` is False**
