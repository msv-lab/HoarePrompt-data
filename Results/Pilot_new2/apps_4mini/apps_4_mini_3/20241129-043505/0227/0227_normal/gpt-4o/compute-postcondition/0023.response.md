The code updates the `assigned` set by adding the element from list `a` at index `i`. The value of `i` is 1, so the element being added to `assigned` is `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains all elements from `a` that were checked plus `a[1]`, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False.**
