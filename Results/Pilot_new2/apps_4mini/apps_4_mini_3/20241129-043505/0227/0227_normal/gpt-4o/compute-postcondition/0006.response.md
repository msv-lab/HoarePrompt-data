According to the code, the loop iterates over the `assigned` variable. For the loop to execute at least once, the `assigned` variable must contain at least one element. Given that `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, it is implied that `assigned` is not empty as long as `a` is a list of distinct integers, which means `a` must have at least one element (it has at least one because `n` is greater than 1). 

The variable `x` will be assigned the value of the first element in `assigned` during the first iteration. 

Therefore, the necessary states for the loop to execute are:
- `assigned` contains at least one element (which it does, since it contains `a[0]`).
- `x` will take the value of `assigned[0]` (which is `a[0]`).

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `a[0]`**
