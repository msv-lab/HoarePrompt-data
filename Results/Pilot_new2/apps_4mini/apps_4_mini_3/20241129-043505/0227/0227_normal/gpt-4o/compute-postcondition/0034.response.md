Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is a non-empty collection, and `x` is the second element of `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
