Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is a collection with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
