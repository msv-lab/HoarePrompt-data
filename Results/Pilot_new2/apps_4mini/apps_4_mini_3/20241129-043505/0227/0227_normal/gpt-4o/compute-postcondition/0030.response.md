Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is a non-empty collection, and `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
