The code `assigned.add(a[i])` adds the element `a[i]` from the list `a` to the collection `assigned`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `can_form` are not directly affected by this operation. However, the collection `assigned` is updated to include the new element.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated collection `assigned` while keeping the other variable states unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` now includes `a[i]`, `can_form` remains unchanged, and `m` remains unchanged.**
