The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The values of `floor_b` and therefore `time_to_target_floor` are affected by this assignment. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b; block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are assigned values returned by `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)` respectively; `time_to_exit` is 0 if `floor_a` is 1, otherwise `time_to_exit` is equal to `9 + floor_a`; `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; reverse_walk_time` is equal to `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is equal to `min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time); `time_to_target_floor` is equal to `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
