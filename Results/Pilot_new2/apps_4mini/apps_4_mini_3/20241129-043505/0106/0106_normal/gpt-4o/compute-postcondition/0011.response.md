To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the variables involved and their relationships.

1. **Variables at the start**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\).
   - `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(a \neq b\).
   - The values of `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are assigned from the function `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)`.
   - `time_to_exit` is calculated as follows:
     - If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` = 0.
     - Otherwise, `time_to_exit` = \(9 + floor_a\).
   - `direct_walk_time` is calculated as \(|block_a - block_b| \mod n \cdot 15\).
   - `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as \((n - |block_a - block_b|) \mod n \cdot 15\).
   - `min_walk_time` is calculated as \(\min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)\).
   - `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as \((floor_b - 1) \cdot 5\).

2. **Impact of the code**:
   - The variable `total_time` is computed as the sum of the three time components:
     \[
     total\_time = time\_to\_exit + min\_walk\_time + time\_to\_target\_floor
     \]
   - The values of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` are utilized to calculate `total_time`, but they do not change after this operation.

3. **Variables affected**:
   - The only variable explicitly changed (calculated) is `total_time`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` remain as they were, with only `total_time` being newly computed.
   - Therefore, the output state includes all relevant variables and the computed `total_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k), `b` is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b), `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are integers assigned by `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is 0 if `floor_a` is 1 otherwise `time_to_exit` = 9 + `floor_a`, `direct_walk_time` is abs(`block_a` - `block_b`) % `n` * 15, `reverse_walk_time` is (n - abs(`block_a` - `block_b`)) % `n` * 15, `min_walk_time` is min(`direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`), `time_to_target_floor` is (`floor_b` - 1) * 5, `total_time` is calculated as `time_to_exit` + `min_walk_time` + `time_to_target_floor`.**
