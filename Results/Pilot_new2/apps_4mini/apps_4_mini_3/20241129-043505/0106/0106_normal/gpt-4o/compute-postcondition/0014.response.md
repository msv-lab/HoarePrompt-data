Functionality: ** The function accepts positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with integers `a` and `b` representing apartment numbers. It calculates the total time required to exit from apartment `a` to apartment `b`, considering the time to exit the floor of the starting apartment, the minimum walking time between the blocks, and the time to reach the target floor of the destination apartment. The function returns this total time. It handles the scenario where both apartments are on different floors and blocks, and it correctly calculates time based on the given building layout. **
