The program given in the annotated code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Block Number**: 
   - The calculation for `a_block` and `b_block` is incorrect. The formula used `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` is incorrect because the correct formula for determining the block (or подъезд) should be based on the total number of apartments per block, which is `m * k`, not `k`. The correct calculation should be `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` for both `a` and `b`.

2. **Incorrect Time Calculation Logic**: 
   - The time calculations do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the elevator time is not correctly implemented. The elevator time should include the waiting time (10 seconds) plus the travel time for each floor, whether ascending or descending. Though the code adds 10 seconds when moving floors, it does not account for the case where Edward is already on the first floor, which should not incur the elevator wait time.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: 
   - The program does not check if Edward starts on the first floor. If Edward is on the first floor and needs to go to a floor higher than his, the program incorrectly assumes he will incur an elevator wait time. 

4. **Direction Choice**: 
   - The calculation for minimum block time only considers the clockwise direction. The problem states that Edward can choose which direction to go, but the implementation does not account for both directions correctly in the time calculation.

Given these issues, the program cannot guarantee correct results for all inputs as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the output should be:

Correctness: **False**
