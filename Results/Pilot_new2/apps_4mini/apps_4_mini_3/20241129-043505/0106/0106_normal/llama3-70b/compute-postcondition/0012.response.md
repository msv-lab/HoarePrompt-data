Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`; `min_block_time` is equal to min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is equal to (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10; the result of `print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)` is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
