The values of `a` and `b` are assigned from the input values using the `map(int, input().split())`, which takes two integers as input. The previous values of `a` and `b` have not been specified but are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. Therefore, the previous condition still holds. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input values; `a`, `b` are distinct integers assigned from input values satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.**
