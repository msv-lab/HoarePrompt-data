Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where both are between 1 and 10^18. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by every integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during this process, the function prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it relies on user input for `n` and `k`. **
