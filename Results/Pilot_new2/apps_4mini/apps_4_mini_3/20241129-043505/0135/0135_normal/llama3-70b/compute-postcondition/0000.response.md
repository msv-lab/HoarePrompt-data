The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, and since the initial state specifies that both are integers within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), they will be updated according to the input values. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not specified, but the output state will reflect their new values after the input is processed. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18**
