The `exit()` command terminates the program immediately. Therefore, no variables are changed or updated. The values of the variables remain as they were prior to the execution of the command. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` is a set including the values of `remainder` and 0, `i` is 3, `remainder` is `n % 3`, and the output is 'No'.**
