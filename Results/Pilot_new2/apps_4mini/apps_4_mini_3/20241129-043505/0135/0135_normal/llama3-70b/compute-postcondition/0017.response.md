The code executes the print statement which outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables themselves do not change, but this print statement produces an output. Therefore, the output state lists the existing variables along with the output from the print statement. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` is now a set including the values of `remainder` and 0, `i` is 3, `remainder` is `n % 3`, and the output is 'No'.**
