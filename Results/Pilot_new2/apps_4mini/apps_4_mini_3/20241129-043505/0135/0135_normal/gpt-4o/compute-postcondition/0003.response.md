The variable `seen_remainders` is initialized as a new empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the initialization of the `seen_remainders` set while preserving the conditions of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` is an empty set.**
