The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n % 2`, which will yield either 0 or 1, depending on whether `n` is even or odd. The initial state states that if `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the program returns 'No', but since we are adding `remainder` to `seen_remainders`, we will assume that it was not present before this operation. 

Now, after executing the code `seen_remainders.add(remainder)`, the value of `seen_remainders` will be updated to include the `remainder`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is 2, and `seen_remainders` now includes the value of `remainder` (which is `n % 2`).**
