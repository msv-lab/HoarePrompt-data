The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainder from the division of `n` by integers from 1 to `k` has been seen before; otherwise, it returns 'Yes' if all remainders are unique. If `k` is less than `n`, the function checks for unique remainders in the range from 1 to `k`. The conditions where the function may return 'No' are based on the values of both `k` and the remainders seen during the loop.
