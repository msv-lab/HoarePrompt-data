The value of `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue` and that element is removed from `d_queue` as a result of the `pop(0)` operation. The initial conditions state that `d_queue` contains at least one element, so after this operation, `d_queue` will contain one less element. The states of `n`, `votes`, and `r_queue` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `d_queue` contains one less element; `r_queue` must contain at least one element; `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`.**
