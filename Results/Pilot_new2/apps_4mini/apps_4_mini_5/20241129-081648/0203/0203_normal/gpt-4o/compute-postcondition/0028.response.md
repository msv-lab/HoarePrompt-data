In the given code, the first operation is `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)`, which removes the first element from the `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. The `d_queue` will have one less element after this operation, and `d_index` will now hold the value of the removed element. Since we have no prior information about the specific values in `d_queue`, we can describe its state after the operation but cannot provide specific values.

The initial conditions state that `votes` contains at least one 'D' and one 'R', which doesn't affect the operation on `d_queue`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as the operation does not involve it. Lastly, `r_queue` is mentioned to be greater than 0 but is not directly affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `r_queue` must be greater than 0; `d_queue` has one less element, and `d_index` holds the value of the removed first element of `d_queue`.**
