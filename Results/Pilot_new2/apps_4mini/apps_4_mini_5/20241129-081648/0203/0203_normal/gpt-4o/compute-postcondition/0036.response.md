The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to the `d_queue`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, `d_index` must also be a valid integer. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

The output state reflects that `d_queue` will have one additional element, which is the result of `d_index + n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `d_queue` contains one less element and now has an additional element `d_index + n`; `r_queue` has one less element; `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`.**
