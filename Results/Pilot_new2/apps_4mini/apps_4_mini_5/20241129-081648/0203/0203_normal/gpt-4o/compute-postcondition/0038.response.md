Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` contains one less element with an additional element `d_index + n`, and `r_queue` has one less element, with `r_index` being the first element from `r_queue`. Otherwise, `d_queue` contains one less element, `r_queue` has one less element with an additional element `r_index + n`, and `r_index` remains the first element from `r_queue`.***
