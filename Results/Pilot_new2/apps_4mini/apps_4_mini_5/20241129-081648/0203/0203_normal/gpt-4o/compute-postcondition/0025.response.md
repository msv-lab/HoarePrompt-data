The code appends the value `r_index + n` to the `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is equal to the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000. Therefore, `r_queue` will have one additional element equal to `r_index + n`.

The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions about the ranges and contents of the variables are still valid after the execution.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `d_queue` contains one less element than before; `r_queue` now contains one less element than before and one additional element equal to `r_index + n`; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`; `d_index` is the value of the first element in the original `d_queue`; and `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.**
