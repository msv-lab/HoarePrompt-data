The operation `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Given that `r_queue` must not be empty, this operation will successfully retrieve and remove the first element. The initial conditions state that `d_queue` contains one less element than before, but this does not directly affect `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` will be equal to the first element of the original `r_queue`, and after the operation, `r_queue` will contain one less element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `d_queue` contains one less element than before; `r_queue` now contains one less element than before; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`; `d_index` is the value of the first element in the original `d_queue`.**
