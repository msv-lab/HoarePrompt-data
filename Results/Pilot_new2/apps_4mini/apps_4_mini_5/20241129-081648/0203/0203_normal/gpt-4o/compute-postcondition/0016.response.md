The code executes the operation `r_queue.append(i)`, which appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The value of `i` was previously defined as `k + 2`, and since it is being appended to `r_queue`, we can state that `r_queue` will now contain this new value.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000.
- `votes` is a string of length `n`.
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `v` is the character at index `k + 2` in `votes`, provided that `k + 2 < n`.

The output state will reflect that `i` has been added to `r_queue`, while all other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `k + 2`; `v` is the character at index `k + 2` in `votes`; `r_queue` now includes the value `i`.**
