The code initializes `d_queue` as an empty list. The initial state of `n` and `votes` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `votes`, along with the new state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' without leading or trailing whitespace; `d_queue` is an empty list.**
