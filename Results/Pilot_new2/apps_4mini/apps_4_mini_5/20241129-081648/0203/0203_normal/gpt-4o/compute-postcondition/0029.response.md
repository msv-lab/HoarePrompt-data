The variable `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `r_queue`. Since `r_queue` is guaranteed to contain more than one element (as `r_queue` must be greater than 0), after this operation, `r_queue` will have one less element. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `r_queue` has one less element, `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` holds the value of the removed first element of `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.**
