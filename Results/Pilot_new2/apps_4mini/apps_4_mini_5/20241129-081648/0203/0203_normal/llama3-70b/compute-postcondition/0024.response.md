The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a string representing employees. The parameter `n` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The second parameter is a string of length `n`, consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', where 'D' represents an employee from the depublicans fraction and 'R' represents an employee from the remocrats fraction. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specifics of the employee distribution. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a result based on the analysis of these characters.**
