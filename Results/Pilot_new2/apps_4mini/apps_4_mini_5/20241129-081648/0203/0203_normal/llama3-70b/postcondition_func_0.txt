The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. The function prints 'D' if there are more 'D' characters than 'R' characters; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If `n` is outside the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) or if the string contains characters other than 'D' and 'R', the function does not handle these cases, which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors.
