Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is either `n` or `n + k`, and `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n` or `n + k`. If `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains `-1`. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains an additional `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of times `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance` for each `b` in `prefix_balances`, and `results` contains the value of `count`.***
