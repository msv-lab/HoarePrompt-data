The code assigns `x` the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `index` is 1. This means `x` will be assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list (since `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[2]`). The previous constraints on `x` remain valid, but its value will change depending on the contents of `data`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
