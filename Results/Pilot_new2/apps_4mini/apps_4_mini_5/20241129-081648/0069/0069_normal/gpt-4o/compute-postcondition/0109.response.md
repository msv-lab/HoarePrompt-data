Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, and `prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[k]` is the balance computed from the first `k` characters of `s`, with `prefix_balances[n]` equal to `balance + prefix_balances[0]`. If the current value of `balance` is 0 and `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, then `results` is updated to include -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then `results` has an additional entry of 0. Otherwise, if `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is equal to the number of elements `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and the `results` list now includes the value of `count`.***
