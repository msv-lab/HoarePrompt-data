The value of `count` is incremented by 1, which means `count` now equals its previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` must have at least 1 element, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, and `count` is 1 greater than its previous value.
