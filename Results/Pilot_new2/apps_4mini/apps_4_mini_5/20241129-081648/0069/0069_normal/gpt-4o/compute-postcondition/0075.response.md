According to the code, the for loop will execute `T` times, and at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed once. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not affect the logic, but the loop index will increment with each iteration. 

Since `T` is between 1 and 100, if the loop has executed once, we need to check if it can execute again. The state of `T` allows for it to execute again as long as it is greater than the current iteration count.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed once, so for the loop to execute one more time, the remaining iterations would need to be at least 1, meaning `T` must still be greater than 1.

Thus, the next state should indicate that we are now at the second iteration. 

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is either `n` or `n + k`, and `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n` or `n + k`, and the loop has executed twice.**
