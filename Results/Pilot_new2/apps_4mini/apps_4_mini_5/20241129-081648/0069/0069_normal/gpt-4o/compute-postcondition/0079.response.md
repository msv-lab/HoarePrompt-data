The variable `index` is incremented by 3. It affects the previous value of `index`, but the previous value is unknown. The other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `i` is either `n` or `n + k`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n` or `n + k`, `x` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is now `index + 3`.
