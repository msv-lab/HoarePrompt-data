The code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is determined from the initial state as equal to `int(data[n + 1])`. Therefore, `prefix_balances` will be an array of zeros where the length depends on the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 1])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 2])`, `s` is equal to `data[n + 3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is equal to `n + 4`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `_` is equal to `T`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**
