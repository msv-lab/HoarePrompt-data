According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` contains more than 1 value, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 1 value, and `result` is the first element in `results`. To execute the loop one more time, `results` must have at least 2 values, and `result` will then be the second element in the list.

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing at least 2 values, `result` is the second element in `results`**
