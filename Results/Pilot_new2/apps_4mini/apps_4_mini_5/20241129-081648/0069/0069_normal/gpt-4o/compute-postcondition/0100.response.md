Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` must have at least 1 element, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
