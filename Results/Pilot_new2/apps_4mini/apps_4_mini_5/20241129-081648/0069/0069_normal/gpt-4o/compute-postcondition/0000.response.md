The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the built-in `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. This means that instead of using the default input function, `input` will now refer to a method that reads all input from standard input until EOF (End Of File) is reached. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 100, for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, and `s` is a binary string of length `n` containing only characters '0' and '1'. The variable `input` now refers to `sys.stdin.read`.**
