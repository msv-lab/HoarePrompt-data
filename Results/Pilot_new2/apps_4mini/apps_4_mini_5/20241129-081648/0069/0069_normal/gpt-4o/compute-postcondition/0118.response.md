The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it handles multiple test cases based on the constraints provided. The function processes each test case consisting of a positive integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. The function outputs the results for each test case based on the logic defined within. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases involving a positive integer n, an integer x, and a binary string s, returning results based on the conditions defined in the function for each test case.**
