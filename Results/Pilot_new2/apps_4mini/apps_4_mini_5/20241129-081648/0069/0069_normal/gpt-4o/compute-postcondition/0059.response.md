Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n`, `prefix_balances[n]` is equal to `balance`, the current value of `balance` is 0. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains `-1` appended to it. Otherwise, if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains an additional `0`.***
