Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer within the specified range, `s` is a binary string input by the user, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. If `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the printed output is the value of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
