The code `print(n + 1)` will output the value of `n + 1`. The variable `n` is a positive integer input, and since the print statement does not change the value of any variables, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0 but reduced to indicate one less iteration; `n` is a positive integer input; `x` is an input integer within the specified range; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`; and the output displayed is `n + 1`.
