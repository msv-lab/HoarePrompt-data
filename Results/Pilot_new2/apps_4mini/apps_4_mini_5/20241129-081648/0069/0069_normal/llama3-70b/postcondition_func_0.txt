The function accepts a positive integer T representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer n, an integer x, and a binary string s of length n. It counts the number of '0's and '1's in s, calculates the balance as the difference between these counts, and prints results based on the relationship between the balance and x. If the balance equals x, it prints n + 1. If (x - balance) is perfectly divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the integer division of (x - balance) by (cnt0 - cnt1), incremented by 1. If cnt0 equals cnt1, the balance will be 0, and special handling may be needed in those scenarios as division could lead to incorrect results if not addressed.
