Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1. If `balance` equals `x`, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `balance` does not equal `x`, then the program state remains unchanged if `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`; otherwise, the result is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. Meanwhile, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer within the specified range, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1` and remains unchanged.***
