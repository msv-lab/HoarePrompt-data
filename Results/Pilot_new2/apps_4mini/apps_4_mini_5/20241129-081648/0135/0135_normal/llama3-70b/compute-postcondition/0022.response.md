The code outputs 'Yes', but it does not change any variables or their states. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `remainder`, and `seen` remain as they were initially stated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `i` is equal to `k`, `remainder` is equal to `n % k`, `seen` contains the unique remainders of `n % i` for all `i` from 1 to `k` without any duplicates, and the output is 'Yes'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `i` is equal to `k`, `remainder` is equal to `n % k`, `seen` contains the unique remainders of `n % i` for all `i` from 1 to `k` without any duplicates, output is 'Yes'.**
