The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input()`, which are converted to integers. The specific values for `n` and `k` will depend on the user input. However, we know that both `n` and `k` must still satisfy the condition `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18**.
