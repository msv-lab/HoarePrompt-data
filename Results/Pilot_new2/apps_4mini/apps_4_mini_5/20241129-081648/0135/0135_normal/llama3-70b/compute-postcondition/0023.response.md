The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition. However, it is implied that there are external constraints on two integers, `n` and `k`, such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Since the output of the function is not provided, we cannot ascertain the return value based on the given information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described without additional details about its output. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any input parameters and its return value is not specified.**
