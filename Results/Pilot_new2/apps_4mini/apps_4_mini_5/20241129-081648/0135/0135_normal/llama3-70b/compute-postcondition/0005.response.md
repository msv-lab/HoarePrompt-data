The code snippet `print('No')` outputs the string 'No' to the console but does not modify any variable values. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the current value of `remainder` is in the set `seen`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the current value of `remainder` is in the set `seen`**.
