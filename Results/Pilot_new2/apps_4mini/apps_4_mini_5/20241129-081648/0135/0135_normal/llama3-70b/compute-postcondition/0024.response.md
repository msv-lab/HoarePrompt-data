The function `func` accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, which are read from input. It checks if all the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k` are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, after checking all integers, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not explicitly return a value but instead provides output through print statements. Notably, if `k` is very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), the function may encounter performance issues or take a significant amount of time to execute due to the loop, but the functionality does not handle this explicitly. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, checks for duplicates among the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, prints 'No' if a duplicate is found, and prints 'Yes' if all remainders are unique. **
