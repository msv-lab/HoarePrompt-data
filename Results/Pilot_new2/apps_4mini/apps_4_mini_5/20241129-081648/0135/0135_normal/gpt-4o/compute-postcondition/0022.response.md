The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, and they must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If certain conditions regarding the remainder being in a set of seen remainders are met, the function also returns 'No'. Additionally, there are other conditions that will lead to a return of 'No'. Finally, if none of these conditions are satisfied, the function returns 'Yes'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return 'No' under various conditions or 'Yes' if none of those conditions apply. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, both integers. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if specific conditions regarding remainders are met, or due to other conditions. If none of these conditions are satisfied, it returns 'Yes'.**
