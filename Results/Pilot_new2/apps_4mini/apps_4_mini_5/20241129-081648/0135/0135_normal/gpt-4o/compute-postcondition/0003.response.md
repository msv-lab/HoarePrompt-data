The code initializes an empty set named `seen_remainders`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code executed. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the new value of `seen_remainders`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` is an empty set.**
