The code `seen_remainders.add(remainder)` adds `remainder` to the set `seen_remainders`. If `remainder` was previously in `seen_remainders`, no action is taken, but since the instruction implies that it is not in `seen_remainders` when the code runs, it is added. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ `k` < `n`; `remainder` has been added to `seen_remainders`.**
