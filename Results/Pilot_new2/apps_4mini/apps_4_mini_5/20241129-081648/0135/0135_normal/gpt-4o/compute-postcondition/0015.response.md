According to the code, the loop iterates based on the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer less than `n`. Given that the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, we need to adjust `i` to be one more than its current value.

Since the last value of `i` that was executed must be `k`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must still be valid, meaning `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ `k` < `n`, i is k + 1**
