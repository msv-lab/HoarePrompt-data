To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and see if it fulfills the requirements under all scenarios.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of variables \( m \) such that we can perform a sequence of operations where each subsequent operation depends on the values stored in the variables. The operations are defined such that:

1. The first variable is assigned the value of the first element in the sequence.
2. Each subsequent variable assignment must equal a value that can be derived by summing the values of other variables.

The provided program does the following:

1. It reads the integer \( n \) and the sequence \( a \).
2. It sorts the sequence \( a \).
3. It initializes \( m \) to 1, assuming at least one variable is needed.
4. It iterates through the sorted sequence starting from the second element.
5. It increments \( m \) whenever the current element is not double the previous element.
6. Finally, it prints \( m \) if it's less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Misinterpretation of Requirements**: The program assumes that for \( a[i] \) to be formed, it only needs to check if it is double the previous element. However, this is incorrect. The operation needs to verify if any combination of previous variables can sum to form each \( a[i] \). The logic of simply checking if \( a[i] \) is double \( a[i-1] \) is overly simplistic and does not account for all possible combinations that could be required.

2. **Example Where It Fails**: 
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     1 2 3
     ```
   - According to the problem description, we should be able to assign \( b_1 = 1 \), then \( b_2 = b_1 + b_1 = 2 \), and finally to get 3, we could do \( b_1 = b_1 + b_2 \) to achieve \( b_1 = 3 \). 
   - Here, we can achieve all required values using just 2 variables, \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \). 
   - However, if the array were to contain elements that cannot be formed by summing previous variables, the current logic would not be able to handle it as it only looks for doubling.

3. **Output for Invalid Cases**: The program does not appropriately assess if it is possible to perform the operations under the constraint of having \( m \) variables. It only increases \( m \) based on the doubling condition, which can lead to incorrect conclusions.

Given these flaws, the program does not accurately determine the minimum number of variables needed in every potential case. It fails to consider necessary combinations and fails for inputs that do not meet its simplistic conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not accurately implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. It oversimplifies the conditions under which variable assignments can be made and does not handle all possible configurations that might be required.
