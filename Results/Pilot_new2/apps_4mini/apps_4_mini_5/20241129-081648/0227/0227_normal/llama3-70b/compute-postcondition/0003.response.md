The variable `m` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this operation. Hence, the Output State retains the original information about `n` and `a`, while updating `m` to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers; `m` is 1.**
