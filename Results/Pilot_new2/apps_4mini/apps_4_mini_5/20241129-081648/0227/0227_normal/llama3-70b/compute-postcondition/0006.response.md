The value of `m` is incremented by 1. Since `m` was initially 1, its new value will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `m` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 2.**
