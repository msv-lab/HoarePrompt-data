The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split string, which represents `n` distinct positive integers. The previous state of `n` ensures that `a` will contain exactly `n` distinct integers in the range 1 to 10^9. Therefore, `a` will now be a list of these integers based on the user input. The state of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers input by the user.**
