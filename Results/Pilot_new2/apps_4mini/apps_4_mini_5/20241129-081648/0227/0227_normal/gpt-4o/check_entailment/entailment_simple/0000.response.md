To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation in the function `func_1`.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum number of variables `m` such that a sequence of operations can be performed. The operations consist of assigning the first integer in the sequence to a variable and subsequent integers must be created by summing the values in any two of the previously assigned variables.

### Implementation Review:
1. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of integers `a`. This is a reasonable step because it allows the program to handle the smallest values first, which may help in forming larger sums from smaller ones.
  
2. **Assigned Set**: The program maintains a set called `assigned` to keep track of which values have been successfully assigned to the variables.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - It starts by adding the first value `a[0]` to the `assigned` set and initializes `m` to 1.
   - For each subsequent value `a[i]`, it checks whether it can be formed by summing any two distinct values from the `assigned` set.
   - If `a[i]` cannot be formed, it increments `m` (indicating that we need an additional variable) and adds `a[i]` to `assigned`.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns `m`, which represents the minimum number of variables needed.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The algorithm correctly identifies when a new variable is needed. It checks combinations of previously assigned values to see if the next value can be formed.
- However, the algorithm does not actually attempt to compute valid sums. It only checks if the difference between `a[i]` and any value in `assigned` exists within `assigned`. This logic may fail to find valid combinations of sums and could incorrectly increment `m`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:

```
3
3 6 5
```

- Expected output is `-1` because it is not possible to form `5` from `3` and `6` (the only previous elements) using the sum of two distinct variables.
- The function would incorrectly identify `5` as a new variable, incrementing `m` to `2` and returning `2`, which does not satisfy the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. It does not accurately verify whether the current number can be formed by summing any two previous numbers, leading to potentially incorrect increments of `m`.

Correctness: **False**
