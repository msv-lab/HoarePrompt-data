The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty set containing elements from the list `a`, `m` is unchanged, `can_form` is True, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element of the set `assigned`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty set containing elements from the list `a`, `m` is unchanged, `can_form` is True, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element of the set `assigned`.**
