The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty set containing at least one element, `x` is the next element in the set `assigned`, `can_form` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
