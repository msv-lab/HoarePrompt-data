The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty set containing at least one additional element, `x` is the next element in the set `assigned`, and `can_form` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty set containing at least one additional element, `x` is the next element in the set `assigned`, `can_form` is `True**.
