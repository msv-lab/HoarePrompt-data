The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and the parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. After executing the function, it returns the count of unique forms that are unable to be created from the elements of the set 'assigned', which is represented by 'm'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers, and it returns the count of unique forms that cannot be created from the elements of the set 'assigned' represented by 'm'.**
