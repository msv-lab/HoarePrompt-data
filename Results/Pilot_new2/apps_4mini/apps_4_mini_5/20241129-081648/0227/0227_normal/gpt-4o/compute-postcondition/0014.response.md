Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is a set containing at least one element, `m` is 1, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[k]` ≤ 10^9. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
