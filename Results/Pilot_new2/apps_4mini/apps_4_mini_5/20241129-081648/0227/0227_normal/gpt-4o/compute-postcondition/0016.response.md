The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect any previously defined variables, so all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is a set containing at least one more element, `m` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[k]` ≤ 10^9, `can_form` is True**
