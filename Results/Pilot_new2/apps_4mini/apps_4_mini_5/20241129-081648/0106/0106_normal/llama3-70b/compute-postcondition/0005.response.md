The variable `b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, and `b_floor` remain unchanged. The value of `b_block` is calculated based on the values of `b`, `m`, and `k`, and since `b` is a positive integer, `b_block` will also be a positive integer.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an integer equal to the first input value; `b` is an integer equal to the second input value; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
