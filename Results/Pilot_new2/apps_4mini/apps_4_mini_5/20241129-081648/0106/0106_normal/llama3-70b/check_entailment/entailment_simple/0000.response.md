To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Breakdown of the Problem Description

1. **Understanding the Inputs:**
   - `n`: Number of entrances.
   - `m`: Number of floors per entrance.
   - `k`: Number of apartments per floor.
   - `a`: Apartment number of Edward.
   - `b`: Apartment number of Natasha.

2. **Apartment Numbering:**
   - Apartments are numbered starting from 1 up to \( n \cdot m \cdot k \).
   - The first apartment in an entrance is on the first floor, and the last apartment in the building is \( n \cdot m \cdot k \).

3. **Movement Costs:**
   - Moving vertically (up or down one floor) takes 5 seconds.
   - Moving horizontally (from one entrance to the next) takes 15 seconds.
   - The elevator arrives in 10 seconds and takes 1 second per floor.

### Breakdown of the Program Logic

1. **Calculate Floors and Entrances:**
   - The program calculates the floor and entrance (block) of both Edward (`a`) and Natasha (`b`) using integer arithmetic:
     ```python
     a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
     b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```

2. **Horizontal Movement Time Calculation:**
   - It calculates the minimum time required to move between entrances (blocks):
     ```python
     min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
     ```
   - This accounts for the circular nature of the building.

3. **Vertical Movement Time Calculation:**
   - The program decides whether to go up or down based on the floors:
     ```python
     if (a_floor > b_floor):
         min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
     else:
         min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
     ```
   - This also considers the elevator wait time if it is used.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Finally, it sums up the times and prints the result:
     ```python
     print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
     ```

### Analysis of the Program's Correctness

The program logically follows the steps needed to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha, as outlined in the problem description:

- It accurately calculates the entrance (block) and floor for both Edward and Natasha.
- It considers both horizontal and vertical movements and uses the correct time costs associated with each type of movement.
- The calculation of the minimum time in both horizontal (entrances) and vertical (floors) movement accounts for all specifics mentioned, including elevator usage.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the entire logic of the program against the problem description, it is evident that the program correctly implements the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
