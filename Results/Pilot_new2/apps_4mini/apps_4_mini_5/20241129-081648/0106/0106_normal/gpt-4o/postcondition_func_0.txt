The function accepts three positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k` with `a ≠ b`. It calculates the total time required to exit from the floor of location `a` to the floor of location `b`, which includes the time to exit the current floor if not on the ground floor, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time taken to reach the target floor. The function returns this total time as an integer.
