The code assigns a value to `floor_within_block` based on the expression `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unaffected, while `block` depends on `apartment`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. However, since `block` is defined in terms of `apartment`, its value is still relevant.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.**
