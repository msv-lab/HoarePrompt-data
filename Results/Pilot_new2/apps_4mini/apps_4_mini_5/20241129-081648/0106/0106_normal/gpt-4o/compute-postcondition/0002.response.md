The `floor` variable is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The `floor_within_block` is previously defined as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. Therefore, the value of `floor` is calculated based on the value of `floor_within_block` divided by `k` and incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`; `floor` is equal to `floor_within_block // k + 1`.**
