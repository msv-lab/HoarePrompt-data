To calculate the value of `block`, we need to understand how the code impacts the current state. The `apartment` variable is not defined in the initial state, but we know that `a` and `b` are integers within the specified range. The formula calculates the block number based on the apartment number.

Given this formula:
```
block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```
The above expression will yield the block number based on the value of `apartment`, which must be defined. 

Since we do not have a specific value for `apartment`, we can only express `block` in terms of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, as well as the constraints on `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
