According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. The loop will continue executing as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l` (the starting point of the range). Since `l` is less than or equal to `r`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Given that the loop variable `num` starts from `l` and continues until it reaches `r`, the next value of `num` will be `l + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `num` must still be less than or equal to `r`, which will be the case if `l + 1` is less than or equal to `r`.

Thus, the updated states need to reflect that `num` is now `l + 1`, and `total_sum` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop iteration. The conditions for `l` and `r` remain the same since they define the range.

State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is equal to `l % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 1` if `l + 1 <= r`**
