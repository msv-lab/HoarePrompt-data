To analyze the correctness of the annotated program against the provided problem description, we need to evaluate whether the program correctly computes the sum of numbers between two integers \( l \) and \( r \) that contain at most \( k \) different digits, and returns that sum modulo \( 998244353 \).

### Breakdown of the Program

1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function computes the sum by using a helper function `count`:
     - It calculates the difference between the counts of valid numbers up to \( r \) and valid numbers up to \( l-1 \), which would give the count of valid numbers in the range \([l, r]\).
     - The output is taken modulo \( 998244353 \).

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - This function is supposed to count how many numbers from \( 0 \) to \( n \) contain at most \( k \) different digits.
   - If \( n < 10^k \), it returns \( n \) directly.
   - If \( n \) is larger, it performs calculations to count valid numbers based on the number of digits and the constraints given by \( k \).
   - It utilizes memoization through the `dp` dictionary to avoid recalculating results for the same parameters.

### Evaluation Against The Problem Description

The problem requires:
- Counting only those numbers which contain at most \( k \) different digits between \( l \) and \( r \) (inclusive).
- Returning the sum of these numbers, not just the count of those numbers.
- Ensuring the calculation handles large numbers efficiently.
- Finally, the result should be taken modulo \( 998244353 \).

### Issues Identified
1. **Counting vs. Summing**:
   - The `count` function seems to return a count of how many numbers meet the criteria but does not directly compute their sum.
   - The function `func_1` subtracts two counts and applies a modulus but does not sum the actual numbers that meet the definition given in the problem description.

2. **Missing Sum Calculation**:
   - The problem description explicitly asks for the sum of the numbers, whereas the program only counts the valid numbers.
   - There is no implementation of summing the actual numbers from \( l \) to \( r \) that satisfy the condition of having at most \( k \) different digits.

### Conclusion

The annotated program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description since it does not compute the required sum of valid numbers but rather provides a count of valid numbers. This fundamental misunderstanding of the task leads to an incorrect implementation.

Correctness: **False**
