Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers satisfying -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, then "YES" is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, "NO" is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, then if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
