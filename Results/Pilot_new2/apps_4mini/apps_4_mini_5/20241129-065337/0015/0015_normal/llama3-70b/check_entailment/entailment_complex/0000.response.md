Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input, which aligns with the problem's requirement for these values.

2. **Zero Difference Case (c == 0)**:
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence becomes a constant sequence where all elements are equal to `a`. The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it outputs "YES", indicating that `b` appears in the sequence. If they are not equal, it outputs "NO". This is correct according to the problem description, as the only way for `b` to appear in the sequence in this case is if `b` is equal to `a`.

3. **Non-Zero Difference Case (c != 0)**:
   - When `c` is not zero, the program checks two conditions:
     - It verifies if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`. This checks if `b` can be reached by starting at `a` and repeatedly adding `c`, which is a requirement for `b` to appear in the sequence.
     - It also checks if `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, ensuring that we are counting forward in the sequence (i.e., we are not trying to reach `b` from a smaller value if `c` is negative).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it outputs "YES", indicating that `b` does appear in the sequence. If either condition fails, it outputs "NO". This logic correctly implements the mathematical properties of the arithmetic sequence defined in the problem description.

4. **Correctness Across All Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases as specified in the problem description, including cases where `c` is zero and where it is positive or negative. It also respects the potential value ranges for `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring that there are no overflows or logical errors.

Therefore, the program successfully meets the problem's requirements for all possible inputs, correctly determining if `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`.
