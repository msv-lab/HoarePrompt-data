The code executes a print statement, which does not change any variable values or states, but outputs the string 'YES'. The initial conditions regarding `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged since no variables are modified.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers satisfying -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is not equal to 0, the current value of `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`, and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; output is 'YES'**.
