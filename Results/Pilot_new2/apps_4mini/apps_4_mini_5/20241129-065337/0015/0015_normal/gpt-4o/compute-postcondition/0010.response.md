The code `print('NO')` outputs the string `'NO'` to the console. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State includes the existing conditions along with the fact that `'NO'` has been printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from input, with `-10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`, `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is not equal to 0. The expression `((b - a) % c != 0)` or `((b - a) / c < 0)` holds true; 'NO' has been printed.**
