The `print` statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. The values of variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Since the current value of `b` is equal to the current value of `a`, we maintain that relationship in the output state.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from input, with `-10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`; the current value of `b` is equal to the current value of `a`; and 'YES' is printed to the console.**
