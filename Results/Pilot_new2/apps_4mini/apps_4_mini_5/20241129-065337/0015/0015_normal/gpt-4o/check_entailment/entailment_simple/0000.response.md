To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the functionality of the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The sequence starts with an integer `a`.
2. Each subsequent integer in the sequence increases by `c`.
3. We need to check if the integer `b` appears in this sequence.
4. Output "YES" if `b` appears in the sequence, otherwise output "NO".

### Program Logic Analysis:
- First, it checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If so, it prints "YES".
- If `b` is not equal to `a`, it further checks:
  - If `c` is 0, it prints "NO" because the sequence would remain constant as `a` and not include `b` unless `a` is `b`.
  - If `c` is not 0, it checks whether `(b - a) % c == 0` and whether `(b - a) / c >= 0`. 
    - The first condition checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by the steps of `c` (i.e., if `b` is reachable).
    - The second condition ensures that the number of steps taken (i.e., `(b - a) / c`) is non-negative, meaning `b` is not behind `a` in the sequence.

### Edge Cases:
1. When `c = 0`:
   - If `a = b`, "YES" is printed, which is correct.
   - If `a â‰  b`, "NO" is printed, which is also correct since the sequence does not change.
   
2. When `c > 0`:
   - If `b < a`, it rightly prints "NO" because the sequence only increases.
   - If `b >= a`, it correctly checks whether `b` can be reached by the step size `c`.

3. When `c < 0`:
   - It checks if `b` is reachable (same logic as above applies, but the direction of the sequence is decreasing, which is not explicitly mentioned in the edge case checks). The conditions still hold, and it correctly shows whether `b` is in the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program effectively implements the logic required to determine if `b` appears in the sequence starting from `a` with a difference of `c`. The program accounts for all relevant cases, ensuring it handles constant sequences, increasing sequences, and decreasing sequences appropriately.

Thus, the program is correct as it adheres to the problem description and covers all cases accurately.

Correctness: **True**
