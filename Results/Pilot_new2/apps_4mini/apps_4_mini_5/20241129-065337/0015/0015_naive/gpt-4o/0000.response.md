To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles different scenarios based on the inputs a, b, and c.

### Problem Analysis:
The sequence is defined as follows:
- The first element is `s1 = a`.
- The difference between neighboring elements is `c`, so the sequence can be expressed as:
  - `s1 = a`
  - `s2 = a + c`
  - `s3 = a + 2c`
  - and so on...

The task is to determine if a given integer `b` appears in this sequence, which can be generalized to finding if the equation:
\[ b = a + nc \]
has a solution for some non-negative integer \( n \). This can be rearranged to:
\[ (b - a) = nc \]
From this, we get:
1. If \( c = 0 \):
   - The sequence is constant (all terms are equal to `a`), hence we check if \( b = a \).
2. If \( c \neq 0 \):
   - We need \( (b - a) \% c == 0 \) (to ensure `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`).
   - Additionally, \( (b - a) / c \) must be non-negative to ensure we are not going backwards in the sequence.

### Program Logic:
1. The program first checks if `b` equals `a`. If so, it prints "YES".
2. Then it checks if `c` is zero. If `c` is zero and `b` isn't equal to `a`, it prints "NO".
3. For non-zero `c`, it checks if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of the division is non-negative to print "YES" or "NO".

### Test Cases:
1. For the input `1 7 3`:
   - Valid, outputs "YES".
2. For the input `10 10 0`:
   - Valid, outputs "YES".
3. For the input `1 -4 5`:
   - Valid, outputs "NO".
4. For the input `0 60 50`:
   - Valid, outputs "NO".

### Edge Case:
Now let's consider a potential edge case:
- Input: `5 10 0`
  - Here, `c` is zero, thus the sequence is constant at `5`. The output should be "NO", but according to the program, it will print "NO" correctly.
  
- Input: `1 1 0`
  - The output should be "YES", and it is handled correctly. 

- Input: `5 10 5`
  - In this case, `(b - a) = 5`, which is divisible by `c (5)`, and the result of `(b - a) / c` is `1`, which is non-negative. Output is "YES".

The program correctly checks these conditions and produces the expected results for the defined inputs.

### Conclusion:
After examining the code and considering various scenarios and edge cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all possible cases as described in the problem. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
