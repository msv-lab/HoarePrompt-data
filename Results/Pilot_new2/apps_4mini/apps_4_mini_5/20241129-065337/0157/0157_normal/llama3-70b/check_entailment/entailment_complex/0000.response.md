To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, letâ€™s analyze both step by step.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The program must determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make a compote, adhering to the ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively. For every complete set:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

Thus, the total number of fruits used for `n` sets is:
\[ \text{Total Fruits} = n \times (1 + 2 + 4) = n \times 7 \]
Where `n` is the maximum number of complete sets that can be formed given the available fruits.

### Program Analysis:
The program performs the following operations:

1. It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively.
2. It calculates `min_lemon`, which represents the number of complete sets that can be formed:
   \[
   \text{min\_lemon} = \min(a, \frac{b}{2}, \frac{c}{4})
   \]
   This line ensures that the number of complete sets does not exceed the available count of any fruit type based on the required ratios.
3. Finally, it calculates and prints the total number of fruits:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{min\_lemon} + \text{min\_lemon} \times 2 + \text{min\_lemon} \times 4 = \text{min\_lemon} \times 7
   \]
   This correctly computes the total fruits used based on the number of complete sets.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
- The function correctly identifies how many complete sets of fruit can be made based on the ratios.
- It correctly calculates the total number of fruits used based on the number of complete sets.
- It handles the case where no complete sets can be formed (if `min_lemon` is 0, the result will also be 0).

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description for all possible input scenarios. It correctly computes the maximum total number of fruits used in the compote based on the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
