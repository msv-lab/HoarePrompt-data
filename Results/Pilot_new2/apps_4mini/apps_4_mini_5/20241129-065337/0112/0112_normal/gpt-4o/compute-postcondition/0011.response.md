The value of `i` is assigned as `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. The list `used_cubes` is initialized to `[True] + [False] * (n-1)`, meaning that at the start, the first element is `True` and all subsequent elements up to `n-1` are `False`. When `used_cubes[i] = True` is executed, it sets the `i`-th index of `used_cubes` to `True`. 

Since `i` equals `n`, we will be setting the `n`-th index of `used_cubes` to `True`. This means that after executing the code, `used_cubes[n]` will be `True`, and the previous value for `used_cubes[n]` would have been `False`, given the initialization. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `used_cubes`, `digits`, and `found`) remain unchanged except for the specified index in `used_cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values with the last element set to True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` remains unchanged, and `i` is `n`.**
