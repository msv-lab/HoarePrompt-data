According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` iterable. If there are more digits to process, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is True, indicating that `digit` was found in at least one of the `cube_faces`. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. 

Since `digit` is taken from `digits`, we need to determine the state of the loop for the next iteration. The `digit` for the next iteration will be the next element in the `digits` iterable. Consequently, if we denote the current `digit` as the last one processed in the previous iteration, the next `digit` will be the subsequent one in the iterable.

If `digits` has more elements, we need to consider that `found` may still be True after processing the new `digit`, and `used_cubes` will depend on whether that new `digit` is present in the corresponding `cube_faces`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to reflect the next `digit` from the iterable and ensure that `used_cubes` is either still indicating the previous state or updated based on the new `digit`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values indicating which cubes have been used based on the presence of the next `digit` in the respective `cube_faces`, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, and `found` remains True**
