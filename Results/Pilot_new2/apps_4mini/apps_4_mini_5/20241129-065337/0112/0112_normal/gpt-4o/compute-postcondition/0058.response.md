Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2 if `i` is 1 or greater than 3 if `i` is 2; `used_cubes` at index `i` is set to `True`; `found` is True; `i` is 2 or 3; `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits. If `used_cubes[i]` is `False` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
