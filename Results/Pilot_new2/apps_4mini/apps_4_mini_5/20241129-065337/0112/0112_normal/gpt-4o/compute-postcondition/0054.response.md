According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `n` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. If `i` is 1, then for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. 
2. If `i` is 2, then for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

Given that `used_cubes[i]` has been set to `True`, and `found` remains `True`, these states do not change as they are dependent on the previous iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect the new value of `i` and the requirement for `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2 if `i` is 1 or greater than 3 if `i` is 2, `used_cubes` at index `i` is set to `True`, `found` is True, `i` is 2 or 3, and `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits.**
