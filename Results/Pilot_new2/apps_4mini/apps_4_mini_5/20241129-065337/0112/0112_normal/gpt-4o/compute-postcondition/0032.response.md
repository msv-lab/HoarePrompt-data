According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, which means the loop can execute again as `i` is less than `n`. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` will be 1 after the increment).

Additionally, `used_cubes[i]` is currently True, which means that it will not affect the ability of the loop to continue executing, and `digit` will refer to the element in `cube_faces[i]` based on the updated index.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is now True, `i` is 1, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]`**
