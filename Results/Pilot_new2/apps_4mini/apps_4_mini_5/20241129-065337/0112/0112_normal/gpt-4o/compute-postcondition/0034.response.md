The value of `found` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since `found` is already `True` in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is True, `i` is 1, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]**
