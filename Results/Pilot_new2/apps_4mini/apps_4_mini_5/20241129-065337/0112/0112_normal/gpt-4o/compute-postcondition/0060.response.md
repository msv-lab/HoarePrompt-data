The statement `used_cubes[i] = True` assigns the value `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. The initial conditions state that `used_cubes` at index `i` is already set to `True`, so there is no change in the state of `used_cubes`. Other variables remain unaffected, and we retain the existing conditions regarding `n`, `found`, and `digits`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3 if `i` is 2 or greater than 4 if `i` is 3; `used_cubes` at index `i` is still set to True; `found` is True; `i` is 3 or 4; `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits.**
