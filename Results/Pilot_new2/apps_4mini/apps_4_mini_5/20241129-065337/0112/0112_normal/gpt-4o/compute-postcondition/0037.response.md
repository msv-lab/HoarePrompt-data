According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the loop can execute once more if `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. To allow for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]`**
