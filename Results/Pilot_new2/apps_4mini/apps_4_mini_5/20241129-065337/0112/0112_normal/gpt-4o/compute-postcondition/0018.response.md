The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[n]` is True, `used_cubes[i]` is now True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` is True, `i` is the next value (1 if it was 0, 2 if it was 1, or 3 if it was 2), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
