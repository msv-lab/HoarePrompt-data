Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values where `used_cubes[n]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` remains unchanged, and if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[n]` and `used_cubes[n]` is False, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
