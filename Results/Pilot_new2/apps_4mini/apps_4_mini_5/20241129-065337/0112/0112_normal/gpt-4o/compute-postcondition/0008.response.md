The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to [True] + [False] * (n-1), `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` is True, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
