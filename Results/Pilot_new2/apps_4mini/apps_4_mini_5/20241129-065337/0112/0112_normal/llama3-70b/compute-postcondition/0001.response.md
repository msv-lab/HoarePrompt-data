`cubes` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the input split into integers, and this process is repeated `n` times. Given that `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the value of `cubes` will be a list containing `n` inner lists, each populated with integers based on user input. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from input.**
