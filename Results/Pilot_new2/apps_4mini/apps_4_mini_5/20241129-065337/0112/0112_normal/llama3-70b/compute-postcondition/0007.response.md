According to the code, the loop iterates through each `cube` in the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be an additional `cube` to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and since `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, it must contain at least 3 lists for the loop to iterate again. In that case, `cube` would be updated to the third list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list containing at least 3 lists of integers, `digits` is updated to include the string representations of the integers in `cube`, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`**
