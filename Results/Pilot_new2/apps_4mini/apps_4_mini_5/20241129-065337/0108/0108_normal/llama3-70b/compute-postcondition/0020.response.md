The value of `s` is updated by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with its next character, which is calculated as `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. Additionally, `res` is updated to include `char`. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`s` must include the new value of `char` (which is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`), `res` is updated to include `char`.**
