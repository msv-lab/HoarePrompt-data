The code `s = s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)` replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that follows `char` in the ASCII table. Since `s` must contain at least 2 occurrences of `char`, it will still contain at least 1 occurrence after the replacement. The variable `res` is not affected by this operation.

The output will reflect that `s` now has one occurrence of `char` replaced and that it still contains at least one occurrence of the original `char`.

Output State: **`s` must have contained at least 1 occurrence of the character following `char`, `s` must contain at least 1 occurrence of `char`, `res` includes at least one more occurrence of `char`.**
