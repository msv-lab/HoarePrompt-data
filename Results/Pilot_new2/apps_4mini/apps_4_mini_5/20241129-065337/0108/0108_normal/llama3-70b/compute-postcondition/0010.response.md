According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the contents of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains 'c' and `char` is 'b'. Since 'b' is not in 'c', the loop cannot execute one more time as it currently stands. For the loop to execute again, `s` must include 'b'.

State: **`s` must contain 'b'**
