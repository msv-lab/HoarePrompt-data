To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the `while` loop condition `char in s`.

The loop will execute as long as `char` is present in the string `s`. Given that `s` is currently empty, it cannot contain any characters, meaning that `char` cannot be in `s` at this moment. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `s` contains at least one character, specifically `char`.

To achieve this, we need to modify the state of `s` so that it includes `char`. Since `res` contains characters from 'a' to the maximum character present in the original `s`, one possible adjustment would be to add `char` to `s`.

State: **`s` must contain `char`**.
