According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. The loop will execute if `char` is found within the string `s`. Right before the loop, `char` is 'a', and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. For the loop to execute at least once, the string `s` must contain the character 'a'. Therefore, `s` needs to include 'a' at least once for the loop to proceed.

State: **`s` must contain the character 'a'**
