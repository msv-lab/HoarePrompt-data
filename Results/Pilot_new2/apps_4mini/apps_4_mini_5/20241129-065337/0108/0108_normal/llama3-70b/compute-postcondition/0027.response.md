The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `char`. The initial state states that `s` must contain `char`, but does not provide specific values for `res` or `char`. Therefore, the output will note that `res` has been updated with the addition of `char`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`, `res` is updated to include `char`.**
