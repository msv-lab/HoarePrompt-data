The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial states of the variables indicate that `j` must be less than `target_len`, and since `j` is being incremented, it will now be one unit greater than its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than `i`; `j` is now greater than its previous value and still less than `target_len`.**
