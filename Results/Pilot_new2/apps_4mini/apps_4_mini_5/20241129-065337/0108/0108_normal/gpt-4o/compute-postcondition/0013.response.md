According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, and `j`. The loop can execute again if both `i` is less than `len(s)` and `j` is less than `target_len`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with a length greater than `i + 1`, which means `i` is currently less than `len(s)`. Additionally, since `j` has been incremented and remains less than `target_len`, both conditions for the loop to execute again are satisfied.

Since the loop can execute one more time, there are no adjustments needed to the state.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than `i + 1`; `i` is less than `len(s)`; `j` is less than `target_len`**
