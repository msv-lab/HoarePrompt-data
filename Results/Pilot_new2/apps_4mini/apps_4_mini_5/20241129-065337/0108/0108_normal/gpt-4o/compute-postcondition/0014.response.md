The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is specified that `j` is less than `target_len`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than `i + 1`; `i` is less than `len(s)`; `j` is now greater than its previous value and less than `target_len`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than `i + 1`; `i` is less than `len(s)`; `j` is now greater than its previous value and less than `target_len`.**
