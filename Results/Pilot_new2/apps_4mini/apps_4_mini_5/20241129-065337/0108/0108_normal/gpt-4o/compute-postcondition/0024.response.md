The function `func` reads a string `s` from input, which consists solely of lowercase English letters and has a length between 1 and 100,000. It then checks whether the string `s` contains all the letters of the English alphabet in the correct order. If it finds all letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', otherwise, it prints -1. Importantly, the function does not return any value; it only outputs results to the console.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` of lowercase English letters and outputs 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' if `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order; otherwise, it prints -1. **
