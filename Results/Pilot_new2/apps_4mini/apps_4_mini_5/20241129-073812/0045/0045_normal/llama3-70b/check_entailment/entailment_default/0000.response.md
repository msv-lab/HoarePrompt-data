To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and examine the code.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers such that their sum equals `n` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers in the sequence is maximized. If no such sequence exists, it should return -1.

**Analyzing the Code:**
```
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    seq = []
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if n >= i:
            seq.append(i)
            n -= i
        else:
            break
    if len(seq) != k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, seq)))
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Initial Check**: The code checks if `n < k`, which is a valid check since it's impossible to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers if `n` is less than `k`. If true, it prints `-1`.
   
2. **Building the Sequence**: It initializes an empty list `seq` and enters a loop to add integers from `1` to `k`:
   - It appends `i` to `seq` and subtracts `i` from `n` if `n >= i`.
   - If `n` is less than `i`, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Final Check**: After populating the sequence, it checks if the length of `seq` is equal to `k`. If not, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the sequence.

**Edge Cases Considered:**
- The program does not consider cases where `n` can be exactly equal to `k * (k + 1) / 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` positive integers. In such cases, while the sequence exists, the GCD may not be maximized as required by the problem description.
  
- For example, when `n = 6` and `k = 3`, the program prints `1 2 3`, which is correct. However, for `n = 10` and `k = 3`, it would output `1 2 3` (sum = 6) and fail to generate the correct sequence since `10` can also be represented as `1 2 7` or `1 3 6` which maintains the sum but does not maximize GCD.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints refer to a function for calculating GCD but do not provide any additional context to confirm the correctness of the main logic in generating the sequence. 

**Conclusion:**
The core issue lies in the fact that while the program generates a strictly increasing sequence whose sum is equal to `n`, it does not ensure that the GCD of the numbers is maximized, which is a critical requirement of the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example of Incorrect Behavior:**
For inputs `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program may output `1 2 3`, which sums to `6` and does not fulfill the requirement of yielding 3 numbers that sum to `10`. The correct output could be `1 2 7` or any other sequence summing to `10` while maximizing the GCD.
