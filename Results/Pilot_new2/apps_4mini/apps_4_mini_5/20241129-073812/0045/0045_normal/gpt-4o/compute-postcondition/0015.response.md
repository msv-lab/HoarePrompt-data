Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`. If the remainder is equal to 0, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to `(n - d * min_sum) - 1`, and the sequence is equal to `[d * (1), d * (2), ..., d * (k-1), d * (k) + 1]`, with `i` equal to `k - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
