The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` have specific conditions but does not directly mention the value of `sequence[i]`. Therefore, we recognize that the state of the other variables is not affected, so the output state will reflect the increment operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`; `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.**
