The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and we still break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to `(n - d * min_sum) - 2`, `sequence` is equal to `[d * (1), d * (2), ..., d * (k-2) + 1, d * (k-1), d * (k) + 1]`, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
