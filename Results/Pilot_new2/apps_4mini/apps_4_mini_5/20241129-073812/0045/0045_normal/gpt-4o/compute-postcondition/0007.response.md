According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, which means `i` will take values from `k - 1` to `0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least `1`. Given that `k` is a positive integer, this condition is inherently satisfied.

Before the loop starts:
- `n` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints.
- `k` is also a positive integer, thus `k - 1` is non-negative and equal to or greater than `0`.
- The variable `sequence` is defined but is not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to `k - 1`, which is the initial value of the loop control variable `i`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:
- `k` must be at least `1` (which it already is, as stated).
- `i` starts at `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is equal to `[d * (1), d * (2), ..., d * (k)], i is k - 1`**.
