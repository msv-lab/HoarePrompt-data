Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is equal to `[d * (1), d * (2), ..., d * (k)]`, `i` is k - 1, and if the `remainder` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
