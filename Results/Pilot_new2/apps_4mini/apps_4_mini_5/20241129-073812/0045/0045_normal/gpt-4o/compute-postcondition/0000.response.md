In the code, `min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The variables `n` and `k` are both positive integers, and since `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` will be the sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is a definite value based on the input of `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`.**
