The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. The initial conditions provide that `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and since `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the value of `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`. 

The output state will include the updated value of `remainder`, which is calculated based on the provided values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`; `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`; `remainder` is equal to `n - d * min_sum`.**
