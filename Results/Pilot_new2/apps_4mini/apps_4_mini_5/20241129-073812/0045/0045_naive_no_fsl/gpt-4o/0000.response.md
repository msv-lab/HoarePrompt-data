To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires generating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and has the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Breakdown of the Program Logic:

1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   - The program first calculates the minimum sum required for `k` positive integers, which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This accounts for the smallest possible strictly increasing sequence (1, 2, ..., k).

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - If `min_sum > n`, the program returns `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to create such a sequence. This part is correct.

3. **Finding the Common Factor**:
   - The program calculates `d`, the maximum possible integer such that the entire sequence can be scaled by it, using `d = n // min_sum`.

4. **Remainder Handling**:
   - It calculates the `remainder`, which is the difference between `n` and the sum of the scaled sequence. The program then attempts to distribute this remainder back into the sequence in a way that keeps it strictly increasing.

### Potential Edge Cases:

Let's consider if there are cases where the program might fail in terms of producing a valid sequence:

1. **Case When `k > n`**:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to form `k` positive integers that sum to `n`. The program returns `-1` correctly in this case.

2. **Exact Minimum Case**:
   - If `n` equals `min_sum`, the sequence must be exactly `[1, 2, ..., k]`. The program correctly generates this sequence.

3. **Handling the Remainder**:
   - If the remainder is non-zero and can be distributed but results in a number that would make the sequence non-increasing or equal, that could potentially fail the strict increasing condition. For example:
     - Letâ€™s say `n=10` and `k=3`. The minimum sum is `6`, and hence `d = 10 // 6 = 1`. The sequence should start as `[1, 2, 3]`, but the remainder is `4`. If we distribute this, we can create `[5, 6, 7]` (which is incorrect as it doesn't start from `1`), but instead, we can only add to existing elements of `[1, 2, 3]`, leading to `[1+4, 2, 3]` which would not be valid as it would result in `[5, 2, 3]` which is not strictly increasing.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to ensure that the sequence remains strictly increasing when distributing the remainder. Thus, there's a flaw in the logic that could yield invalid sequences.

Correctness: **False**
