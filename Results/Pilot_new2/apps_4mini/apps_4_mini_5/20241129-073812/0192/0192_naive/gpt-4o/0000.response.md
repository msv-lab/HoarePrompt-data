To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program.

The problem states that Memory can modify the length of a single side of a triangle in such a way that it remains a non-degenerate triangle with integer side lengths. The goal is to transition from an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to another of side length `y` in the minimum number of seconds.

The program provided is:
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

Now, let's break down the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`:

1. **Understanding `(x - y) // 2`**: This part calculates how many full 2-unit reductions can be made to transition from `x` to `y`. Since each operation can reduce a side length by at least 1, this gives a base idea of how many operations are needed.

2. **Understanding `(x - y) % 2`**: This part checks if there's an additional operation required if the difference `x - y` is odd. If `x - y` is odd, one more operation will be needed to fully reach `y` as we can only reduce by whole numbers.

3. **Summarizing**: Thus, the total number of seconds required is the number of 2-unit operations plus an additional operation if the difference is odd.

### Test cases based on the problem description:

1. **Case: (6, 3)**:
   - `x - y = 3`, `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`. The program should return 4 as shown in the output examples. This is incorrect.

2. **Case: (8, 5)**:
   - `x - y = 3`, `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`. The program should return 3 as shown in the output examples. This is incorrect.

3. **Case: (22, 4)**:
   - `x - y = 18`, `(22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`. The program should return 6 as shown in the output examples. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle a range of cases where the expected output does not match what the program computes, particularly for the provided examples in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
