The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. The condition `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000` ensures that both `x` and `y` are integers within the specified range. Therefore, `abs(x - y)` will yield a non-negative integer value.

Since the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, the exact output cannot be determined, but based on the conditions, we can express `abs(x - y)` as `x - y` since `x` is always greater than `y`.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` is an integer greater than `y`, and `abs(x - y)` has been printed, which equals `x - y`.**
