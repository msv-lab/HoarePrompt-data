To assess the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the main function `func_2(n, k)` and see whether it accurately computes the irreducible fraction representation of the probability that at least two of `k` people have the same birthday among `2^n` days.

### Review of Functionality:

1. **Input Handling**: The program checks if `k > 2^n`, which would mean that it's impossible for `k` people to have unique birthdays. In this case, it correctly returns `1 1` since the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is `1`.

2. **Calculating Probabilities**:
   - The total number of days is calculated as `total_days = 1 << n` (which is `2^n`).
   - The numerator and denominator of the probability are initialized.
   - The loop iterates over the number of people `k`, computing the number of ways to select `k` people with unique birthdays (numerator) and the total possible assignments of birthdays (denominator).

3. **Reducing Fractions**:
   - After calculating the numerator and denominator of the probability, it uses the `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) to reduce `A` and `B` to their irreducible form.

4. **Final Output**: It prints the resulting values of `A` and `B`, both modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Potential Edge Cases:

Let's consider edge cases that might not be handled properly by the code:

1. **Extreme Values**: The program is supposed to handle values up to `10^18`. Python supports large integers, but the computation could be slow and could potentially take a long time or fail due to memory limitations when `k` is very large.

2. **When k = 2^n**: The case where `k` equals `2^n` needs careful consideration. The probability in this case should still be `1`, which is correctly handled.

3. **Large Values of k**: If `k` is slightly less than `2^n`, the program should still perform calculations correctly and efficiently without overflowing or producing incorrect probabilities. 

4. **Reduction Logic**: The reduction of `A` and `B` using GCD must correctly reduce the numbers before applying the modulo operation.

5. **Numerical Stability**: The calculations for `numerator` and `denominator` involve large multiplications and could lead to overflow if not handled properly, but given Python's handling of integers, this shouldn't be a problem.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic and potential edge cases, the program appears to handle the requirements of the problem description accurately. The checks for `k` against `2^n` are clear, and the algorithm correctly reduces the fraction and outputs the required results modulo `10^6 + 3`.

Since I can't find any specific edge cases where the program fails to meet the description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday and outputs the results in the required format.
