The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, calculates a `numerator` and `denominator` based on `total_days = 2^n`, and then returns the tuple containing `numerator % (10^6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10^6 + 3)`. However, if `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `numerator` becomes 0, leading to a return value of (0, denominator % (10^6 + 3)). Therefore, the function returns (0, denominator % (10^6 + 3)) when `k` is at least 3, effectively making `numerator` always zero in those cases.
