`denominator` is assigned the value of 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, and the value of `denominator` is now explicitly defined. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to 2; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.**
