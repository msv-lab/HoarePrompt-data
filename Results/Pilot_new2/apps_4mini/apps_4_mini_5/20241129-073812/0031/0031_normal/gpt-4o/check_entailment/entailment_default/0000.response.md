To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the details step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
ZS the Coder wants to find the probability that at least two out of `k` people share the same birthday when there are `2^n` possible days. The output must be given as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), and both \( A \) and \( B \) should be coprime before taking modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Function 1 (GCD Calculation)**:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       while b:
           (a, b) = (b, a % b)
       return a
   ```
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of two integers which is used to reduce \( A \) and \( B \).

2. **Function 2 (Main Logic)**:
   ```python
   def func_2(n, k):
       MOD = 10 ** 6 + 3
       if k > 1 << n:
           print(1, 1)
           return
       total_days = 1 << n
       numerator = 1
       denominator = 1
       for i in range(k):
           numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD
           denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD
       p_no_shared = numerator
       p_total = denominator
       p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
       A = p_shared
       B = p_total
       g = func_1(A, B)
       A //= g
       B //= g
       print(A % MOD, B % MOD)
   ```

   - The function starts by checking if \( k \) exceeds \( 2^n \). If it does, it correctly outputs \( (1, 1) \) since at least two people must share a birthday.
   - If \( k \) is within bounds, it calculates the number of ways to choose `k` birthdays from `2^n` days and computes the probability of shared birthdays using combinatorial logic.
   - The calculations for `numerator` and `denominator` seem to follow the logic correctly for finding the probability of shared birthdays.
   - Finally, it reduces \( A \) and \( B \) using their GCD before producing the output.

### Reviewing Output Hints:
- **Output Description for Function 2** states that the function returns \( (1, 1) \) if \( k > 2^n \), which is correct.
- It also implies that the function computes values based on combinatorial logic but claims the final output is still \( (1, 1) \) regardless of the computations. This is incorrect because the function does compute non-trivial values of \( A \) and \( B \) when \( k \leq 2^n \).

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **When \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 2 \)**: The output should be \( 1, 2 \) (not \( 1, 1 \)), since two people can have a birthday in two days, and the chance they do not share a birthday is \( 1/2 \).
2. **When \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 3 \)**: The output should be \( 1, 1 \), which the code correctly handles.

### Conclusion:
The problem description expects a correct output for all possible combinations of \( n \) and \( k \). While the code does handle several cases correctly, the output hints incorrectly suggest that the final output is always \( (1, 1) \) when \( k > 2^n \) which may lead to misunderstanding.

Upon reviewing the complete logic and output hints, we find that the hints do not accurately represent what the function computes.

Thus, the function does not meet the program description for every potential case due to the discrepancies in the output hints.

Correctness: **False**.
