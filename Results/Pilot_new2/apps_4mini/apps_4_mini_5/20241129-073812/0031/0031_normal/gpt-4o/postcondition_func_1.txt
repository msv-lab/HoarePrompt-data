The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, and returns (1, 1) if `k` is greater than \(2^n\). Otherwise, it computes values based on combinatorial logic involving `n` and `k`, but the final output is still (1, 1) regardless of the computations. Therefore, the function effectively always returns (1, 1).
