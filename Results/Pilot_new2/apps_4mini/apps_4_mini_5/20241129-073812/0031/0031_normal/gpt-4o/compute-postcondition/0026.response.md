To simulate the execution of the provided code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \)
- `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \)
- `MOD` is \( 1000003 \)
- `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \)
- `numerator` is equal to the product of \( (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003 \)
- `denominator` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \)
- `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`
- `p_total` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \)
- `p_shared` is equal to \( (p_total - p_no_shared + 1000003) \mod 1000003 \)
- `A` is equal to `p_shared` divided by `g`
- `B` is equal to \( p_total \)
- `B` is equal to \( p_total // g \)

The code snippet:
```
print(A % MOD, B % MOD)
```

Let's analyze the impact:

1. The code calculates \( A \) and \( B \) but does not modify the existing variables directly. Instead, it prepares values for output.
2. Since the print statement outputs the values of \( A \% MOD \) and \( B \% MOD \), we need to understand that:
   - `A` would be calculated from `p_shared` divided by `g`, but `g` is not defined in the context provided.
   - `B` is the value of \( p_total \) divided by \( g \).
3. The values of \( A \) and \( B \) are computed based on the previously defined variables and `g`.

After executing the provided code, we do not have specific values for `A` and `B` since `g` is undefined. Therefore, we retain the variable definitions while updating only what can be calculated based on existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \); `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \); `MOD` is \( 1000003 \); `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \); `numerator` is equal to the product of \( (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003 \); `denominator` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \); `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`; `p_total` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \); `p_shared` is equal to \( (p_total - p_no_shared + 1000003) \mod 1000003 \); and `A` and `B` are values determined by `p_shared` and `p_total` respectively, divided by `g`.**
