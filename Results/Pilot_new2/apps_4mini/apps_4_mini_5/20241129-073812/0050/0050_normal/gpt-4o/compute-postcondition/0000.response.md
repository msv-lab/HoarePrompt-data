In the provided code snippet, the initial state includes the variables `n`, `m`, and `r`, which are all positive integers within specified ranges. The line of code is taking input for these three variables, which means their values will be set based on user input.

The impact of the code:
- `n`, `m`, and `r` will be assigned new values based on the integer inputs received.
- The lists `s` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `r` depend on user input, we can only describe them as being replaced by the input values. 

Output State: **`n` is the input value between 1 and 30, `m` is the input value between 1 and 30, `r` is the input value between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a list of n integers where each integer s_i is a price (1 <= s_i <= 1000), and `b` is a list of m integers where each integer b_i is a price (1 <= b_i <= 1000).**
