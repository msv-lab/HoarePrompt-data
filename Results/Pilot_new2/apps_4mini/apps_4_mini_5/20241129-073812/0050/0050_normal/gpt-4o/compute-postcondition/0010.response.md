To calculate the new value of `total_bourles`, we will use the variables provided in the initial state:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - `max_shares = r // min_buy_price`
   - `max_sell_price` = maximum value in list `b`
   - `remaining_bourles = r % min_buy_price`

2. **Calculate `total_bourles`:**
   - `total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`

Given the constraints that:
- `n` is the input value between 1 and 30
- `m` is the input value between 1 and 30
- `r` is the input value between 1 and 1000
- `s` is a list of `n` integers
- `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 1000
- `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`
- `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`
- `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`

The calculations will depend on the specific values of `r`, `min_buy_price`, and `max_sell_price`. 

Assuming:
- `max_shares` will be correctly derived from the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`.
- `remaining_bourles` will be the remainder of the division of `r` by `min_buy_price`.

**Output State:**
`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 1000, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is equal to `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.
