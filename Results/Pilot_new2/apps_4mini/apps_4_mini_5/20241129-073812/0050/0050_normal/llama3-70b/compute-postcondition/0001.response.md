The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created from the integers input by the user. The input is converted into integers and mapped into a list. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `n` specifies the length of the list `s`, which contains integers. Since `s` is now populated with user input, its exact values will depend on that input, but they will remain within the range specified (1 to 1000 for each element). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 30; `m` is an integer within the range 1 to 30; `r` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers which are the user inputs within the range 1 to 1000; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element b[j] (1 <= b[j] <= 1000).**
