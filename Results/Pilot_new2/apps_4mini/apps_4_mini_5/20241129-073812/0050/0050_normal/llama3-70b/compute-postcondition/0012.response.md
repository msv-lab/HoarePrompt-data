Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 0 and `s[i] - 1` after executing `r % s[i]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, and `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[i])`, with `i` equal to 0. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then `r` remains unchanged, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
