Postcondition: ***`shares` is the sum of all `r // s[i]` for each `i` such that `r >= s[i]`. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is the original value plus `shares * b[i]`, `n` is the original number of elements in `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `shares` is less than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `n` remains the original number of elements in `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is still 0.***
