Output State: **`shares` is the sum of all `r // s[i]` for each `i` such that `r >= s[i]` or `shares` is 0 if no valid divisions occurred, `r` is the original value plus `shares * b[i]` for each `i` where `shares` was greater than 0, `n` is the original number of elements in `s`, `m` is the original size of `b`, and `i` is equal to `m` if the loop executed completely or 0 if the loop did not execute.**
