The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with any leading zeros removed by the `lstrip('0')` method. The value of `data[1]` is originally a string representing a non-negative integer. The initial state of `a` and `data` remains unchanged, while `b` will now reflect this modification based on the contents of `data[1]`.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed; `b` is the string from `data[1]` with leading zeros removed; `data` is a list of strings created from input.**
