Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed. `b` is either empty or its value remains unchanged. If `b` is empty, then `b` is set to '0', and if `a` was originally empty, it is also set to '0'. The current length of `a` is less than the length of `b`.***
