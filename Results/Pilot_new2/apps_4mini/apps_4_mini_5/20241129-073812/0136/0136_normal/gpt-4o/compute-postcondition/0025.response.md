Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, then `b` is either set to '0' if empty or retains its value if not, and if `a` was originally empty, it is also set to '0'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, then '>' has been printed to the console. If the lengths are equal, the appropriate action for the comparison between `a` and `b` has been taken: if `a` is less than `b`, the appropriate action for that condition has been taken; if `a` is greater than `b`, '>' has been printed to the console; if `a` is equal to `b`, then '=' has been printed to the console.***
