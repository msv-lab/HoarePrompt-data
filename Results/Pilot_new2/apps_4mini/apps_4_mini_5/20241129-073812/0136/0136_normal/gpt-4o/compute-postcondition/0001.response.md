In the code, `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state indicates that `a` is a string representing a non-negative integer, and `data` is a list of strings created from input. The operation affects only `a`, as it transforms its value by stripping leading zeros.

If `data[0]` was, for example, "00123", `a` would become "123". If `data[0]` was "000", `a` would become an empty string. The state of `b` and the contents of `data` as a list of strings remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed, `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of strings created from input.**
