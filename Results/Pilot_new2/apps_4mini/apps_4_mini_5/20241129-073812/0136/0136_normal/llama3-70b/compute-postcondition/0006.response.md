The code snippet `print('<')` outputs the string `<`, which indicates a comparison where the value represented by `a` is less than the value represented by `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and no variables are modified.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros; `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros; `a` is less than `b`; output is '<'**
