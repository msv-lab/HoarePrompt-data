The code `print('=')` outputs the string `=` but does not change any variable values or affect the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros; `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros. The value of `a` is equal to the value of `b`.**
