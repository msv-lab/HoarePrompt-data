The function accepts two non-negative integer strings, `a` and `b`, removes any leading zeros, and compares their values. It prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, or '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. However, it does not return any value; it only outputs the comparison result directly to the console.
