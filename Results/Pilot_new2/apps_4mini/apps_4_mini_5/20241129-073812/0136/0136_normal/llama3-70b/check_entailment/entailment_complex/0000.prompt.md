You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".


-----Examples-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing at most 10^6 digits, and may include leading zeroes.
def func():
    a = input().lstrip('0')
    b = input().lstrip('0')
    if (a == b) :
        print('=')
    else :
        if (a < b) :
            print('<')
        else :
            print('>')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros, and `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, since `a` is not equal to `b` and is greater than or equal to `b`, the output is '>'
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros, and `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output confirms their equality. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer strings, `a` and `b`, removes any leading zeros, and compares their values. It prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, or '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. However, it does not return any value; it only outputs the comparison result directly to the console.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
