Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where both numbers are `0`. For example, if the input is:

```
0
0
```

The expected output should be `=` since both numbers are equal. However, after stripping leading zeros, both `a` and `b` will become empty strings. When comparing two empty strings, the result of the comparison is not defined in the context of the problem, which leads to incorrect output.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this input case, making it incorrect overall.
