The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub` of `s`. It computes a new string with the characters of `s` reduced by the counts of characters in `sub`, and then generates possible numbers from this resulting string. Finally, it returns the smallest integer from these possible numbers, based on their integer value representation. However, if no valid possible numbers can be generated after removing the characters of `sub` from `s`, this could lead to an error when trying to find the minimum. Additionally, handling of leading zeroes in the substring may not be explicitly addressed in the logic, which could affect the output.
