The variable `candidate` is assigned the value formed by joining the characters in `perm`. The value of `perm` is known to be the next permutation of `chars`, which is a string containing digits. Therefore, `candidate` will be a string representation of this next permutation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`.**
