Output State: **`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` represents all permutations of `chars`, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters in each permutation. The loop yields all valid candidates that satisfy the condition set by `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If no valid candidates exist, no yields occur. If `chars` is empty, no iterations occur, resulting in no candidates being yielded.**
