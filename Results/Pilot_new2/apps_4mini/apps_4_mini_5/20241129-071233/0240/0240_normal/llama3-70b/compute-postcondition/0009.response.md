According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop continues as long as there are more characters in `s` to process. At the end of the last iteration, we have processed the next character in `s`, which is `c`. In the next iteration, `c` will be the next character in `s` after the one that was just processed.

Since `s` is a non-empty string, we know it contains characters, and at the next iteration, `c` will be the next character following the last processed character. To determine the necessary state for the next iteration, we need to consider that `n` will be equal to `c` if `c` is in `t_set`.

If there are still characters left in `s` after the last processed character, then `c` will change to the next character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `s` still has characters left.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, `c` is the next character in `s` that must be processed (which will be the character following the last processed character in `s`)**
