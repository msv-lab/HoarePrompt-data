Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` of digits and a non-empty substring `t`, extracts the characters from `s` that are found in `t`, concatenates these characters with `t`, and returns the integer value of this concatenated string. If `s` contains characters not present in `t`, those characters will be ignored in the output. The length of `s` can be up to 1,000,000 characters. **
