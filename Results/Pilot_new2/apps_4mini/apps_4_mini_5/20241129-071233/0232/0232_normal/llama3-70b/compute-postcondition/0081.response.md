The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences, `found` is `True`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `window_counts` contains counts of colors from the `colors` list from index `i` to `n-1`. All counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts` since `found` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
