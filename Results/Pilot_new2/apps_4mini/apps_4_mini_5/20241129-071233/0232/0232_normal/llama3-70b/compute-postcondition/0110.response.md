Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors; `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences; `found` is True; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is equal to `i`; `color` is equal to `colors[i]`; `window_counts[color]` is equal to `window_counts[color] + 1`, and if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, the loop exits. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
