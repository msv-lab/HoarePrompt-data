Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each unique color from `colors` is a key and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list, `found` is `True`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `color` is `colors[0]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1, and the counts of the colors in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts` when sorted, indicating that the required color distribution has been found; otherwise, no changes are made to `found`, `i`, `j`, `color`, and `window_counts`.***
