Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences, `found` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is equal to `colors[i]`, and `window_counts[color]` is 1. If the counts of occurrences in `window_counts` match the counts in `counts` when sorted, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution without any defined action occurring in the else part.***
