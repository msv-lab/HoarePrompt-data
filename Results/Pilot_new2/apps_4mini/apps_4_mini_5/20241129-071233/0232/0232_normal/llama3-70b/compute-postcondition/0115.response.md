Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences, `found` is `True` if a valid window was found; otherwise, `found` is `False`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `window_counts` contains the counts of the colors from the last evaluated window (from the last value of `i` to `n-1`). If the loop does not execute at all, `found` remains `False`, `i` is still the original value, `j` is equal to `i`, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary.**
