The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; `k` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n; `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from each integer in the range 1 to m to the corresponding values in k; `current_counts` has one entry for `colors[0]` decreased by 1; `left` is 1; `right` is 0; and it is not the case that all entries of `current_counts` match the corresponding entries in `desired_counts`.
