Output State: **`left` is equal to the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus the number of elements in `colors` that satisfy the desired counts, `right` is 1, `current_counts` must satisfy the condition that for all colors in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is equal to `desired_counts[color]` for all colors, and the loop exited because the condition was no longer met for at least one color, meaning at least one color's count in `current_counts` became less than `desired_counts[color]`.**
