#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, colors is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and k is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n.
def func_1(n, m, colors, k):
    desired_counts = dict(zip(range(1, m + 1), k))
    current_counts = defaultdict(int)
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        current_counts[colors[right]] += 1
        
        while all(current_counts[color] >= desired_counts[color] for color in
            desired_counts):
            if all(current_counts[color] == desired_counts[color] for color in
                desired_counts):
                return 'YES'
            current_counts[colors[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `left` is the number of elements processed from the `colors` list, `right` is equal to `n`, `current_counts` contains the counts of each color seen in `colors`, and for every color in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is greater than or equal to 0 but not guaranteed to equal `desired_counts[color]`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that the current counts of colors do not meet the desired counts for some colors in the `desired_counts` despite `current_counts[color]` being greater than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `n` and `m`, a list of integers `colors`, and a list of integers `k`, and returns 'YES' if there exists a contiguous subarray within `colors` that matches the desired counts of each color specified in `k`; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
