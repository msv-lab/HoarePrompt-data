The code executes a conditional print statement based on the value of `is_spalindrome`. If `is_spalindrome` is True, it prints 'TAK'; if it is False, it prints 'NIE'. 

Since the value of `is_spalindrome` affects the output but does not change any variables, the states of the other variables remain the same. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False, and the printed output will be 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True or 'NIE' if it is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False; printed output is 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, otherwise 'NIE'.**
