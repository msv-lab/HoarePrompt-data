The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
