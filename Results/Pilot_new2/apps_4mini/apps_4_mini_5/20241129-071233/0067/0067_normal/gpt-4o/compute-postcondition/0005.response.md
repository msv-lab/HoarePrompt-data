Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]; `y` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]; `z` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The current value of `max_upvotes` is less than the current value of `min_downvotes`.***
