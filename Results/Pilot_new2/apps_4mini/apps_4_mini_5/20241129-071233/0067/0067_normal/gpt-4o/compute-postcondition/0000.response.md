The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned from input, where `map(int, input().split())` takes space-separated integers from the input and converts them to integers. The preconditions state that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100], but their specific values are now determined by the user's input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100], `y` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100], `z` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]**
