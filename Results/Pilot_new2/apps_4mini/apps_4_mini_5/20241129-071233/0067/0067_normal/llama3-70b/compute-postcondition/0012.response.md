Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and the current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`. If `z` is 0, the current values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `z` is greater than 0, a string '?' is printed.***
