The code `print('0')` outputs the string `'0'` to the console but does not change any variable values. Therefore, the states of the variables remain the same. The conditions specified in the initial state still hold true after executing the code.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the current value of `x` is equal to the current value of `y`, and the current value of `z` is 0.**
