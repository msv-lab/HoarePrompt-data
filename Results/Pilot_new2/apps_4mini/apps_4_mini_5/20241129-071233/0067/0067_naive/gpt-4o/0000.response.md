To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles different scenarios based on the inputs for upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z).

The program calculates:
- `min_upvotes` as the number of known upvotes (x).
- `max_upvotes` as the maximum possible upvotes, which is the sum of known upvotes (x) and unknown votes (z).
- `min_downvotes` as the number of known downvotes (y).
- `max_downvotes` as the maximum possible downvotes, which is the sum of known downvotes (y) and unknown votes (z).

The program then checks:
1. If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) are less than the minimum downvotes (`min_downvotes`), it prints `-` (indicating a guaranteed loss).
2. If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) are less than the minimum upvotes (`min_upvotes`), it prints `+` (indicating a guaranteed win).
3. If neither of the above conditions are satisfied, it prints `?` (indicating that the result is uncertain).

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Case with equal votes and unknowns:**
   - Input: `0 0 1`
     - Here, `min_upvotes` is 0, `max_upvotes` is 1, `min_downvotes` is 0, and `max_downvotes` is 1. 
     - The possible results could be `+` (if the unknown votes as an upvote) or `-` (if the unknown votes as a downvote). Thus, the expected output is `?`.
     - The program correctly outputs `?`.

2. **Case where upvotes are always less than downvotes:**
   - Input: `3 7 0`
     - Here, `min_upvotes` is 3, `max_upvotes` is 3, `min_downvotes` is 7, and `max_downvotes` is 7.
     - Since `max_upvotes` (3) is less than `min_downvotes` (7), it should print `-`, and the program does this correctly.

3. **Case where upvotes may be more than downvotes:**
   - Input: `2 0 1`
     - Here, `min_upvotes` is 2, `max_upvotes` is 3, `min_downvotes` is 0, and `max_downvotes` is 1.
     - Since `max_downvotes` (1) is less than `min_upvotes` (2), the expected output is `+`, and the program does this correctly.

4. **Case with equal votes:**
   - Input: `1 1 0`
     - Here, `min_upvotes` is 1, `max_upvotes` is 1, `min_downvotes` is 1, and `max_downvotes` is 1.
     - Both min and max for upvotes and downvotes are equal, so the expected output is `0`, but the program does not handle this case since it does not check for equality when both bounds are equal.

Since the program fails to account for the scenario where both upvotes and downvotes are equal and known, it does not handle all potential cases correctly. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
