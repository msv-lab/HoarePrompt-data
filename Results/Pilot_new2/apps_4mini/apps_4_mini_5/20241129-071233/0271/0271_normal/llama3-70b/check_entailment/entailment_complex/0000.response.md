Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s an explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Constraints**: The program accepts a non-negative integer `n` such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), which is in line with the provided constraints.

2. **Rounding Logic**:
   - If `n` is already a multiple of 10 (i.e., `n % 10 == 0`), the program outputs `n`, which matches the requirement that if `n` already ends with 0, it is considered rounded.
   - If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the program checks the remainder of `n` when divided by 10:
     - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5 (`n % 10 <= 5`), it calculates `n - n % 10`, which is the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. This is correct as it rounds down in this case.
     - If the remainder is greater than 5, it calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which rounds up to the next multiple of 10. This is also correct as it meets the requirement to round up in this situation.

3. **Output**: The program prints a single integer result, which is exactly what is required by the problem description.

In summary, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description by correctly rounding `n` to the nearest multiple of 10 based on the specified rules. Thus, it is deemed correct.
