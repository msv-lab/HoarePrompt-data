The code snippet `print(n)` outputs the current value of `n`. The initial state confirms that `n` is a non-negative integer within the specified range and that it is divisible by 10. There are no changes to the variable `n` after executing the code; it simply prints its value.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` is an input integer within the range 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is divisible by 10 (i.e., `n % 10 == 0`).**
