The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Given that `remainder` is defined as `n % 10`, and we know that `remainder` is greater than 5 (which can be 6, 7, 8, or 9), we can deduce that `(10 - remainder)` will yield a value between 1 and 4 since:

- If `remainder` is 6, then `(10 - remainder)` is 4.
- If `remainder` is 7, then `(10 - remainder)` is 3.
- If `remainder` is 8, then `(10 - remainder)` is 2.
- If `remainder` is 9, then `(10 - remainder)` is 1.

Thus, the value of `result` becomes `n + (10 - remainder)`, where the range of `(10 - remainder)` is from 1 to 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`, where `remainder` is between 0 and 9 inclusive and greater than 5; `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`, where `remainder` is between 0 and 9 inclusive and greater than 5; `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`.**
