To verify the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze the logic of the program against the problem description and what is expected.

### Problem Summary
Nicholas wants to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation by performing exactly one swap. The goal is to find the maximum possible distance between these two elements after the swap.

### Program Analysis
1. The program starts by reading the integer `n` and the list `a`.
2. It determines the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
3. It then calculates the distances from these elements to both ends of the array (positions 0 and n-1).
4. Finally, it finds the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Inspection of Logic
The program calculates the following distances:
- Distance from the maximum element (at `max_pos`) to the start (0).
- Distance from the maximum element to the end (n-1).
- Distance from the minimum element (at `min_pos`) to the start (0).
- Distance from the minimum element to the end (n-1).

However, the important aspect missed by this code is that it does not account for the actual swap that needs to happen in order to maximize the distance. The program simply calculates how far 1 and n can go to the ends of the array, but it does not check whether swapping the elements located at `min_pos` or `max_pos` with the respective edges of the array will actually result in a new distance greater than what is currently present.

### Example to Show Incorrectness
Letâ€™s consider a case:
- Input: 
```
4
1 3 2 4
```
- The positions of minimum (1) and maximum (n=4) are:
  - `min_pos = 0` (for 1)
  - `max_pos = 3` (for 4)
  
The maximum distance without a swap is 3 (between 0 and 3). If we swap `1` (index 0) with `4` (index 3), we will still have the same distance (3) as they will take the same positions after the swap. 

Now, if we check the distances calculated:
- Distances calculated by the program:
    - dist1 (from max to start) = 3
    - dist2 (from max to end) = 0
    - dist3 (from min to start) = 0
    - dist4 (from min to end) = 3
- The maximum of these calculated distances is 3.

However, suppose we had:
- Input: 
```
5
4 5 1 3 2
```
Here, the program would find the positions and give `distances` that do not account for the best possible swap (i.e., taking 1 from index 2 and 5 from index 1 to swap). The output would yield the maximum distance incorrectly.

### Conclusion
The program fails to consider the actual swap needed to maximize the distance and does not produce the correct maximum distance in cases where specific swaps need to be made. 

Thus, I conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
