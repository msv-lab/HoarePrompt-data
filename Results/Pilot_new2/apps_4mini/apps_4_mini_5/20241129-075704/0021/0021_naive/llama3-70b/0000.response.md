To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements.

The problem requires us to swap the minimum and maximum elements (which are 1 and n, respectively) in a permutation of integers from 1 to n, such that the distance between these two elements is maximized. 

Key points to consider:
1. We need to find the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the array.
2. The maximum possible distance between these two elements after swapping should be calculated.
3. The output should be the maximum distance achievable after exactly one swap.

Now, let's break down the provided program:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)  # position of the minimum element (1)
posn = a.index(n)  # position of the maximum element (n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)  # calculates maximum distance considering current positions
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)  # calculates minimum distance considering current positions
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))  # prints the maximum distance
```

Now, let's analyze if this program properly calculates the maximum distance after one swap:

- The variables `pos1` and `posn` capture the positions of the minimum and maximum elements correctly.
- The program calculates `max_dist` and `min_dist`, but the logic behind these calculations isn't clear in relation to maximizing the distance after a swap.
- Specifically, the logic of using `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`, `n - 2`, and the maximum function may not directly lead to the correct maximum achievable distance. 

### Problematic Case
Consider the input:
```
3
3 1 2
```
Here, the positions are:
- pos1 = 1 (position of 1)
- posn = 0 (position of 3)

The current distance is `abs(1 - 0) = 1`. The maximum distance possible by swapping would be between positions 0 and 2, which is `2`. However, the code might not correctly output this maximum distance.

After evaluating the calculations made in the code, we find that it does not correctly compute the maximum distance based on the swap conditions as required in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program does not fulfill the requirement for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
