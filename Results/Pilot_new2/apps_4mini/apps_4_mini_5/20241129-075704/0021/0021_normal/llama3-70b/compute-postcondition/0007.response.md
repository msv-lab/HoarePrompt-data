The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without input arguments. However, it operates on a set of constraints that involve an integer `n` and a list `a`. The integer `n` is required to be in the range of 2 to 100, and the list `a` must contain `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`. 

The function's output is not explicitly described in the provided information, so it cannot be determined what the function returns. Therefore, based on the constraints and relationships established, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n distinct integers (1 to n), but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
