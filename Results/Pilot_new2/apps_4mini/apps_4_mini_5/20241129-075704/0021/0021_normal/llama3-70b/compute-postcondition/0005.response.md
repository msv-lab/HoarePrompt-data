The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. The value of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` calculates the distance between the positions of `1` and `n` in the list `a`, reduced by 1. The value of `n - 2` is a static value based on the range of `n`. 

Since `n` is in the range of 2 to 100, `n - 2` will always be non-negative. The `min` function will choose the smaller of the two calculated values.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is equal to `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
