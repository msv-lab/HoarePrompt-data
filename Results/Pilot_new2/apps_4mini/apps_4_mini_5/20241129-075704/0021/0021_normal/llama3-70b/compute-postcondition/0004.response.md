The value of `max_dist` is assigned the maximum of the two expressions `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. The variable `pos1` represents the index of the integer `1`, and `posn` represents the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Given that `n` is in the range of 2 to 100, the expressions involve the absolute difference between the positions of `1` and `n`, and the value `n - 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.**
