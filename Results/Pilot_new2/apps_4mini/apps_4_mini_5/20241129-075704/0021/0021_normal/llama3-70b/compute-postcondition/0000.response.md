The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` using `int(input())`, which means `n` will be updated to an integer value provided by user input. Since `n` must remain within the range of 2 to 100, there will be no other changes to the state of the program aside from updating `n`. The list `a` remains unchanged and still consists of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that is updated to the value of `int(input())` within the range of 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`.**
