The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` containing `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, while also considering the distance from the ends of the list. The function prints the maximum distance calculated but does not return any value.
