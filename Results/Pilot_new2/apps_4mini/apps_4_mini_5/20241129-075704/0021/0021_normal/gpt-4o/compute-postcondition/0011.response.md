The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, which must be between 2 and 100 inclusive, and a list `a` containing `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. The function finds the positions of the integers 1 and `n` within the list `a`. It then calculates the distances from these positions to both ends of the list (the start and the end) and determines the maximum of these distances. Finally, it prints this maximum distance.

It is important to note that the function assumes the presence of integers 1 and `n` within the input list `a`, as it directly uses the `index` method which will raise a `ValueError` if either 1 or `n` is not found. This potential edge case is not addressed in the annotations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and n inclusive), calculates the distances of the elements 1 and n from the ends of the list, and returns the maximum of those distances by printing it. If either integer 1 or n is not present in the list, a ValueError will occur. **
