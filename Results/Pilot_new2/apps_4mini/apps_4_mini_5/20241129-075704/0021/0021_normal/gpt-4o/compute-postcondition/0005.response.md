`dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. Given that `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100 and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, the value of `dist2` will be a non-negative integer representing the distance from the last position (index `n-1`) to `max_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive); `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive); `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.**
