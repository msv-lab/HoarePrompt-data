`dist3` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - min_pos)`, which means `dist3` will now be equal to `min_pos`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive); `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive); `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`.**
