To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program and its logic in relation to the requirements of the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Annotated Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and then a list `a` of `n` integers, which are distinct and range from `1` to `n`. This is consistent with the problem constraints.

2. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Positions**:
   - The program correctly identifies the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) using:
     ```python
     min_pos = a.index(1)
     max_pos = a.index(n)
     ```

3. **Calculating Distances**:
   - The program calculates four potential distances based on swapping either the minimum or maximum element with an element at the ends of the array (position 0 or position n-1):
     - `dist1`: Distance if we swap the maximum with the first element.
     - `dist2`: Distance if we swap the maximum with the last element.
     - `dist3`: Distance if we swap the minimum with the first element.
     - `dist4`: Distance if we swap the minimum with the last element.
   - This approach effectively considers the maximum possible distance that can be achieved post-swap.

4. **Finding Maximum Distance**:
   - The program uses `max()` to determine the largest distance achievable by these swaps:
     ```python
     max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)
     ```

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the maximum distance.

### Correctness Verification:

Let's evaluate whether the program meets the conditions outlined in the problem description:

- **Swapping Logic**: The program considers all vital swap scenarios that could maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum integers (either swapping with the start or end of the array).
  
- **Distance Calculation**: The distances are calculated correctly based on the positions of the minimum and maximum values and the ends of the array, ensuring that the absolute position difference is computed.

- **Range of Inputs**: The program adheres to the input constraints defined in the problem description (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and distinct integers from 1 to n).

- **Output Requirements**: The output format specified in the problem description is satisfied as the program prints a single integer representing the maximum possible distance.

### Conclusion:

The program logically follows the requirements set out in the problem description, ensuring it considers all necessary swaps and calculates the correct maximum distance.

Thus, the correctness of the program is verified as follows:
Correctness: **True**
