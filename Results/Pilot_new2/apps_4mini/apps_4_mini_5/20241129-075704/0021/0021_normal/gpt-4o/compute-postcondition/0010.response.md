The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the condition \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is between 1 and \(n\) (inclusive). The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the relationships between `n` and the elements of the list `a`. 

However, since no specific output conditions or return values have been provided in the task, we cannot specify the exact behavior of the output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and n inclusive).**
