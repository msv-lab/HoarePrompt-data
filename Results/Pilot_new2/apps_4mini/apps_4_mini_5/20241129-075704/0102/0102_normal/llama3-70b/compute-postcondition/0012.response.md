Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, the output is `ones[s]`, which represents the corresponding English word for the single-digit number. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the output is `teens[s - 10]`, representing the appropriate English word for the teen number. Otherwise, the output is `tens[s // 10] + ('' if s % 10 == 0 else '-' + ones[s % 10])`, which gives the correct English word representation for the number `s` in the range of 20 to 99.***
