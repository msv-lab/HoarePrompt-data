Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly handles the conversion of an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its corresponding English words representation, as specified in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Single Digits (0-9)**: If the score is less than 10, the program uses the `ones` list to directly map the number to its word equivalent.
2. **Teens (10-19)**: For scores between 10 and 19, it correctly accesses the `teens` list, offset by 10, to get the correct word.
3. **Tens (20-99)**: For scores of 20 and above, it divides the score by 10 to find which ten group it belongs to (using the `tens` list) and then checks the remainder to see if it needs to add a word from the `ones` list. It also correctly formats the output to include a hyphen when appropriate.

The program accounts for edge cases, including:
- The score of 0, which outputs "zero" (although it is not explicitly listed in the output examples, the program handles it correctly).
- The transition from teens to twenty, ensuring that it outputs "twenty" when the score is exactly 20.
- The highest score of 99, correctly outputting "ninety-nine".

Since all cases defined in the problem description and possible edge cases are handled correctly, the program is considered correct.
