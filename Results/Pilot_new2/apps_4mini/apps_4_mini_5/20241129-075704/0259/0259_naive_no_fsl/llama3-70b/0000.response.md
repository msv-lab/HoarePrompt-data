To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code in relation to the requirements.

### Analysis of the Program
1. The program starts by reading the number of bus routes (`n`) and the time (`t`) Serval goes to the bus station.
2. It then reads each bus route's first arrival time (`s_i`) and the interval (`d_i`).
3. The program's goal is to find the bus route that Serval can catch first after he arrives at the station.

### Logic Breakdown
The key part of the program is this line:
```python
time = (t - s) % d
```
This calculation attempts to determine the next bus's arrival time after Serval arrives at `t`. However, it doesn't properly account for the cases when `s` is greater than `t`, which means Serval misses the first bus. The correct logic should instead determine the next bus's time based on the following scenarios:

1. If `s` is greater than or equal to `t`, then Serval can catch the first bus that arrives at `s`.
2. If `s` is less than `t`, we need to find out when the next bus arrives. This can be computed by:
   - If `t` is less than `s`, then the next bus is simply at `s`.
   - If `t` is greater than `s`, the calculation should correctly compute the first bus time that occurs after `t` using:
   ```python
   next_bus_time = s + ((t - s + d - 1) // d) * d
   ```

### Potential Failing Case
Let's consider the scenario:
- Input:
```
1 10
5 3
```
- Here, `s = 5` and `d = 3`. The buses arrive at `5, 8, 11, ...`
- Serval arrives at `10`, and according to the logic in the code, it will calculate:
```python
time = (10 - 5) % 3  # This gives 2
```
- This means it will record that the bus arrives at `10 - 2 = 8`, but the next bus after `10` is actually at `11`. Hence, Serval would not catch the bus at `8`.

### Conclusion
The program fails to correctly calculate the next bus time after Serval arrives if he arrives after the first bus has already come but before the next bus. Thus, there exists at least one input scenario where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
