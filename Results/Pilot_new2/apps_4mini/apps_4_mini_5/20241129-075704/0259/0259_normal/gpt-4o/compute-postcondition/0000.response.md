The code assigns the value of `float('inf')` to `min_wait_time`, indicating that it is set to positive infinity. The values of `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf')**
