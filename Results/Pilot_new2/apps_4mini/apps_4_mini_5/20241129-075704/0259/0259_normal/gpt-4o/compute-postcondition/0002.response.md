According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0 and incrementing on each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. Given that `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` must be set to 0 since that is the value it takes on the first iteration. Additionally, `min_wait_time` is set to float('inf') and `chosen_route` is -1, but these states do not affect the ability of the loop to execute. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
