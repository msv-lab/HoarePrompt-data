Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`, which is non-negative. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and if `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. The current value of `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.***
