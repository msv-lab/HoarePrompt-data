The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is initially 0, `chosen_route` will be equal to 0 + 1, which is 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1**.
