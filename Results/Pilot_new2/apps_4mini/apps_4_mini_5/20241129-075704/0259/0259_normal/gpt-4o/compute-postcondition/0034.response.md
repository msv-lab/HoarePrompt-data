To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions specified.

Initial State: `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`; `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`. The logic determines the value of `wait_time` based on comparisons of `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`. Following the computations, `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`.

Since `min_wait_time` is being updated to the value of `wait_time`, the output state will reflect the final values of the relevant variables after this assignment. However, without knowing the conditions that lead to the calculation of `wait_time`, we cannot specify its final value. Therefore, we will state that `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, but we cannot provide an exact numerical value for `wait_time` since it depends on the logic that was applied before this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`; `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`; `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
