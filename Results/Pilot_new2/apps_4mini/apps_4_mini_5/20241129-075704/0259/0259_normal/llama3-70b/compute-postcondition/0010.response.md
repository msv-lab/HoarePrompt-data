The line of code `buses.append((s, d))` adds a new tuple `(s, d)` to the `buses` list. The state of `n`, `t`, and the loop variable remains unchanged, but the `buses` list will now contain one additional tuple. The specific values of `s` and `d` that will be added are dependent on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple (s, d), loop variable is 2, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, and `buses` now contains one additional tuple (s, d).**
