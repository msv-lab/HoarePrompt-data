The variable `ans` is assigned the value `i + 1`. The value of `i` is currently 2, so `ans` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `i` is 2; `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`; `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`; `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`; `min_time` is equal to `time`; `ans` is 3.**
