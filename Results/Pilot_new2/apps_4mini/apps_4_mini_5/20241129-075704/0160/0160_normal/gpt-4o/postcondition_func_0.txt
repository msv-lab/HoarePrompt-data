The function accepts a list of integers where the first integer represents N, the second integer represents K, and the subsequent integers are the elements from which to compute the GCD. It returns the GCD of all the integers in the list. The function assumes that there are at least two integers in the list and does not handle cases where the list has fewer integers or if any integers are zero, which could cause the GCD calculation to be undefined in certain contexts.
