The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer that is less than or equal to 10^9, and `A` is a list of N integers where each element `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6. The function's output is not explicitly described, so we cannot detail the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `N`, `K`, and `A` with the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (an integer between 2 and 500), K (a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9), and A (a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6).**
