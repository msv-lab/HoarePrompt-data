According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. Given that `gcd` is at least 4, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be at least 2, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. The next value of `i` for the loop will be 3 during the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `i` will be 3 in the next iteration, we need to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 3. This means `gcd` must be at least 9 (since the square root of 9 is 3).

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` must be at least 9, `i` is 3**
