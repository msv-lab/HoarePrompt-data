The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` is equal to the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, `i` is `N-1`, and `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` is equal to the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, `i` is `N-1`, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`.**
