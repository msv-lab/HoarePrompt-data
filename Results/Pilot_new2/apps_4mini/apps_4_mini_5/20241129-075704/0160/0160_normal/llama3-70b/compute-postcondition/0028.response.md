To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we understand the behavior of the loop in relation to the variables involved. 

The loop iterates through integers \(i\) from 1 to \(\text{int}(\sqrt{\text{gcd}})\). During each iteration:
- If \(\text{gcd} \mod i = 0\), it checks if \(i\) is a divisor and updates \(\text{max\_divisor}\) to be the maximum of its current value and \(i\). 
- If \(i \times i \neq \text{gcd}\), it also checks the corresponding divisor \(\text{gcd} // i\) and updates \(\text{max\_divisor}\) accordingly.

After all iterations, the final state of the variables will be determined by the largest divisor found up to \(\sqrt{\text{gcd}}\).

The conditions for the loop to execute at least once are that \(\text{gcd} \geq 1\) (as the loop starts at 1). 

Now we can formulate the output states after all iterations:

1. If \(\text{gcd} = 1\):
   - The loop executes once, setting \(\text{max\_divisor} = 1\).
   
2. For \(\text{gcd} = 2\):
   - The loop executes twice, updating \(\text{max\_divisor} = 2\).

3. For \(\text{gcd} = 3\):
   - The loop executes three times, and \(\text{max\_divisor} = 3\).

4. For \(\text{gcd} = 4\):
   - The loop executes twice, and \(\text{max\_divisor} = 4\).

This process continues, and we establish that after the loop completes:
- The maximum divisor found will be \(\text{max\_divisor} = \text{gcd}\) if \(\text{gcd}\) is a perfect square or if the largest divisor less than \(\sqrt{\text{gcd}}\) is less than \(\text{gcd}\).

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, we derive the following output state:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, `max_divisor` is equal to the largest divisor of `gcd`, and `i` is equal to `int(sqrt(gcd))`.**
