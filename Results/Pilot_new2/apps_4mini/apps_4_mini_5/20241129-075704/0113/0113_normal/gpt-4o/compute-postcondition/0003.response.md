The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained by the condition that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained by the condition that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the program calculates a value `x` which is equal to n multiplied by (10 divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return the value of `x`, which is calculated based on `n` and its relationship with 10. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer) and k (a non-negative integer), and returns x, which is equal to n multiplied by (10 divided by the gcd of n and 10).**
