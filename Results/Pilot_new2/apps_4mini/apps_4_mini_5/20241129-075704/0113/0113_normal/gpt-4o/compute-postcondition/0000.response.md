The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. The value of `k` is a non-negative integer between `0` and `8`, so the possible values for `multiplier` will range from `1` (when `k` is `0`) to `100000000` (when `k` is `8`). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`; `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ k ≤ 8`; `multiplier` is `10 ** k`.**
