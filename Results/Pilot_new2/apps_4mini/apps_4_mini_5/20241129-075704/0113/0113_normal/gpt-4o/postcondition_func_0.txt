The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It calculates `x` as the product of `n` and (10 divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and 10). The function returns `x`. The value of `k` is not used in the computation, which could indicate a missing functionality related to the multiplier based on `k`.
