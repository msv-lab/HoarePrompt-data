The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (input by the user) and rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` (i.e., `n % 10`) is 0 to 5, it subtracts the last digit from `n`. If the last digit is 6 to 9, it adds the difference to reach the next multiple of 10. The result is printed, but the function does not return any value.
