The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a variable `n`, which is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, without additional information on what the function returns or does, we cannot specify the return value or the functionality clearly. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` cannot be determined without further details regarding its output based on the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value cannot be determined without additional information.**
