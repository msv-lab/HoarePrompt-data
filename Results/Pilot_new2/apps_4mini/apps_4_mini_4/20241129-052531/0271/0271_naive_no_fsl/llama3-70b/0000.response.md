To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the rounding logic it implements against the problem description.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: If `n % 10 == 0`, the program correctly identifies that `n` already ends in `0`, and thus prints `n` as is.
   
2. **Condition 2**: If `n % 10 <= 5`, the program computes `n - n % 10`, which rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of `10`. This is correct according to the problem since it is the nearest integer ending in `0`.
   
3. **Condition 3**: If `n % 10 > 5`, the program computes `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which rounds `n` up to the next multiple of `10`. This is also correct.

### Edge Cases:
- **n = 0**: This case is handled correctly because `0 % 10 == 0`.
- **n = 1, 2, 3, 4**: These will all round down to `0`, which is correct.
- **n = 5**: This case is covered as it will yield either `0` or `10`, both being valid.
- **n = 11, 12, 13, 14**: These round down to `10`, which is correct.
- **n = 15**: This rounds either to `10` or `20`, both of which are valid outputs.
- **n = 16, 17, 18, 19**: These round to `20`, which is correct.
- **n = 20**: This case is also correctly handled as it equals a multiple of `10`.

### Potential Issues:
Upon reviewing the logic, it appears that all potential edge cases that can arise from the constraints (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) are already addressed by the conditions in the program. 

The rounding logic effectively covers both directions (rounding down and up) depending on the value of `n mod 10`. Since there are no identified edge cases that can result in incorrect outputs given the conditions, we conclude that the program adheres to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the program works correctly for all potential cases within the specified input range, we can conclude that the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
