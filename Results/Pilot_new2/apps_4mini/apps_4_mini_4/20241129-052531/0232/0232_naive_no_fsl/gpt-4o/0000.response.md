Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies whether there exists a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights with the desired counts of lightsaber colors. It uses a sliding window technique to maintain a count of the lightsaber colors within the current window defined by the `left` and `right` pointers.

### Explanation:
1. **Data Structures**: The program utilizes a dictionary `desired_counts` to map the colors to their desired counts and a `defaultdict` called `current_counts` to keep track of the counts of colors in the current window of consideration.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - It expands the window by iterating with the `right` pointer and adding the color at `colors[right]` to the `current_counts`.
   - Once the counts of the colors in `current_counts` meet or exceed the desired counts in `desired_counts`, the program checks if they exactly match.
   - If they match, it immediately returns 'YES'.
   - If they don't match, the program starts shrinking the window from the left by incrementing `left` until the condition is violated, thus maintaining efficiency.

3. **Correct Outputs**:
   - If a contiguous segment with the exact counts is found, it outputs 'YES'.
   - If after checking all possible segments no such segment is found, it outputs 'NO'.

Given the constraints (with a maximum of 100 Jedi Knights and colors), the algorithm efficiently checks potential intervals, leading to a conclusion based on the input conditions.

Overall, the program handles the problem as described, including the necessary checks for exact counts, and thus it is correct for all possible valid inputs based on the problem description.
