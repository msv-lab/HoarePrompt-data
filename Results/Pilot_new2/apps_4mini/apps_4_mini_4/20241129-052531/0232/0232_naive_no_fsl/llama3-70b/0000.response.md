Correctness: **False**

The given program fails to account for specific edge cases where the counts of the colors might not match the expected counts even when some contiguous subarray has the same number of elements. 

Consider the following case:
```
Input:
4 2
1 1 2 1
2 1
```

In this case, the input specifies that there are 2 lightsabers of color 1 and 1 lightsaber of color 2 needed. However, the only contiguous subarray of Jedi Knights is `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which contains 3 of color 1 and 1 of color 2, and thus does not meet the requirement of exactly 2 of color 1 and 1 of color 2. 

The program will incorrectly return "YES" due to how it checks the counts against sorted values instead of directly comparing the specific required counts. Therefore, the program does not handle this situation correctly. 

This indicates that the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, hence the correctness is False.
