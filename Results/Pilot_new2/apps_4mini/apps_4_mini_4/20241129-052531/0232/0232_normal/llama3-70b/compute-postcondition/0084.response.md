The code assigns an empty dictionary to `window_counts`. This means that the previous contents of `window_counts` will be cleared, and it will no longer reflect the colors and their counts corresponding to the last `n - 1` indices in the `colors` list. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `found` remain unchanged in this execution.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is True**
