Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (1 to 100) and `m` (1 to `n`), a list of `n` integers representing the colors of lightsabers, and a list of `m` integers representing desired counts. It checks if there exists a contiguous subarray of the `colors` list where the frequency of each unique color matches the corresponding desired counts. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
