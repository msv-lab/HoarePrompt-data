Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `window_counts` contains counts of colors from `colors[2]` to `colors[n - 1]`, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the targets in `counts`, otherwise `found` is False. If the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, and `found` is True.**
