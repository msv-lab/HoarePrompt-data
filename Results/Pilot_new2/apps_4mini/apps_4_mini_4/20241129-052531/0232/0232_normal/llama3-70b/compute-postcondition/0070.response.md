Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 1, and `color` is equal to `colors[2]`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
