The statement `break` is encountered, which leads to an immediate exit from the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 1, where `color` is equal to `colors[3]`, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
