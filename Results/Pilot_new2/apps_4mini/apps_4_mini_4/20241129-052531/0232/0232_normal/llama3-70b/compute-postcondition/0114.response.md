Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `window_counts` contains counts of colors from `colors[2]` to `colors[n - 1]`, and `found` is True. If `found` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, and `found` is True.***
