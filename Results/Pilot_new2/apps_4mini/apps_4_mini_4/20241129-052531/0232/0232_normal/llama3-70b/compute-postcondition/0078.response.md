Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 1 where `color` is equal to `colors[3]`, and all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop.***
