Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing at least 2 integers, `color` is the second element in the `colors` list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from user input, and if `color` is not already present in `color_counts`, then `color_counts` will have `color` as a key with a value of `1`. If `color` is already a key in `color_counts`, then `color_counts` remains unchanged.***
