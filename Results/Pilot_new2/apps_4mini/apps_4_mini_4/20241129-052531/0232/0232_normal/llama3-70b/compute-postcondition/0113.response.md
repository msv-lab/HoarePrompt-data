The values of the variables do not change as we simply break out of the loop. Since there is no other code that would modify the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `window_counts`, or `found`, their states remain intact. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `window_counts` contains counts of colors from `colors[2]` to `colors[n - 1]`, and `found` is True, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match the targets in `counts`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
