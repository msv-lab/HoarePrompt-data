The value of `color` is reassigned to the value of `colors[j]`, which will change its previous value (from `colors[1]`) to whatever `colors[j]` is. The initial states of `n`, `i`, and `window_counts[color]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 1.**
