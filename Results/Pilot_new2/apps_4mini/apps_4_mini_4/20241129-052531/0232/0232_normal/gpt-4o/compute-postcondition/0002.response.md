The variable `left` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers for each color such that 1 ≤ ∑(k_i) ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to m and values are counts from the list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int) with default values of 0 for any new color keys, `left` is 0.**
