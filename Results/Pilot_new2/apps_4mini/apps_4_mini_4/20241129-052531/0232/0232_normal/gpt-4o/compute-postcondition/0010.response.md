Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers such that at least one `current_counts[color] < desired_counts[color]` for some color in `desired_counts`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to `m` and values are counts from the list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int) with updated value for key `colors[right]` incremented by 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 0, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` has been decremented by 1.**
