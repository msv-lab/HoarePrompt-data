The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is `False`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `is_spalindrome` is False**.
