The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state indicates that `is_palindrome` was `True`, but now it will be updated to `False`, signifying that the string `s` is confirmed not to be a palindrome based on the provided conditions. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` must be at least 2, `is_palindrome` is now `False`, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` must be at least 2, `is_palindrome` is now False, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` of `s`.**
