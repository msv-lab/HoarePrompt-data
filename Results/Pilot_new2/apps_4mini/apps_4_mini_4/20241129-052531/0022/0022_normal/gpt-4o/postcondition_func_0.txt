The function accepts a string `s` and determines whether it is a palindrome. It returns `True` if `s` reads the same forwards and backwards, and `False` if it does not. Given the constraints, the function handles strings of length between 1 and 1000, and it checks characters in a case-sensitive manner. If `s` has a length of 1, it is always a palindrome and will return `True`.
