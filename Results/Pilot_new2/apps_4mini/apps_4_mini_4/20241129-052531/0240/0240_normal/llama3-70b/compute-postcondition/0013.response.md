`n` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with `t`. Since `n` is formed by concatenating all characters from `s` that are present in `t_set`, and `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, concatenating `t` to `n` would result in a new string that includes all characters from `s` that are in `t_set`, followed by the characters from `t`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a string formed by concatenating all characters from `s` that are present in `t_set` followed by the substring `t`, `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, and `t_set` contains the unique characters from `t`.**
