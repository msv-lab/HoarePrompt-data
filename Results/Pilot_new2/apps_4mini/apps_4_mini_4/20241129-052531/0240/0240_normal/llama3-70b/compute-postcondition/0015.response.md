The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. The parameter `s` is a non-empty string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000. The parameter `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it returns the integer value of the string 'n', which is formed by concatenating all characters from `s` that are present in `t_set` followed by the substring `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string of digits `s` and a non-empty substring `t`, and return the integer formed by concatenating selected characters from `s` with `t`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string of digits `s` and a non-empty substring `t`, and returns the integer value formed by concatenating specific characters from `s` with `t`.**
