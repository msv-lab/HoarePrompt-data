According to the code, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string of digits, it contains at least one character. Therefore, the loop can execute without any issues. The characters `c` will be the first character in `s` during the first iteration.

In this context, the state does not require adjustments beyond confirming that `s` is non-empty. The characters `t`, `t_set`, and `n` do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the first character of `s`**
