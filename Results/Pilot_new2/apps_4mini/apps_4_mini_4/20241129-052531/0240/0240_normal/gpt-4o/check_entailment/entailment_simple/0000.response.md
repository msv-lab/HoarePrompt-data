To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step and compare its functionality with the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a shuffled string `s`, which contains the digits of `n` concatenated with the number of digits in `n`, and a known substring `sub` that is part of `n`.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `s`: A shuffled string containing the digits of `n` and the length of `n`.
   - `sub`: A substring of `n`.

2. **Output Requirement**:
   - Return the smallest possible integer `n` without leading zeros, unless `n` is `0`.

### Program Breakdown

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It calculates the length of `n` (`n_len`) and creates a frequency counter for both `s` and `sub`.
   - It updates the counter for `s` by subtracting the counts found in `sub`.
   - The remaining characters are compiled into a string, and possible numbers are generated using these remaining characters alongside `sub`.
   - The smallest candidate number is found and returned as a string.

2. **Function 2 (`is_valid_number`)**:
   - This function checks if `sub` is a substring of the generated candidate number and if the length of the candidate matches `n_len`.
   - However, `n_len` is not defined inside this function, which will result in a `NameError`. This is a critical issue.

3. **Function 3 (`generate_possible_numbers`)**:
   - Generates all permutations of the remaining characters and yields candidates that are valid according to `is_valid_number`.
   - As noted earlier, if `is_valid_number` fails due to the undefined `n_len`, this function will not operate correctly.

### Issues Identified

- **Undefined Variable**: The variable `n_len` is not passed to the `is_valid_number` function, leading to a potential `NameError`. This means the function cannot verify the conditions required to determine valid candidates for `n`.
- **Permutations Efficiency**: Generating all permutations of the remaining characters could lead to performance issues for large inputs (up to 1,000,000 characters). This approach is not efficient and may not yield a valid result within a reasonable time frame.
- **Leading Zero Handling**: The program does not explicitly handle leading zeros when generating the smallest number from permutations, which could result in invalid outputs for certain configurations.

### Conclusion

Due to the critical issue of the undefined variable `n_len`, the program will not function as expected in all cases. It cannot guarantee a valid output that meets the problem requirements, especially when larger input sizes are encountered, and it lacks proper checks for leading zeros.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**
