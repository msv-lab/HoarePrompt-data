The statement `yield candidate` is used to produce a value from a generator function without terminating the function execution. In this case, `candidate` is being yielded, which means it is returned to the caller while maintaining the state of the function for future calls. The value of `candidate` is not provided but is understood to be derived from the next permutation of `chars`. The values of `chars` and `sub` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring, `candidate` has been yielded.**
