In the provided code snippet, `divisors.add(x // i)` is executed. Here, `x` is a tuple consisting of three elements: an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of integers `A`. The variable `i` is equal to 2. The operation `x // i` will yield `N // 2`.

The value of `divisors` is updated by adding the result of `N // 2`. Since `divisors` already includes the value 2, it will now include both 2 and `N // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where `x[0]` is N (4 <= N <= 500), `x[1]` is K (0 <= K <= 10^9), `x[2]` is a list of N integers A; `divisors` now includes the values 2 and N // 2; `i` is 2.**
