According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the integer value of the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is at least 4, which means the value of `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be at least 2 (since the square root of 4 is 2). 

In the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `gcd` is at least 4, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 2, and thus the loop condition will not hold true for the next iteration as `3` is greater than `2`.

Thus, the updated states will reflect that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 3 and `gcd` should still be at least 4. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is at least 4, `i` is 3**
