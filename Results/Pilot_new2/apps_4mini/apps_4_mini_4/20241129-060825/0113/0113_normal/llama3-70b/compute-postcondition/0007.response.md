The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` is now `n + 2`, which cannot be a multiple of 10. After adding 1 to `n`, the new value of `n` becomes `n + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is now `n + 3`, and `n + 2` must not be a multiple of 10.**
