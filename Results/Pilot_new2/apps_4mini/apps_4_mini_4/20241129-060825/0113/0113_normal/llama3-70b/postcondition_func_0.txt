The function accepts two integers, `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` (where 0 ≤ k ≤ 8), reads them from input, and then computes the smallest multiple of 10^k that is greater than or equal to `n`. It prints this result, but does not return any value. If `n` is already a multiple of 10^k, it will print `n` without any changes.
