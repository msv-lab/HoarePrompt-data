In the given code, `multiplier` is assigned the value of \(10^k\). The variable `k` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to 8, meaning `multiplier` will take values from \(10^0 = 1\) to \(10^8 = 100000000\). The other variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the execution of this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` equals 10 raised to the power of `k`, which is in the range of 1 to 100000000.**
