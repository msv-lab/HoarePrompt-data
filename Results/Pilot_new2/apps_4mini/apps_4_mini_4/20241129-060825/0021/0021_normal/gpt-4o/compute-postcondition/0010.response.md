The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n. The functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided output, so it is unclear what the return value is based solely on the parameters and their constraints. Therefore, without additional information about the output or behavior of the function, we cannot ascertain its functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n distinct integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n).**
