`max_pos` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` contains `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`, the value of `max_pos` will be the index position where `n` appears in the list `a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
