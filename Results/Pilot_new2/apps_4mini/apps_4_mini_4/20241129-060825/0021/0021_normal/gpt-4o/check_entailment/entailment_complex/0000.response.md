Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all cases. 

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The program calculates distances from both ends of the array (index 0 and index n-1) to the positions of the minimum and maximum elements. However, the goal is to determine the maximum distance achievable by performing exactly one swap, not just the distances to the ends. The program does not account for the specific swap that would maximize the distance between the positions of `1` and `n`.

2. **No Actual Swap Mechanism**: The problem states that a swap must occur to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. The implementation does not perform any swap; it merely calculates potential distances without considering how a swap can change these distances effectively.

3. **Ignoring Actual Swap Scenarios**: The program lacks logic to evaluate which elements should be swapped to maximize the distance after the swap. It simply checks distances to the ends of the array, which does not address the requirement of performing one swap to achieve the maximum distance.

### Example Failure Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  5
  1 2 3 4 5
  ```
  Here, the current distance between `1` (min) and `5` (max) is `4`. To maximize the distance, swapping `1` and `5` would give a distance of `4`. However, the program will incorrectly conclude that the maximum distance is `4` without considering any swaps due to its faulty distance calculation approach.

In summary, the program does not adhere to the problem description because it fails to execute the necessary swap, does not evaluate potential swaps correctly, and simply calculates limited distances from the array ends. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of maximizing the distance between `1` and `n` through a swap.
