The variable `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. Given that `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, we need to consider its value. The value of `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. The absolute difference will be computed based on the values of `n` and `max_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos`.**
