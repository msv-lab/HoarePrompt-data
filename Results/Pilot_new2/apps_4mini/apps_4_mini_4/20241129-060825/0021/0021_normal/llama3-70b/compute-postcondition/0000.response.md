The value of `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which will take an input integer and convert it. Since `n` was initially an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), after the execution, `n` will be replaced by the new input integer while still satisfying the condition of being an integer within that range. The list `a` remains unaffected, as the code snippet does not alter it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input and satisfies the condition \(2 \leq n \leq 100\; a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to n.**
