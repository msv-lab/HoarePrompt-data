The code calculates the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` were previously defined as:

- `max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`
- `min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`

The output of the `print` function is not stored in any variable, but it results in displaying the maximum value from the computation. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers within the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is equal to `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`; the output of the print statement is `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers within the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is equal to `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); the output is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**.
