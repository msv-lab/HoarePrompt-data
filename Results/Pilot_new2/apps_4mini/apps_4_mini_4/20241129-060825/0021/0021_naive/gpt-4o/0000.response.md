To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and consider various scenarios.

The task is to swap elements in the array in order to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n). 

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
min_pos = a.index(1)
max_pos = a.index(n)
dist1 = abs(0 - max_pos)
dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)
dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)
dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)
max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)
print(max_distance)
```

### Breakdown:
1. The code correctly identifies the position of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array.
2. It computes four distances:
   - `dist1`: Distance from the start (index 0) to the maximum element.
   - `dist2`: Distance from the end (index n-1) to the maximum element.
   - `dist3`: Distance from the start (index 0) to the minimum element.
   - `dist4`: Distance from the end (index n-1) to the minimum element.
3. It then takes the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Potential Edge Case:
However, the algorithm does not explicitly ensure that the swap being considered is valid and might lead to incorrect distance calculations. For instance, if the minimum element is at index 0 and the maximum element is at index n-1, a swap between them would not be considered, and the code would incorrectly calculate the distance without handling this particular scenario effectively.

**Example Test Case:**
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- Minimum is at index 0, and maximum is at index 4.
- The maximum distance is currently 4. If we swap 1 and 5, the new array would be `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, and the distance between 1 and 5 would become 4. 

However, since the logic does not take into account the constraints of performing an exact swap, it doesn't guarantee the right results for every permutation. 

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for the correct nature of the swap that is needed to maximize the distance and thus can yield incorrect results in certain cases.

Correctness: **False**.
