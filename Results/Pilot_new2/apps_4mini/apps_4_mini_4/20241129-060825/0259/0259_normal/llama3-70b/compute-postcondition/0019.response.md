Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form (s, d), `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, `time` is equal to (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 1.***
