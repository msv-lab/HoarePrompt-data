The code `print(ans)` outputs the value of the variable `ans` but does not change any variables. The values of `n`, `buses`, and `min_time` remain unchanged. The output is dependent on the current value of `ans`, which is the 1-based index of the bus that has the minimum time observed.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is the minimum time observed across all buses; `ans` is the 1-based index of the bus that has the minimum time.**
