Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of the form (s, d), `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, if `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is set to `(t - s) % d` and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
