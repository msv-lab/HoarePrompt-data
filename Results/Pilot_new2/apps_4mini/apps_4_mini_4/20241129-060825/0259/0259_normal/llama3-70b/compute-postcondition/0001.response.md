The code initializes an empty list called `buses`. The variables `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. The states of these variables do not change as a result of this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value between 1 and 100; `t` is a positive integer value between 1 and 100000; `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000; `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000; `buses` is an empty list.**
