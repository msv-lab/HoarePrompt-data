The code assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` is previously calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`. Therefore, after the code executes, `min_wait_time` will be equal to `wait_time` based on the conditions defined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][0]`, `d_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][1]`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
