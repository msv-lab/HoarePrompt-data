The value of `chosen_route` is set to -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station (1 <= t <= 10^5), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i and d_i) representing the first bus arrival time and the interval of subsequent buses for each route (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), and `chosen_route` is -1.
