Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][0]`, and `d_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][1]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to 3. Otherwise, `min_wait_time` remains unchanged and `chosen_route` is not modified.***
