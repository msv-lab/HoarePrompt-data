According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1 after the next iteration, and for the loop to continue to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1**
