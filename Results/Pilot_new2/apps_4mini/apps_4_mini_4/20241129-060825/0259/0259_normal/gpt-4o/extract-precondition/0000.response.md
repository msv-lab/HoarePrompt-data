Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100), t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station (1 <= t <= 10^5), and bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i and d_i) representing the first bus arrival time and the interval of subsequent buses for each route (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5).**
