Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time for the next bus across all routes, `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the first bus arrival time and the interval of subsequent buses. If there are no routes (n = 0), then `min_wait_time` remains float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1.**
