The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, where 1 <= n <= 100.
- `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, where 1 <= t <= 10^5.
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i and d_i) representing the first bus arrival time and the interval of subsequent buses for each route, where 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5.

The function returns the index of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time, which is represented by 'chosen_route'. If there are no routes, 'chosen_route' remains -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`, and return the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time or -1 if no routes are available. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (time Serval goes to the station), and bus_routes (list of bus route arrival times and intervals). It returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time or -1 if there are no routes.**
