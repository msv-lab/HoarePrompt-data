The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the other variables because they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, the value of `s_i` is less than `t`, and the value of `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, and `wait_time` is 0.
