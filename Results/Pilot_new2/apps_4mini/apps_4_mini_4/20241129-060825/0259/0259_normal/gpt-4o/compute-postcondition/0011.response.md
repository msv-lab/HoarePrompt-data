Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, and `s_i`, `d_i` are values from `bus_routes[0]` with `s_i` less than `t`. If `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
