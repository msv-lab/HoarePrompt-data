Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is equal to 10. According to the problem description, the output for the score `10` should be "ten", which is correctly handled by the program. However, there is an oversight in handling the numbers in the range from 0 to 10. Specifically, for the numbers `0` (which should return "zero") and `1` to `10`, the function behaves correctly.

However, there is an additional issue with the teens handling: the `teens` list is not aligned properly. The list starts with an empty string for `teens[0]` which is not correct because `teens[0]` corresponds to `10`, but that case is handled in the `tens` list. This means that when `n` is between `11` and `19`, it will return the strings starting from `teens[1]`, which is correct. 

However, the way the code is structured means that if we wanted to check the functionality for every possible `n`, there could be confusion because there's no explicit handling of `10` in the `teens` range. 

Additionally, it does not have a clear output format specification for the hyphen usage and could result in unexpected formatting if not carefully managed.

Therefore, the program does not strictly adhere to the problem description in its current implementation due to the handling of the score `10`, leading to the conclusion that it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem.
