Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, then the string representation of `s` is given by `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the string representation is given by `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 20, the output is the string representation of `s` in tens and ones format.***
