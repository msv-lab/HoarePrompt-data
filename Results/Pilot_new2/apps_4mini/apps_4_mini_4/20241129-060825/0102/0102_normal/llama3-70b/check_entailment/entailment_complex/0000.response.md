Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here’s why it meets all the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts an integer input `s` that falls within the specified range of 0 to 99, as required.

2. **Output Requirement**: The output is a single string consisting only of English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'), with no spaces, which aligns with the problem's output specifications.

3. **Correct Mapping**:
   - For numbers less than 10, the program retrieves the corresponding word from the `ones` list, which is accurately defined for these values.
   - For numbers from 10 to 19, it uses the `teens` list to correctly map these specific values to their English representations.
   - For numbers 20 and above, the program constructs the output using the `tens` list for the tens place and the `ones` list for the ones place, appending a hyphen if there is a non-zero ones digit.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The logic covers all possible inputs from 0 to 99, ensuring that every integer within this range has a corresponding word form that is printed correctly.

5. **No Invalid Input Handling**: While the program does not handle invalid inputs, this is acceptable because the problem description specifies that the input will always meet the conditions (0 ≤ s ≤ 99).

Since the program adheres strictly to the problem description by correctly mapping every possible score to its English word representation without violations, it is deemed correct.
