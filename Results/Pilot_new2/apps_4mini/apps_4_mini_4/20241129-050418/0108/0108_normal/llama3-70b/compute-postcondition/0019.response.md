The code snippet `res += char` indicates that `char` is being appended to `res`. The value of `s` is not directly altered by this operation, but `char` is derived from `s`, and it is stated that `s` must still contain `char` after replacement. Therefore, `res` will now contain the previous value of `res` plus `char`.

If `res` previously had a certain value (which is not specified), it will be updated to include `char`. However, since we do not know the previous value of `res`, we can only refer to it as being updated.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` must still contain `char` after replacement; `res` is updated to include `char`.**
