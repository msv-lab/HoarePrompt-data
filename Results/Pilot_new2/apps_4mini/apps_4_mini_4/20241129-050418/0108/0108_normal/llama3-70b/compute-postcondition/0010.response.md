According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence within the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'ba' and `char` is 'a', which means that `char` is indeed present in `s`, allowing the loop to execute one more time without any adjustments needed. 

Therefore, no states need to be changed for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is 'ba', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
