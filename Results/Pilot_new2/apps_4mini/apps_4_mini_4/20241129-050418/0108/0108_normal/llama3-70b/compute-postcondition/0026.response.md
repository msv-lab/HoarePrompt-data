According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is found in `s`. Right before the loop, it is stated that `s` does not contain `char`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute, `s` must be adjusted to include `char`. 

This means that `s` must contain at least one occurrence of the character `char`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` must contain `char`**
