According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is found within `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` must still contain `char`, which means that `char` is present in `s`. Since `s` is updated to include the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table, `char` must still be in `s` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the state of `s` must reflect that it still contains `char` after being updated.

State: **`s` must still contain `char`, `s` is updated to include the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table, `res` is unchanged**
