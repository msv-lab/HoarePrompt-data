`j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables, `s`, `i`, and `len(s)`, remain unaffected. The conditions `len(s)` is greater than `i` and `j` must be less than `target_len` are still valid, but now `j` is one greater than its previous value.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `i` is greater than its previous value by 1; `j` is now greater than its previous value by 1; `len(s)` is greater than `i`; and `j` must be less than `target_len`.**
