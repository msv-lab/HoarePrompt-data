According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are true.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is greater than its previous value by 1, meaning `i` has been incremented.
- `len(s)` is greater than `i`, which means `i` is still less than the length of the string `s`.
- `j` is unchanged and `j` is less than `target_len`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. Since `len(s)` is greater than `i`, this condition is already satisfied.
2. For `j < target_len` to hold true, it must be ensured that `j` is still less than `target_len`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `j` is less than `target_len`. Since `j` is unchanged, we keep it as is.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `i` is greater than its previous value by 1; `j` is unchanged; `len(s)` is greater than `i`; and `j` must be less than `target_len`**.
