The value of `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `b` will take an input value that is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged, while `b` now holds the new input value. 

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `c` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000)**
