`c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. The value of `c` is now an input integer that ranges from 1 to 1000. 

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `c` is an input integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000)**.
