Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here is the breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts three positive integers that represent the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears. This adheres to the problem's requirement.

2. **Calculating Minimum Sets**: The program calculates `min_lemon`, which is the minimum number of complete fruit sets that can be formed based on the available quantities:
   - Each set requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
   - The calculation `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly determines the limiting factor among the available fruits. This ensures that we can only use as many complete sets as the fruit with the smallest ratio of required availability allows.

3. **Output Calculation**: The program then calculates the total number of fruits used based on the number of complete sets:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which means it correctly calculates the total number of fruits used in terms of the number of complete sets formed.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program appropriately handles cases where the fruits are insufficient to form even a single complete set. For example, if the available fruits are not enough to meet the proportions (such as having too few pears), `min_lemon` will be 0, leading to a total output of 0, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Range of Inputs**: While the program does not have explicit checks for the input values being within the specified range of 1 to 1000, it is stated in the annotations that the input will fall within this range, hence it will not lead to unexpected results based on the problem constraints.

Overall, the program consistently follows the problem description and handles all specified conditions, making it correct.
