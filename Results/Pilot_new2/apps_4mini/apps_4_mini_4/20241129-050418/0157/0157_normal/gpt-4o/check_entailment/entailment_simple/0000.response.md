Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three integers from input, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: The program calculates the maximum possible number of lemons that can be used in the compote based on the ratio defined in the problem. Specifically, it uses the formula:
   ```python
   max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
   ```
   This formula ensures that it does not exceed the available number of lemons, and that there are enough apples (since each lemon requires 2 apples) and pears (since each lemon requires 4 pears) to maintain the 1:2:4 ratio.

3. **Total Fruit Calculation**: The program then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote:
   ```python
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
   This correctly computes the total as `max_lemons + 2 * max_lemons + 4 * max_lemons`, which simplifies to `7 * max_lemons`. 

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits.

The program correctly implements the logic necessary to fulfill the requirements of the problem statement, ensuring that it can handle cases where not enough fruits are available to make any compote (e.g., when `max_lemons` becomes 0). 

Overall, it adheres to the constraints and needs specified in the problem description, making it correct.
