To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Description
Nikolay has:
- `a` lemons
- `b` apples
- `c` pears

He wants to prepare compote using the ratio:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits used to create the compote.

### Program Code
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

### Logic Breakdown
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. **Calculating Maximum Sets**:
   - It calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
     - `a` (total lemons available),
     - `b // 2` (how many sets of 2 apples can be made),
     - `c // 4` (how many sets of 4 pears can be made).
3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: It computes the total fruits used as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` (for lemons),
   - `max_lemons * 2` (for apples),
   - `max_lemons * 4` (for pears).
4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of fruits used.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Input Values**: If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the output should be `0` since not enough fruits of each type are available.
2. **Exact Fit Case**: If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 4`, the output should be `7` as this is the exact fit.
3. **Excess Fruits**: If `a = 10`, `b = 20`, `c = 40`, it should still compute correctly and yield `70`.
4. **No Fruits Case**: The program should handle cases where one of the fruit types (especially pears) is not available.

### Output Hints
The output hints confirm the program logic by stating:
- The function accepts three integers.
- It calculates the maximum number of sets of fruits that can be made based on the available quantities.
- The total number of fruits used in those sets is calculated correctly.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the problem description and the code, it seems that the program correctly calculates the total number of fruits based on the available quantities and the required ratio. The edge cases outlined also yield the expected results. The output hints align with the program logic as described.

Thus, the program adheres to the requirements and handles potential edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
