Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c) that can be used to maintain the required ratio of 1:2:4 for the compote. 

Here's how the program works:
1. It reads the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c).
2. It determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used by calculating the minimum of:
   - the number of lemons available (a),
   - half the number of apples available (b // 2), and
   - a quarter of the number of pears available (c // 4).
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote (max_lemons). For each max_lemons, it adds 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used.

The program handles edge cases correctly:
- If there are not enough pears, apples, or lemons to make at least one complete set (in the ratio of 1:2:4), it will output 0, which is the correct behavior.
- The program also handles all positive integer inputs (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) as specified.

All provided example cases have been accounted for and yield the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct.
