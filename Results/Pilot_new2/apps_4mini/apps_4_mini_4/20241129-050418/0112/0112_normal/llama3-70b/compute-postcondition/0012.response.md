Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, and `digits` is a set containing string representations of all integers present in all lists of `cubes`. If '0' is in `digits`, this means that `digits` contains the string representation of the integer 0; otherwise, `digits` contains string representations of integers from the lists in `cubes`, excluding '0'.***
