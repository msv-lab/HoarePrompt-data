The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, but `found` is now updated to reflect that a match has been found. The states of the other variables are not affected, as they retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `i` is 0, `found` is True, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
