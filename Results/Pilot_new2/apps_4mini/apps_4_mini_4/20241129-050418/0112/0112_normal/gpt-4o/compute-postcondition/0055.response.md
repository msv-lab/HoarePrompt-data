The statement `used_cubes[i] = True` assigns the value `True` to the `i`th index of the `used_cubes` list. The initial values of `n`, `digits`, `digit`, and `i` are as follows: `n` must be at least 4, `digits` is a list of characters representing `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, and `i` is at least 3. The operation does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is at least 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True.**
