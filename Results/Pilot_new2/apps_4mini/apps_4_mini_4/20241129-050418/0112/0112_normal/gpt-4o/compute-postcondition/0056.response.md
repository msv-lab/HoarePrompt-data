The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 4, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is at least 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `found` is True.
