The variable `digits` is assigned the value `list(str(num))`, which converts the integer `num` to a string and then creates a list of its characters. Since `num` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, its value is unknown. However, `num` must be an integer (since it is implied by the context), and thus after conversion to a string, `digits` will contain the characters representing each digit of `num`. 

No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` remains between 1 and 3, but we specify that `digits` contains the string representation of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`.**
