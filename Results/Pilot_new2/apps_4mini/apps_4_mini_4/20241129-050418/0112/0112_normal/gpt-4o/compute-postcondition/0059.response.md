According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 3, and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it at least 4. So, for the loop to be executed again, `n` must remain at least 5 (to satisfy the condition that `i` is less than `n`), and `i` will be 4.

State: **`n` is at least 5, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is 4**
