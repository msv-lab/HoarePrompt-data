The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, which means the index `i` (which is 2) of the list `used_cubes` is now marked as used. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `used_cubes[2]` is now `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `i` is 2, `found` is True, `used_cubes[2]` is True.**
