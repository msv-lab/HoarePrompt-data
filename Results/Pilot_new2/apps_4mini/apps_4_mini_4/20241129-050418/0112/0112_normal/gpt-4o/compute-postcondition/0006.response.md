The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the cube at index `i` has been used. All other variables maintain their previous values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `i` is 0, `found` is False, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
