The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, but it already has the value `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the state of this variable does not change. The states of the other variables remain unaffected as well.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `i` is 1, `found` is True, and `used_cubes[1]` is True.**
