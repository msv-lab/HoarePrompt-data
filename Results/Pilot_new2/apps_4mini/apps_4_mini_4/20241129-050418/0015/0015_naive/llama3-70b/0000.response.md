To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
You need to determine if a number `b` appears in a sequence that starts from `a` and has a difference of `c` between consecutive elements. The sequence can be represented as:
- \( s_1 = a \)
- \( s_i = a + (i - 1) \cdot c \)

You need to check if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \).

### Program Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Breakdown of logic:
1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - The sequence is constant (all elements are equal to `a`).
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO". This is correct.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which means `b` can be reached from `a` with increments of `c`.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that the number of steps (i) required to reach `b` from `a` is positive, which is valid since `i` must be a positive integer.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Potential Cases:
- Let's consider the edge cases:
  - If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = -1`, the output should be "YES" since `s_1 = 1`.
  - If `a = 1`, `b = 0`, and `c = -1`, the program will correctly determine that `b` is not in the sequence since the only element would be `1`.
  - If `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`, it should return "YES" since the sequence would only contain `0`.

### Testing Against the Provided Examples:
- Example 1: Input `1 7 3`. Output should be "YES". (Correct)
- Example 2: Input `10 10 0`. Output should be "YES". (Correct)
- Example 3: Input `1 -4 5`. Output should be "NO". (Correct)
- Example 4: Input `0 60 50`. Output should be "NO". (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it correctly handles all cases described in the problem. No contradictions or edge cases violate the program's expected output. 

Correctness: **True**. 

The program accurately identifies whether `b` exists in the sequence defined by `a` and `c` for all potential inputs within the defined limits.
