Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if the integer `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by `a` (the first element) and `c` (the common difference). Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Checking for Direct Equality**: The first condition checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If they are equal, the function correctly prints "YES", as `b` is the first element of the sequence.

3. **Handling Zero Difference (`c = 0`)**: 
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence will only consist of the single value `a`. Therefore, if `b` is not equal to `a`, the program prints "NO", which is correct as `b` cannot appear in the sequence.

4. **General Case for Non-Zero Difference**:
   - If `c` is not zero, the program evaluates whether `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`.
   - The condition `(b - a) % c == 0` checks if `b` can be reached in the sequence by ensuring that the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c`.
   - The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that the steps taken (each of size `c`) from `a` to reach `b` must be non-negative, meaning it will not require moving backward in the sequence.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it correctly prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Coverage of Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases, including when `c` is zero, when `b` is less than `a`, and the limits of the input values (from -10^9 to 10^9).

In conclusion, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases, making it correct.
