The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which are read from user input. It checks if `b` is equal to `a`, in which case it prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a`, it further checks if `c` is zero, in which case it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not zero, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. It prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Therefore, the function can output 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but does not return a value; it simply prints the result.
