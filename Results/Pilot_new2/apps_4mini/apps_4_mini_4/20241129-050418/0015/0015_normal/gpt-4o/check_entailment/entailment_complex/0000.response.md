To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the description and the program logic.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. We have a sequence \( s \) defined by:
   - The first element \( s_1 = a \)
   - The difference between consecutive elements is \( c \)
   - The elements of the sequence can be expressed as \( s_i = a + (i - 1)c \) where \( i \) is a positive integer.
2. We need to check if a given integer \( b \) exists in this sequence.
3. The output should be "YES" if \( b \) is in the sequence, otherwise "NO".

### Program Logic Analysis:
1. The function reads three integers \( a, b, c \) from input.
2. It checks if \( b \) is equal to \( a \):
   - If true, it prints "YES".
3. If \( b \) is not equal to \( a \):
   - It checks if \( c \) is zero:
     - If true, it prints "NO" (since the sequence would be constant and cannot include any number other than \( a \)).
4. If \( c \) is not zero, it checks:
   - If the difference \( (b - a) \) is divisible by \( c \) and if \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative:
     - If both conditions hold, it prints "YES".
     - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Why the program is correct:
- **Case 1:** If \( b = a \), then \( b \) definitely exists in the sequence. The program correctly outputs "YES".
- **Case 2:** If \( c = 0 \) and \( b \neq a \), all sequence elements are equal to \( a \). Thus, \( b \) cannot be in the sequence, and the program correctly outputs "NO".
- **Case 3:** If \( c \neq 0 \):
  - The expression \( (b - a) % c == 0 \) checks if \( b \) can be expressed as an element of the sequence. This ensures that the difference is a valid multiple of the step size \( c \).
  - The expression \( (b - a) / c >= 0 \) ensures that the index \( i \) calculated from the earlier equation is positive (i.e., \( b \) is not behind the start of the sequence).
- Thus, if both conditions are satisfied, \( b \) is guaranteed to be in the sequence and "YES" is printed, otherwise "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program accurately checks all relevant cases as outlined in the problem description. Therefore, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
