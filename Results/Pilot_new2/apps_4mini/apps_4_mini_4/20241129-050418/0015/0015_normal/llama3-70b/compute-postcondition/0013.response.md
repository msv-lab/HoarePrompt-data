Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, nothing is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed if either `(b - a) % c` is not equal to 0 or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0.***
