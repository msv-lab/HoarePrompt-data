The code snippet simply prints 'YES' and does not modify any of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The values of these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state maintains all the precondition information without any alterations.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that have been assigned new values based on input provided, the value of `c` is not equal to 0, the value of `b - a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0; 'YES' is printed.**
