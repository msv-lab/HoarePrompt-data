The function accepts an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and it returns `True` if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If `n` has more unique digits than `k`, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles the constraints that `n` can be very large (up to 10^18) and `k` can range from 1 to 10.
