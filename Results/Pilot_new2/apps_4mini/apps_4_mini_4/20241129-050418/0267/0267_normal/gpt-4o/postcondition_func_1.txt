The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` defining a range (with `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`) and an integer `k` (with `1 <= k <= 10`). It calculates and returns the sum of all integers `num` within the range from `l` to `r` for which the condition defined in `func_1(num, k)` returns true. If no integers satisfy this condition, the function returns 0. The sum is taken modulo `MOD` to prevent overflow.
