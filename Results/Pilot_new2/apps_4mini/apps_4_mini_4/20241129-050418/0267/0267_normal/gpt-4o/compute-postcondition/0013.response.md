The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Both `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). After executing the function body, it calculates `total_sum`, which is the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` for which another function, `func_1(num, k)`, returns `True`. If no integers satisfy this condition, `total_sum` remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the sum of integers in the specified range that meet the condition defined by `func_1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l, r, and k, and returns the sum of all integers num in the range from l to r for which func_1(num, k) returns true. If no integers satisfy this condition, it returns 0.**
