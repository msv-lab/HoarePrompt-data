The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial conditions state that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). Since the input will provide values for both `x` and `y`, the only affected variables are `x` and `y`, which will take on new integer values based on the input. The output state will indicate that `x` and `y` are now those specific input integers, while the conditions regarding the relationships between `x` and `y` must still hold true.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), `y` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq y < x\)**.
