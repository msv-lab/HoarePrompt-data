The code executes the `print` statement with the expression `abs(x - y)`, which calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the constraints \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), we know that \(x\) is always greater than \(y\). Thus, `abs(x - y)` simplifies to \(x - y\). Since \(x\) and \(y\) are input integers, we don't have their specific values but we can express the output based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), `y` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq y < x\), and the output is \(x - y\)**.
