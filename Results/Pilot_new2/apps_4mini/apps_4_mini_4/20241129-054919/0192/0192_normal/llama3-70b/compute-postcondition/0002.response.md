The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function's output is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, a specific return value or behavior cannot be determined based on the given details. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are integers satisfying the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value is not specified in the provided information.**
