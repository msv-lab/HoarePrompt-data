Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of seconds needed for Memory to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into one of side length `y`.

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Operation Requirement**: The problem states that Memory can modify the length of a single side of the triangle, but it does not clarify that he can change the lengths to be equal or non-equal to each other. The program must ensure that at any point, the triangle remains a non-degenerate triangle (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side).

2. **Mathematics of the Problem**: The program computes the number of seconds as `((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)`, which is essentially calculating how many operations are needed to reduce the side length from `x` to `y` without considering the necessary condition of maintaining a valid triangle. 

3. **Example of Failure**: Consider the input `6 3`:
   - The correct operations should be:
     - Change one side from 6 to 3 (1 second, resulting in (6, 6, 3))
     - Then reduce one of the 6s down to 4 (2 seconds, resulting in (6, 4, 3))
     - Then reduce the 6 down to 3 (3 seconds, resulting in (3, 4, 3))
     - Finally, reduce the 4 to 3 (4 seconds, resulting in (3, 3, 3))
   - The program's calculation incorrectly shows only 2 steps, which does not represent the correct sequence of operations.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the program calculates the seconds based purely on the difference in lengths without validating the triangle inequality or ensuring that the required operations maintain a valid triangle throughout the process, it is not correct.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description accurately, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
