To verify the correctness of the Python program, let's analyze the logic behind the problem description and the provided code.

The problem states that Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and wishes to reduce it to a triangle of side length `y`. The key points to consider are:

1. In each operation, a single side length of the triangle can be modified while maintaining the non-degenerate triangle condition (i.e., all sides must remain positive integers).
2. Memory needs to perform operations until all sides of the triangle are equal to `y`.

Given the points above, let's break down the operations needed to transform the triangle:

- Start with three sides of length `x`: (x, x, x).
- The target is to make all sides of length `y`: (y, y, y).

The process of reducing the side lengths would look something like this:
- To reach the target side length `y`, we need to decrease the total length of each side from `x` to `y`. This means, for each side, we need to perform `x - y` operations to reduce the length to `y`.

Now, looking at the program:

```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

This program calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the triangle of side length `y`.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The expression `(x - y) // 2` computes how many times we can decrease two sides by 1 simultaneously in a single second.
- The expression `(x - y) % 2` accounts for any remaining 1 that needs to be reduced from the last side (if `x - y` is odd).

### Verification:
Let's check the outputs for the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: Input `6 3`
   - `x - y = 6 - 3 = 3`
   - Operations = `3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (This should be correct but the correct answer is 4, so this is incorrect).

2. **Example 2**: Input `8 5`
   - `x - y = 8 - 5 = 3`
   - Operations = `3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (This should be 3, so incorrect).

3. **Example 3**: Input `22 4`
   - `x - y = 22 - 4 = 18`
   - Operations = `18 // 2 + 18 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9` (The correct answer should be 6, so again incorrect).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly account for the necessary operations to transform the triangle side lengths as described. It underestimates the required operations in various scenarios.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
