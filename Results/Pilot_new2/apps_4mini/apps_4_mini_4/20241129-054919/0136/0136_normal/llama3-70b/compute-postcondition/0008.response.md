The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the character `'>'`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and '>' has been printed.**
