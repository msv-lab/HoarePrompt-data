The provided code reads two long integers as strings, strips leading zeros, and then compares them to determine which is greater. Based on the problem description, the logic appears to be sound, as it correctly addresses the comparison of two non-negative integers while handling leading zeros.

1. **Input Handling**: The code uses `input().lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both integers. This is appropriate since the problem explicitly mentions that the integers may have leading zeros.

2. **Comparison Logic**: After stripping leading zeros, it checks for equality first; if they are equal, it prints `=`. If they are not equal, it uses string comparison to determine which one is greater or smaller, and prints the corresponding symbol.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles cases where both integers are zero (e.g., `0` and `00`).
   - It also handles leading zero cases like `00012345` and `12345`, resulting in an equality check that passes.
   - Another edge case, where both numbers are empty after stripping (which is theoretically possible if both inputs were just strings of zeros), is handled implicitly because an empty string as a result of stripping is not a valid non-negative integer input in this context.

4. **Output Hints**: The output hints confirm that the function compares the two integers after stripping leading zeros and correctly identifies their relationship (equal, less than, or greater than).

Based on the analysis, I can conclude that:

- The code adheres to the problem description and handles the mentioned edge cases properly.
- The output hints align with the behavior of the code.

Therefore, I find no examples where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
