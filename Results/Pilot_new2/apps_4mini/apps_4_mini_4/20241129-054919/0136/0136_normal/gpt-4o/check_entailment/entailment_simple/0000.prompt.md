You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".


-----Examples-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is the non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros. If `a` is '0', then `b` is `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. If `a` is not '0', the function does not alter `b` or `data`.
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros. If `a` is '0', then `b` is set to '0' and `data` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. If `a` is not '0', `b` and `data` remain unchanged.
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros, and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output '>' is printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output '=' is printed. If `a` is '0', then `b` is '0' and `data` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; if `a` is not '0', then `b` and `data` remain unchanged.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros, and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the output '<' is printed, and if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0' while `data` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output '>' is printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output '=' is printed. If `a` is '0', then `b` is '0' and `data` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; if `a` is not '0', then `b` and `data` remain unchanged.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is less than `b`, the output '<' is printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output '=' is printed. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output '>' is printed. Additionally, if `a` is '0', then `b` is set to '0' and `data` remains unchanged; if `a` is not '0', then `b` and `data` remain unchanged. The length of `a` is always greater than or equal to the length of `b`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output printed is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, then if `a` is less than `b`, the output '<' is printed; if `a` is equal to `b`, the output '=' is printed; and if `a` is greater than `b`, the output '>' is printed. Additionally, if `a` is '0', then `b` is set to '0' and `data` remains unchanged; if `a` is not '0', then `b` and `data` remain unchanged. The length of `a` is always greater than or equal to the length of `b`.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
