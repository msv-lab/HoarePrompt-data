Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description correctly for all cases. Specifically, the handling of leading zeroes is potentially problematic. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Leading Zeroes Handling**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeroes from both `a` and `b`, which is correct. However, it fails to handle the case when both strings are composed entirely of zeroes (e.g., "0000" and "0000"). After `lstrip`, both `a` and `b` would become empty strings, which the program then assigns to '0'. This is correct since both numbers are equal to zero, but in this case, it should return '='.

2. **Input Reading Method**: The problem explicitly states to avoid using `input()`. The program uses it, which is against the problem's requirement. The correct method for reading input should be `raw_input()` in Python 2 or an equivalent method to handle large inputs in Python 3.

3. **Output Requirements**: The program does follow the correct output logic of printing '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparisons after leading zeroes are removed. However, the combination of the input handling method and the leading zero logic could lead to incorrect cases if not carefully managed.

Due to these reasons, the program does not fully comply with the problem description and does not guarantee accurate results in all scenarios, particularly in edge cases where input may comprise entirely of zeroes or is formatted in a way that is not handled correctly.
