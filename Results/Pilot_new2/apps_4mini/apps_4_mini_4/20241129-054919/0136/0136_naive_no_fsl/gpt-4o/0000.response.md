Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into two large integers `a` and `b`, which is acceptable as per the problem description.

2. **Leading Zeros**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both integers, ensuring that comparisons are made on the actual values rather than their string representations with leading zeros. If the resulting string is empty (which happens if the number was all zeros), it assigns '0' back to `a` or `b`.

3. **Length Comparison**: It first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. This is a valid approach since a longer number (without leading zeros) is always greater than a shorter number.

4. **Lexicographical Comparison**: If both numbers are of equal length, it performs a lexicographical comparison, which is also appropriate for numeric strings of equal length.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the expected symbols '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparisons, following the required output format.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The program effectively handles the case where both numbers are zero, as it converts them to '0' after stripping leading zeros.
- It also correctly processes cases where either or both numbers are entirely made of zeros, ensuring correct output.

Since the program handles all outlined potential cases correctly and adheres to the problem description without any missing logic, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
