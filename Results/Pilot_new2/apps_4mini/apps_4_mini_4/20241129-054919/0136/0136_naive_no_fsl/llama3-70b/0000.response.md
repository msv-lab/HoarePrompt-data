Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle the case where both input integers `a` and `b` are zero. When both inputs are "0", the program will strip the leading zeros and consider `a` and `b` as empty strings, causing the comparison to be incorrect. It will erroneously evaluate as `a < b` since comparing two empty strings results in `False` for equality and an incorrect lexicographic comparison. 

For example:
Input:
```
0
0
```
Expected output: `=`
Actual output: `=` (correct), but if we input "000000" and "000000", it would still yield `=` which is correct, but we are missing the edge where no zeros at all or trailing zeros would need to be tested in a more concrete manner.

Although the logic for stripping leading zeros is present, the program does not account for the situation when the stripped versions of `a` and `b` end up being empty strings, which should be equal to "0". 

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
