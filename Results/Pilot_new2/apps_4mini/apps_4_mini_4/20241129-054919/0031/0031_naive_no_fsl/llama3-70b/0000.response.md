To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

**Understanding the Problem:**
The task is to compute the probability that at least two out of `k` people share the same birthday when there are `2^n` days available. The probability should be expressed as an irreducible fraction A/B, and both A and B should be printed modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

**Key Logic:**
1. If `k > total_days`, it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, so the probability is \(1\) (or \(\frac{1}{1}\)).
2. If `k <= total_days`, the probability of at least two people having the same birthday can be calculated via complementary counting. The number of ways `k` people can have unique birthdays can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Ways to choose unique birthdays} = (total\_days) \times (total\_days - 1) \times ... \times (total\_days - k + 1)
   \]
   The total ways of assigning birthdays without restriction is:
   \[
   (total\_days)^k
   \]
   The probability of unique birthdays is:
   \[
   P(\text{unique}) = \frac{(total\_days)(total\_days - 1)(total\_days - 2)...(total\_days - k + 1)}{(total\_days)^k}
   \]
   Thus, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is:
   \[
   P(\text{at least two share}) = 1 - P(\text{unique}) = 1 - \frac{(total\_days)(total\_days - 1)(total\_days - 2)...(total\_days - k + 1)}{(total\_days)^k}
   \]

**Reviewing the Code:**
The code implements the correct logic for when `k <= total_days` and handles `k > total_days` by returning the correct output for those cases. 

However, there are a few issues:
1. **Integer Overflow Risk**: Since `n` and `k` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), computing large factorial-like products can lead to integer overflow or performance issues. Python handles large integers, but the loop could run for very large `k`, making the computation impractical or inefficient.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD is calculated after multiplying the `numerator` and `denominator`, which is not optimal or necessary since we need to maintain their irreducibility throughout the calculations.

**Specific Case to Consider:**
1. **Case 1**: For `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the expected output should be `1 1` because with 2 days, at least two of the three people will share a birthday. The code handles this case correctly, returning `(1, 1)`.
2. **Case 2**: For `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the expected output should be `11 16`. The reasoning is that with 4 days, at least two of the 5 people must share a birthday, hence the output should be `1 1`. The calculation might yield incorrect results depending on integer handling in the product computations.

The main issue is that the program does not correctly handle the irreducibility aspect of the resulting fraction in all scenarios, especially for large `k`.

Given these considerations, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**
