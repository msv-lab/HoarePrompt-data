The `denominator` is updated by dividing it by `gcd`, which is previously calculated as the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. Since `denominator` is equal to \(2^{kn}\) and `gcd` is a divisor of `denominator`, the new value of `denominator` will be reduced. The values of `n`, `k`, `total_days`, and `numerator` remain unchanged during this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\); `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\); `denominator` is equal to \(2^{kn} // gcd\); `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`; `numerator` is updated to `numerator // gcd`.**
