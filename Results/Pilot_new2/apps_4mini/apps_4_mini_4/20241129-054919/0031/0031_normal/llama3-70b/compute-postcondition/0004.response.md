The variable `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\). The expression `total_days - i` will evaluate to \(2^n - 0 = 2^n\). Then, the value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying its current value (which is 1) by \(2^n\). Therefore, `numerator` becomes \(1 \times 2^n = 2^n\). The values of `denominator`, `i`, and `total_days` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is equal to \(2^n\`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0.**
