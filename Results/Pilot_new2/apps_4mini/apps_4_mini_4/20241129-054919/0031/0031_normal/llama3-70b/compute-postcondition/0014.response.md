The value of `numerator` is updated to be `numerator // gcd`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. The values of `n`, `k`, `total_days`, `denominator`, and `gcd` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `denominator` is equal to \(2^{kn}\), `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, and `numerator` is updated to `numerator // gcd`.**
