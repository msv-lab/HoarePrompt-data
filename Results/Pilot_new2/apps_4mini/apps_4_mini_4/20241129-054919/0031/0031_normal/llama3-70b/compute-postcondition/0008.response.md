The variable `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The value of `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\). Therefore, `denominator` becomes \(2^n \cdot (2^n)\).

The previous value of `denominator` was \(2^n\), and after the operation, it changes to \(2^n \cdot (2^n) = 2^{2n}\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is equal to \(2^n \cdot (2^n - 1)\), `denominator` is equal to \(2^{2n}\), `i` is 1**
