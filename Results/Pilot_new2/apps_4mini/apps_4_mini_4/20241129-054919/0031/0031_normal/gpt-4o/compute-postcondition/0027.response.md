The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. The function does not return any value (returns None). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, but does not produce any output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, and does not return any value.**
