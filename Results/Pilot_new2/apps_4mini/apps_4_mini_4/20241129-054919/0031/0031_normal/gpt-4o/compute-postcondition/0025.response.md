Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\)
- `MOD` is `1000003`
- `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\)
- `numerator` is the product of \((2^n - i) \mod 1000003\) for \(i\) in the range from \(0\) to \(k-1\)
- `denominator` is equal to \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)
- `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`
- `p_total` is equal to \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)
- `p_shared` is equal to \((p_total - numerator + 1000003) \mod 1000003\)
- `A` is equal to \(p_shared // g\)
- `B` is equal to \(p_total\)
- `g` is the result of `func_1(A, B)`

The line of code `B //= g` divides `B` by `g` using floor division.

Now, we analyze the impact:
- The value of `B` is updated to be equal to \(B // g\).
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `MOD`, `total_days`, `numerator`, `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, `A`, and `g`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is equal to 2^n, `numerator` is the product of (2^n - i) % 1000003 for i in the range from 0 to k-1, `denominator` is equal to (2^n)^k % 1000003, `p_no_shared` is equal to numerator, `p_total` is equal to (2^n)^k % 1000003, `p_shared` is equal to (p_total - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003, `A` is equal to p_shared // g, `B` is equal to p_total // g, `g` is the result of func_1(A, B).**
