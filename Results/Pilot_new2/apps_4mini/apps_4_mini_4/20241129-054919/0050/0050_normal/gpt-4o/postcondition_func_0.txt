The function accepts two lists of integers representing share prices and selling prices, along with three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r`. It determines whether purchases can be made based on the prices, and if so, calculates and prints the total amount of money obtained from selling the shares. If no shares can be bought or sold, it prints the value of `r`.
