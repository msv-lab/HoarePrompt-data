The function `func` accepts input for two lists representing the prices of shares and selling prices, as well as three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`. It calculates the minimum share price and maximum selling price from the given lists. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it simply prints the value of `r`, indicating that no shares can be bought. If buying is possible, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be purchased with the available funds (`r`), computes any remaining funds after the purchases, and then calculates the total money that can be received from selling these shares, which it prints. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of integers representing share prices and selling prices, along with three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r`. It determines whether purchases can be made based on the prices, and if so, calculates and prints the total amount of money obtained from selling the shares. If no shares can be bought or sold, it prints the value of `r`. **
