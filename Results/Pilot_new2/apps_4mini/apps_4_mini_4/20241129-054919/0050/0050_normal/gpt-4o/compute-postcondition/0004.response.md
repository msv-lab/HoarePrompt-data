The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from the list `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `min_buy_price` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` integers representing the prices of shares as entered by the user, `b` is a list of `m` integers created from user input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` integers representing the prices of shares as entered by the user, `b` is a list of `m` integers created from user input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`.**
