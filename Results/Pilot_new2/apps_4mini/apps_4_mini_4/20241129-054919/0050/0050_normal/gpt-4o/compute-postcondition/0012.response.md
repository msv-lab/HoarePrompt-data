Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, no shares can be bought or sold. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` when divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, with `total_bourles` being printed.***
