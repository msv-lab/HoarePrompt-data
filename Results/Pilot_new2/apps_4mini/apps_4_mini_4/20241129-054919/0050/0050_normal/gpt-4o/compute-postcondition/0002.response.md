The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate elements. The previous state of `b` is not available, but after the input is taken, `b` will hold a list of integers. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000); `s` is a list of `n` integers representing the prices of shares as entered by the user; `b` is a list of `m` integers created from user input.**
