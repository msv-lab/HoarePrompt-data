The variable `r` is updated by adding `shares * b[i]` to its previous value. The precondition states that `shares` is the total number of shares obtained using the original value of `r`, and `i` is the previous value incremented by 1. The variable `m` is greater than `previous i + 2`, but no specific changes are applied to it through this code snippet. 

Thus, the new value of `r` becomes `r + shares * b[i]`, while `shares`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`shares` is the total number of shares obtained using the original value of `r`, `i` is the previous value incremented by 1, `m` is greater than previous `i + 2`, and `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[i]`.**
