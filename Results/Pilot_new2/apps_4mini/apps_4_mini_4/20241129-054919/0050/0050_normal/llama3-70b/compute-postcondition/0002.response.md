`b` is assigned the list of integers obtained from input, created by mapping the input string to integers. The previous state of the variable `b` (prior to this code execution) is not defined, as it was an empty list or uninitialized. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input split into integers.**
