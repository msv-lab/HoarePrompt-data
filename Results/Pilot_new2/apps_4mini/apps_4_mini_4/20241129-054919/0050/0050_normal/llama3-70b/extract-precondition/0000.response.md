Precondition: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 30 and 1 <= m <= 30, r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 1000, s is a list of n integers where each s[i] (1 <= s[i] <= 1000) represents the price to buy shares, and b is a list of m integers where each b[i] (1 <= b[i] <= 1000) represents the price to sell shares.**
