The variable `s` is assigned a new value which is a list of integers generated by taking input, splitting it, and converting each part into an integer. The previous values of `s` will be replaced by this new list, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers obtained from input, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each `b[i]` (1 <= `b[i]` <= 1000).**
