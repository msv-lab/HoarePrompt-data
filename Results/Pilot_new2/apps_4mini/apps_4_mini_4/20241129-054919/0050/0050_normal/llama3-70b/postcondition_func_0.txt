The function accepts input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with two lists `s` and `b`, which represent share prices for buying and selling, respectively. It calculates the total number of shares that can be bought with the available funds `r`, updating it based on the selling prices from list `b`. It then prints the remaining value of `r` after the buying and selling process. If no shares can be bought, the original value of `r` remains unchanged. The function does not accept parameters directly and relies on user input.
