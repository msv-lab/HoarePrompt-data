The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is a positive integer, the expression `k * (k + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, but now we have a specific value for `min_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2.**
