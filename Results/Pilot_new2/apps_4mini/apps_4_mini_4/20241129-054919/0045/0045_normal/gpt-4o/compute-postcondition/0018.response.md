According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The variable `i` starts at `k - 1` and decreases with each iteration until it reaches -1, at which point the loop terminates. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be `k - 1`, and it has been decremented by 1 in the current iteration. Therefore, `i` will be `k - 2` for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute again, `k - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means that `k` must be at least 2. 

The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` must be at least 2, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1**.
