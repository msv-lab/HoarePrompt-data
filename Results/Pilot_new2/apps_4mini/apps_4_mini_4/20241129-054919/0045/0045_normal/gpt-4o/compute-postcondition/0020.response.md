Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, and `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is at least 2. If `remainder` equals 0, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 and `remainder` is decreased by 1, after which the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
