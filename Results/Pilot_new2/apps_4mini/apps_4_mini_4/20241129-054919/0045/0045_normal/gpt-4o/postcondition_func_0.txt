The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` distinct positive integers. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it computes a sequence of `k` integers where the first integer is the integer division of `n` by the minimum sum, and the remaining integers are incremented based on the remainder of that division. The function ultimately returns this modified sequence. If `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum, the sequence will consist of `k` equal integers.
