#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the sum n, b is a positive integer representing the count k, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The function implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD, which continues until `b` becomes 0. Therefore, it effectively handles cases where either or both inputs are large positive integers, but it does not account for negative or zero values for `a` or `b`, which may lead to incorrect behavior if input validation is needed.
