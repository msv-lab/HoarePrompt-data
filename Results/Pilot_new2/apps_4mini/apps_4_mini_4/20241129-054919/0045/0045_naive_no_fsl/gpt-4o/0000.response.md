To determine the correctness of the provided program, we first need to analyze the logic implemented in `func_1(n, k)`.

1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   The line `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2` calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers. This is correct because to form a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers, the smallest such sequence is `1, 2, ..., k`, which sums to this value.

2. **Checking Feasibility**:
   The condition `if min_sum > n:` checks if it is impossible to create such a sequence, returning `-1` if true. This is also correct.

3. **Finding the GCD**:
   The variable `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, which represents the maximum potential GCD of the sequence. 

4. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   The sequence is created by taking the first `k` positive integers multiplied by `d`: `sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`. This is appropriate because it ensures each element is divisible by `d`.

5. **Handling Remainder**:
   The subsequent loop adjusts the last elements of the sequence if there is any remainder after distributing `n` across `min_sum`, ensuring the total still sums to `n`.

### Testing Edge Cases
We will now reason through potential edge cases to see if the program fails:

**Case 1: Minimum Values**
- Input: `n = 1, k = 1`
- Expected Output: `1` (since we can form a sequence of one element which is just `1`)
- Actual Output: The program would correctly return `[1]`.

**Case 2: Unachievable Sequence**
- Input: `n = 5, k = 3`
- Expected Output: `-1` (the minimum sum is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is greater than `5`)
- Actual Output: The program correctly returns `-1`.

**Case 3: Large Inputs**
- Input: `n = 10^10, k = 10^5`
- We have `min_sum = 10^5 * (10^5 + 1) // 2`, which is approximately `5 * 10^9`, which is less than `10^10`, so valid. The program would perform the calculations and provide a valid output.

**Case 4: More General Test**
- Input: `n = 10, k = 4`
- Here, `min_sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`. The only sequence possible is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which sums to `10`.
- The program correctly returns this sequence.

### Conclusion
I couldn't find any input where the program fails to meet the problem requirements. The program correctly checks for the feasibility of forming the sequence, computes the necessary values, adjusts for any remainder, and meets the output requirements.

Correctness: **True**

The program handles edge cases correctly, and the logic aligns with the problem description.
