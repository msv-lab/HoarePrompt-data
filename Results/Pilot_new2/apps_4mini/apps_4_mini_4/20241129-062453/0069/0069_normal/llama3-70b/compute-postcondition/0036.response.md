The function `func` accepts several parameters based on the provided constraints. The parameters include:

1. `T`: a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq T \leq 100\).
2. For each test case:
   - `n`: an integer representing the length of the binary string, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `x`: an integer that can range from \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\).
   - `s`: a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

The function processes these inputs and produces output based on the logic defined within its body. Since the exact outputs are not specified, we cannot define those here. However, we can summarize the received parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer T (number of test cases), and for each test case, it accepts an integer n (length of a binary string), an integer x (within the range of -10^9 to 10^9), and a binary string s of length n.**
