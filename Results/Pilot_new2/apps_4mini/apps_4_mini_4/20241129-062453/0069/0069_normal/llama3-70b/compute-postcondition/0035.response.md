Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer for each iteration, `s` is a binary string of length `n` for each iteration, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1` for each iteration, and for each iteration, the printed output is determined by the relationship between `balance`, `x`, and `cnt0 - cnt1`. If at least one iteration occurs where `balance` equals `x`, then `n + 1` is printed. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the printed output is the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` for that iteration.**
