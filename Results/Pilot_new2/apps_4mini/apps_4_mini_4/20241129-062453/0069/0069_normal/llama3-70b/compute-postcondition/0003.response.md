The variable `s` is assigned the value from `input()`, which is a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1' and has a length of `n`. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged, but `s` now holds the input value. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`.**
