The code counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the binary string `s` and assigns them to the variables `cnt0` and `cnt1`, respectively. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` will depend on the specific contents of the string `s`, but they will always be non-negative integers. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`.**
