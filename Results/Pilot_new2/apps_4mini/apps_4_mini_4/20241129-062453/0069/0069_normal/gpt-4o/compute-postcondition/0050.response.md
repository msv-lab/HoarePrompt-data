The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0', otherwise minus 1. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` remains unchanged, and the conditions regarding `T`, `index`, `n`, `x`, and `prefix_balances` still hold true. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `index` is equal to `n + 7`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n + 7` must be less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 5])`, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except for `prefix_balances[n + 1]`.**
