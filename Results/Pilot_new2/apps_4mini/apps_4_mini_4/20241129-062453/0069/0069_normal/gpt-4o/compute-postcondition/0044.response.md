The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The initial state indicates that `index` is equal to `4 + (n + 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `n + 4`. After the increment, `index` becomes `n + 4 + 3`, which simplifies to `n + 7`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `index` is equal to `n + 7`, `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 5])`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `s` is equal to `data[n + 4]`.**
