The statement `results.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `results` will contain one element: `0`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `results` is a list containing 0, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the cumulative balance up to index `i`, the value of `x` is not present in the `prefix_balances` list, and the current value of `balance` is equal to 0.**
