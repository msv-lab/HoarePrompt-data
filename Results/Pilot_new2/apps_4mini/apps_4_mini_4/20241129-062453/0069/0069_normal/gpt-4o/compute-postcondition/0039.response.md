Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `4 + (n + 1) - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, if the `balance` is equal to 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains `-1`; otherwise, `results` is a list containing 0. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` now contains the previous elements plus the current value of `count`, where `count` is the number of valid `b` values in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0. The `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the cumulative balance up to index `i`.***
