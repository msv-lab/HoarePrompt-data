The code initializes an empty list called `results`. None of the previously defined variables (`T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `data`, `index`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state retains all information about those variables as they were before execution.

Output State: **`T` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings derived from the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
