Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the cumulative balance up to index `i`. The value of `x` is not present in the `prefix_balances` list. The current value of `balance` is equal to 0.***
