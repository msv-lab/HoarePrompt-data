The value of `prefix_balances` is assigned a new list consisting of `0` repeated `n + 1` times. The other variables retain their previous values without change. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `prefix_balances`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeroes, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`.**
