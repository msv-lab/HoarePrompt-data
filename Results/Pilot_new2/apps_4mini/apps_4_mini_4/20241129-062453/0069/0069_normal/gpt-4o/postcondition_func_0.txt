The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a binary string and performs calculations based on the balance of '0's and '1's in the string. It determines if the target value `x` can be reached using a certain number of transformations based on the computed balance and returns the count of valid transformations for each case. If the total balance is zero and `x` is found in the prefix balances, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns 0. If the balance is not zero, it calculates how many transformations can reach `x` and returns that count. The function does not accept parameters and directly prints results for all test cases.
