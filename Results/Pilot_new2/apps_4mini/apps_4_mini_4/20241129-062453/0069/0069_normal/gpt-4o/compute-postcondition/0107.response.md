Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list, `s` produces a non-empty `prefix_balances`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `b` is the last element in `prefix_balances`.**
