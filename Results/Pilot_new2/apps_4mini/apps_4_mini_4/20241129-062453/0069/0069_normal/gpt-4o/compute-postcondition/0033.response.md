Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` must have at least 5 elements. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is updated to the previous value of `count + 1`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
