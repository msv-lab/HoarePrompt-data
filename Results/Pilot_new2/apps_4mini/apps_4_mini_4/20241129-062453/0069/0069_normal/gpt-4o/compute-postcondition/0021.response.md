The code `results.append(-1)` adds `-1` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged as this operation does not affect them.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `results` now contains `-1`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the cumulative balance up to index `i`, the current value of `balance` is equal to 0, and the value of `x` is present in `prefix_balances`.**
