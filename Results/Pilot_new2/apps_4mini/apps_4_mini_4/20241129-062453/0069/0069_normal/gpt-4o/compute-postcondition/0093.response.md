The code `results.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `results`. No other variables in the initial state are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state, with the only change being the addition of `0` to `results`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, `prefix_balances` is updated such that `prefix_balances[i]` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from `s`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, the current value of `balance` is 0, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, and `0` has been appended to `results`.**
