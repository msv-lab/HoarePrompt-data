Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` now contains `-1`. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing 0. The `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the cumulative balance up to index `i`, with the current value of `balance` remaining equal to 0.***
