To evaluate the Python program, let's analyze the logic based on the problem description. 

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Apartment Calculation**:
   - Apartments are numbered from 1 to \( n \times m \times k \).
   - The building has \( n \) entrances (blocks), each with \( m \) floors, and each floor has \( k \) apartments.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - Time to move between floors is 5 seconds (via stairs) and 1 second (via elevator).
   - Time taken for the elevator to arrive is 10 seconds.
   - Moving between adjacent entrances takes 15 seconds.
   - Moving from the entrance door to the first floor happens instantly.

3. **Input and Output**:
   - The function needs to determine the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha from their respective apartments.

### Analyzing the Code

The function `func_1` is structured as follows:

1. **Getting Location**:
   - The function `get_location` determines the block (entrance) and floor based on the apartment number.
   
2. **Time Calculation Logic**:
   - It checks if Edward is already on the first floor and calculates the time to exit accordingly.
   - It computes the direct and reverse walking time between entrances.
   - It calculates the time needed to go to Natasha's floor after reaching her entrance.
   
3. **Return Value**:
   - The total calculated time is returned as the result.

### Identifying Edge Cases

Now, let's find potential edge cases where the code may not perform as expected:

1. **Same Floor**:
   - If Edward and Natasha live in the same entrance but different apartments on the same floor, the program should determine that no time is needed for vertical movement. The walking time between apartments should be calculated effectively. This is not explicitly checked in the code.

2. **First Floor Movement**:
   - If Edward is on the first floor of his entrance, the current logic does not correctly handle the case of needing to go to a different entrance which might also be on the first floor.

3. **Edge Cases with Different Entrances**:
   - When Edward needs to move to a different entrance that is further away (e.g., jumping between entrances when one is at the last entrance and the other at the first) needs to be checked for both direct and reverse paths effectively.
   
4. **Maximum Values**:
   - The function might not handle very large values of \( n, m, k \) efficiently, particularly if the calculations lead to unexpected results due to arithmetic overflow or incorrect modulo calculations.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and its potential edge cases, I found that the program does not handle the case when both Edward and Natasha are in the same entrance but on different apartments effectively. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
