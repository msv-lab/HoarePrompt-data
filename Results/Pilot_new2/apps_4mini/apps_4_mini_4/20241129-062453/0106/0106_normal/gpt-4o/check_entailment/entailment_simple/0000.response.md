To determine the correctness of the provided Python program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in both `func_1` and `get_location`.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. **House Structure**: There are `n` entrances, each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments.
2. **Apartment Numbering**: Apartments are numbered sequentially across entrances and floors.
3. **Movement Costs**:
   - Going from the top of the entrance to the first floor via elevator takes 10 seconds (waiting) + 1 second per floor (e.g., 10 seconds wait + x seconds for the journey).
   - Walking between entrances takes 15 seconds.
   - Moving between floors takes 5 seconds per floor.
4. **Objective**: Calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment given their respective apartment numbers.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **`get_location` Function**:
   - The function correctly computes the entrance (block) and floor number for a given apartment number.
   - It divides the apartment number to determine the entrance and the relative floor correctly, thus fulfilling its purpose.

2. **`func_1` Function**:
   - Computes the time Edward needs to exit his entrance based on his floor.
   - Calculates the walking time between entrances both clockwise and counterclockwise and properly takes the minimum of the two.
   - Computes the time to reach the target floor based on the difference in floors multiplied by the time per floor (5 seconds).
   - Adds all the computed times together to return the total travel time.

### Potential Issues:
- The calculation for `time_to_exit` when Edward is not on the first floor is incorrectly described in the annotated program. The comment states `9 + floor_a`, but according to the problem description, it should be `10 + (floor_a - 1)` seconds for waiting plus the seconds for traveling down (where `floor_a - 1` is the number of floors to go down).
- The calculation for `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` should account for the circular nature of the entrances correctly, which it seems to do by using modulo operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement except for the time calculation for exiting the entrance which does not align with the description provided. This crucial detail results in the function potentially returning incorrect timings for certain inputs.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements as stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
