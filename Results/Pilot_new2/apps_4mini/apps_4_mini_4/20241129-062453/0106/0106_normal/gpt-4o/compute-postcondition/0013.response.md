The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. Parameters `a` and `b` are distinct integers constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The function returns the total time which is calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return the total time based on the calculated components involving these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers), a, and b (distinct integers), and returns the total time based on the sum of various calculated time components.**
