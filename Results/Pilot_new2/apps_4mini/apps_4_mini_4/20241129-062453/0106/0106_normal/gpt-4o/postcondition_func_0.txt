The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, alongside two distinct integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the total time required to move from the location represented by `a` to the location represented by `b`, considering the exit time from the floor of `a`, the walking time between the blocks, and the time to reach the target floor associated with `b`. The function returns the computed total time based on these calculations.
