Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment` and returns a tuple containing the `block` and `floor` corresponding to the given apartment number. The `block` is determined by the integer division of `apartment - 1` by the product of `m` and `k`, while the `floor` is calculated based on the remainder of the division of `apartment - 1` by `m * k`, further divided by `k`. The function does not handle cases where `apartment` falls outside the valid range defined by `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k`, which could lead to unexpected results if those conditions are violated.**
