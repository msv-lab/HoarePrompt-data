Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we can analyze the impact on the variables step by step.

Initial State: 
- `n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned based on input values.
- `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and `n·m·k`, with `a` ≠ `b`.
- `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`
- `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`
- `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
- `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
- `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the values of `a_floor` and `b_floor`.
- `min_block_time` is defined based on `a_block` and `b_block`.

The code:
```
print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

Now, we can assess the output state:

1. The calculation of `min_floor_time` will depend on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`.
   - If `a_floor > b_floor`, then `min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`.
   - Otherwise, `min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.

2. The value of `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.

3. The print statement will output the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we cannot calculate exact numeric results for `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. However, their definitions remain valid.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned based on input values; `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and `n·m·k`, with `a` ≠ `b`; `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_floor_time` is either `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` or `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`; `min_block_time` is `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. Value of `min_block_time + min_floor_time` has been printed.**
