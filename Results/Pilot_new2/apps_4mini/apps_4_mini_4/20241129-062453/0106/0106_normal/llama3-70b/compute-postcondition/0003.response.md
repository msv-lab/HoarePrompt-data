The value of `a_block` is assigned the value of the expression `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. Given that `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`, the impact of the code is that `a_block` will represent the block number in a division of the range `1` to `n·m·k` based on the volume defined by `m * k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned new integer values based on input; `a` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer between 1 and `n·m·k`; `a` ≠ `b`; `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
