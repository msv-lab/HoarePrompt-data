The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is 3, so the new value of `m` becomes 4. The values of `n` and `i` are unaffected, with `n` still greater than 2 and `i` still equal to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `m` is 4, `i` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `m` is 4, `i` is equal to `n**
