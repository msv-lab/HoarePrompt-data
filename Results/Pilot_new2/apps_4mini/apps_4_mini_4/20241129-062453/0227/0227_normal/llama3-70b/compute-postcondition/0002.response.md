The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is only the order of the elements in `a` that changes. The values of `a_k` will now be in sorted order, but they will still satisfy the constraints of being distinct positive integers within the given range. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of `a` after sorting.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_k` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_k` ≤ 10^9.**
