The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and now includes `a[2]`, `i` is 3, `can_form` is True, `assigned` must not be empty, and the expression `(a[i] - x)` is found in `assigned`.
