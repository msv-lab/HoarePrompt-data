The value of `can_form` is assigned `False`. Since it was already `False`, its value remains the same. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` now includes `a[1]`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` remains `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` now includes `a[1]`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is False.**
