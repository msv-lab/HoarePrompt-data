The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is True, with the difference (a[i] - x) being an element in `assigned`.
