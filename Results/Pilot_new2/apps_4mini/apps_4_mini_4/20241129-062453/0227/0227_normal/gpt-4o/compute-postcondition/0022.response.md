Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least one element from `a`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is set to 2, `i` remains 1, and there exists no `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`.***
