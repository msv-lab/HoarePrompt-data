Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is True if there exists any `x` in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains False.**
