#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and a is a list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a[k] (1 ≤ k ≤ n) satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes all elements in `a`, `m` is the count of distinct integers that could not be formed by pairs in `assigned`.
    return m
    #The program returns the count of distinct integers that could not be formed by pairs in the list 'assigned', which includes all elements in the sorted list 'a' containing 'n' distinct positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list and counts how many integers in the list cannot be formed as the difference of any two integers in the list. The function returns this count, which represents the number of distinct integers that could not be formed by pairs in the list.
