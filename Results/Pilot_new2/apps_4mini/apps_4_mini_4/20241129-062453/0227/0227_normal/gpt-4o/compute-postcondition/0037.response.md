The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and at least one more element, `i` is 2, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, `assigned` must include at least one more element beyond the current `x`, `can_form` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
