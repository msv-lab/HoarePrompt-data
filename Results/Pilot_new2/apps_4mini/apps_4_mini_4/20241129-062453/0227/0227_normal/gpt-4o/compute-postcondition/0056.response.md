The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and `a[2]`, `x` is the next element in the `assigned` list, and `can_form` is True.
