Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and `a[2]`, `i` is 3, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, and `assigned` must not be empty. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, the state remains unchanged.***
