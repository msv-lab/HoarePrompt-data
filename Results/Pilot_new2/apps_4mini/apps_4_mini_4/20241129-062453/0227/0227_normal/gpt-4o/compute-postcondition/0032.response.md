`can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and at least one more element, `i` is 2, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True.
