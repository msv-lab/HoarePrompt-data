The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects that `can_form` has been updated while keeping the existing conditions about `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, and the relationship involving `a[i] - x` in the set `assigned`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing the value `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, and the value of `a[i] - x` is in the set `assigned`.**
