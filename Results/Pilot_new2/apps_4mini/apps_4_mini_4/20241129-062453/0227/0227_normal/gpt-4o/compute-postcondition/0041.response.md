The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is unknown, and since it is not provided in the initial state, we can only indicate that it has been increased. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]`, `i` is 2, `can_form` is False, and `m` is increased by 1.**
