Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and at least one more element, `i` is 2, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, if the difference `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
