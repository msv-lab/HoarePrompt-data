To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to consider the requirements closely.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have a sequence of distinct positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2. We need to determine the minimum number of variables `m` such that we can perform operations defined in the problem (starting with `b_1` equal to `a_1`, and subsequent operations forming sums of two `b` variables).
3. If it's impossible to execute the operations with any `m`, the result should be `-1`.

### Examining the Program:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
a.sort()
m = 1
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2:
        m += 1
print(m if m <= 23 else -1)
```

1. The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
2. It sorts the list `a`.
3. It initializes `m` to 1 and increments `m` whenever an element in `a` is not double the previous one.
4. Finally, it prints `m`, but limits it to a maximum of 23 by returning `-1` if `m` exceeds 23.

### Issues Identified:
1. The condition `if a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2:` is incorrect for determining if a new variable is needed. The logic fails to take into account whether the operations can actually be performed to produce the required sums.
   - For instance, consider the input:
     ```
     3
     1 3 5
     ```
     The sorted list is `[1, 3, 5]`. The program would increment `m` for both `3` and `5`, leading to `m = 3`, which does not account for the fact that `5` cannot be achieved from `1` and `3` through summation operations of previously stored values.
2. The output `-1` only happens when `m` surpasses 23. It fails to check for cases where it's impossible to reach a specific number in the sequence.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified logic flaw where the program does not properly account for the feasibility of constructing the sequence with the defined variable assignments, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all cases. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of variables `m`, as seen with the provided counterexample.
