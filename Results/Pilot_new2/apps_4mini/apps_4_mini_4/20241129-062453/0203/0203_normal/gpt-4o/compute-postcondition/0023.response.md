The value of `d_index` is appended to `d_queue` after adding `n` to it. The value of `d_index` is less than `r_index`, and since `n` is a positive integer within the range [1, 200000], the new value being added to `d_queue` will be greater than the current value of `d_index`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_queue` now contains the value `d_index + n` appended to it; `r_queue` has one less element; `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of the original `d_queue`; `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`; and `d_index` is less than `r_index`.**
