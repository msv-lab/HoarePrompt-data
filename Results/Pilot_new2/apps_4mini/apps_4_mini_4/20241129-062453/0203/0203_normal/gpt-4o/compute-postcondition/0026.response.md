Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` now contains the value `d_index + n` appended to it, while `r_queue` has one less element and `d_index` remains less than `r_index`. Otherwise, `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` has one more element equal to `r_index + n`, and `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index` with both `d_index` and `r_index` retaining their original values.***
