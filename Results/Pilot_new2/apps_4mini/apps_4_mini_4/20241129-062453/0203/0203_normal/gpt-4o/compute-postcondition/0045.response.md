The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and the parameter `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', representing the fractions of the `n` employees where 'D' denotes depublicans and 'R' denotes remocrats. After executing the function body, it processes the input data and produces an output based on the distribution of 'D' and 'R' characters in the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a string s of length n consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters, and returns a result based on the distribution of the characters in s.**
