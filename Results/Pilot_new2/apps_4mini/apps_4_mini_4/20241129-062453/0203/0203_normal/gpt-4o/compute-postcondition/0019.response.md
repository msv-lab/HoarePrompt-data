According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on both `d_queue` and `r_queue`. For the loop to execute, both queues must contain at least one element each. 

Currently, it is stated that:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000,
- `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R',
- `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes`,
- `r_queue` contains the indices of all 'R' characters in `votes`.

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ascertain that there is at least one 'D' and one 'R' in the `votes` string.

If either `d_queue` or `r_queue` is empty, the state must be adjusted accordingly. Given that `votes` is constructed from 'D' and 'R', it is necessary to ensure that both are present at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_queue` must not be empty; `r_queue` must not be empty**
