The value of `d_index` is assigned the first element from `d_queue`, which is removed from the queue. Since `d_queue` cannot be empty based on the preconditions given (if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`), we can confirm that there was at least one element in `d_queue` before the operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `r_queue` must contain at least 2 elements; if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `d_queue` is not empty; `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue`, and `d_queue` now has one less element.**
