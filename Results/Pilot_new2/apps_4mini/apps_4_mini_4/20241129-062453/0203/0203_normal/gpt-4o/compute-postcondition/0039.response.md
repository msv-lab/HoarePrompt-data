Output State: **`d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` is empty; if `votes` contained at least one 'D' and one 'R', then each 'D' and 'R' has competed against each other until they are exhausted, with the final `d_index` and `r_index` being the last indices that were compared before the queues were emptied. If `n` is the original number of votes, then all elements in `votes` have been processed.**
