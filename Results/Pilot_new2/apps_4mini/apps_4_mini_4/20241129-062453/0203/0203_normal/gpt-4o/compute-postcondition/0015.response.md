The value of `i` is updated to be `i + 1`, and then `d_queue` is updated by appending the new value of `i`. The other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `d_queue` now includes `i + 1` as a new element.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `d_queue` includes at least `i + 1` elements, with `i + 1` appended to it.**
