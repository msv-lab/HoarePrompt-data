The variable `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` and is removed from it. The states of the other variables are not affected, but we note that `r_index` is now equal to the first element that was in `r_queue` before the pop operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue` and removed from it; `r_index` is now equal to the first element that was in `r_queue` before it was popped.**
