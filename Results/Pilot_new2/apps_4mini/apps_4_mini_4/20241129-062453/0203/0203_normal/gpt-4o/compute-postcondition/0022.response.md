Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_queue` is now empty; `r_queue` has one less element; `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of the original `d_queue`; `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`. The current value of `d_index` is less than the current value of `r_index`.***
