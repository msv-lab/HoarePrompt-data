The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `fractions` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0**.
