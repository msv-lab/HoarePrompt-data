The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, and `fractions` still has at least one remaining character. The state of `remocrats` is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` has at least one remaining character, `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains unchanged.**
