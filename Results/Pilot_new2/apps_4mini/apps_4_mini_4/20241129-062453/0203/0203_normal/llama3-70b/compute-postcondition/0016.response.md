The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The state of the other variables, `n` and `fractions`, remains unchanged, but the specific value of `remocrats` is now one greater than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` has at least one remaining character, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` has at least one remaining character, `remocrats` is increased by 1**.
