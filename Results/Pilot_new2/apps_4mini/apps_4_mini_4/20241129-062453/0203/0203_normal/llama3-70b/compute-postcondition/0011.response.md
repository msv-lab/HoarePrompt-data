`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions about `n`, `fractions`, and `remocrats` still hold true after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` must have remaining characters after `fraction`, `depublicans` is updated to `depublicans + 1`, `remocrats` is updated accordingly.**
