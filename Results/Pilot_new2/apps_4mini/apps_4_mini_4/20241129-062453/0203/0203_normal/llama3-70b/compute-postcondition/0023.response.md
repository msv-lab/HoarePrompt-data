Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, if the count of 'D' characters (`depublicans`) is greater than the count of characters that are not 'D' (`remocrats`), then 'D' has been printed. Otherwise, the count of 'D' characters is less than or equal to the count of characters that are not 'D'.***
