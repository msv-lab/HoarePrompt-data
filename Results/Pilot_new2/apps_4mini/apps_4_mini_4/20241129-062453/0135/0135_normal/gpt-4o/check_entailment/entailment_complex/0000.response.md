To determine whether the provided Python program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to check if all remainders of dividing a number \( n \) by every integer \( i \) from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that there are no two distinct integers \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i < j \leq k \)) such that \( n \mod i = n \mod j \).

### Program Analysis
Let's analyze the program:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \) and returns 'No' if this condition is true. This is important because if \( k \geq n \), then there will be remainders that could potentially be the same due to the mathematical properties of modulo operation (for example, \( n \mod n = 0 \) and \( n \mod 1 = 0 \)).
   
2. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The function initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to store unique remainders.
   - It iterates over each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder \( n \mod i \).
   - If a remainder has already been seen (exists in `seen_remainders`), it returns 'No'.
   - If the remainder is new, it adds it to the set.

3. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.

### Correctness Evaluation
We need to confirm that the program handles the following scenarios correctly:
- When \( k \) is equal to or greater than \( n \), it returns 'No' as expected.
- When \( k \) is less than \( n \), it accurately calculates and checks for duplicate remainders.

This program efficiently checks for duplicates using a set, which allows for average O(1) time complexity for both checking membership and adding new items. 

### Conclusion
The program adheres strictly to the problem description. It correctly handles all specified cases, including the edge case of \( k \geq n \) and ensuring that all remainders from \( n \mod 1 \) to \( n \mod k \) are distinct.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
