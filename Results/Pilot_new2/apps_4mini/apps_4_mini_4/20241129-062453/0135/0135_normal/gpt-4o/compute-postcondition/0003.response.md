The variable `seen_remainders` is initialized as an empty set. The initial states of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and k is less than n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and k is less than n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set.**
