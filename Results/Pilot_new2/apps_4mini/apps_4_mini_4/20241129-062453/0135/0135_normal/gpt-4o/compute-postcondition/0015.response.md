According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is at least 2. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 3 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k ≥ 3, `seen_remainders` now includes 0, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is 0.**
