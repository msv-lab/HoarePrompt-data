The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, both of which must be greater than or equal to 1 and at most \(10^{18}\). The function first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`; if so, it immediately returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, the function computes the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. It keeps track of these remainders in a set called `seen_remainders`.

During this computation, if a remainder is found that has already been recorded in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without encountering any duplicate remainders, the function returns 'Yes'. 

The edge cases to consider include:
- The case when `k` is equal to `n`, where the function will return 'No'.
- If `k` is less than `n`, the function may return 'No' if any remainders are duplicated or 'Yes' if all remainders are unique.
- The function does not handle cases where `n` or `k` are less than 1, as per the provided constraints.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, returning 'No' if it is. It then calculates the unique remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, returning 'No' if any remainder is duplicated, and 'Yes' if all remainders are unique. **
