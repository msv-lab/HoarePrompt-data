The code `seen_remainders.add(remainder)` adds the current value of `remainder` to the `seen_remainders` set. Since `remainder` is specified to not be in `seen_remainders`, it will now be included in the set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k < n, `seen_remainders` contains `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`.**
