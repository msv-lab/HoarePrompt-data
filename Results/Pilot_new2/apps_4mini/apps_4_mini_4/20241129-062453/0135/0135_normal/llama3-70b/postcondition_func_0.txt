The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, read from standard input. It checks if all remainders of `n` when divided by integers from 1 to `k` are unique. If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any values.
