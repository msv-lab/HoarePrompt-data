The operation `seen.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Since `remainder` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a variable that is in context and can possibly take a value that is not currently present in `seen`. After executing this code, `seen` will now contain the original values plus the new value of `remainder`. The impact on the variables is specifically on the `seen` set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing 0, 1, and `remainder`.**
