To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the behavior of the loop code.

1. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, so it will execute `k` times if `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. During each iteration, the `remainder` is calculated as `n % i`, and this value is checked against the `seen` set.
3. If the `remainder` is already present in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. This indicates that there are duplicates in the remainders computed, which can happen if certain values of `n` produce the same remainder upon division by different `i`.
4. If the loop executes fully (meaning it does not exit early), all unique remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k` are added to the `seen` set.

Now we can consider two scenarios: when the loop executes at least once and when it does not execute at all.

- If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute.
- If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains empty.

After the loop executes completely:

- The `seen` set contains all unique remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k`.
- The final value of `i` will be `k + 1` (as the loop ends after reaching `k`).
- The `remainder` will be equal to `n % k` (the last computed value before the loop completes).

Given this reasoning, we can summarize the output state after all iterations of the loop:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `seen` is a set containing all unique remainders from `n % 1` to `n % k`, and `remainder` is equal to `n % k`.**
