To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem requires checking if all remainders produced by `n mod i` for `1 ≤ i ≤ k` are distinct. 

The provided program is as follows:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
seen = set()
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    remainder = n % i
    if remainder in seen:
        print('No')
        exit()
    seen.add(remainder)
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Format**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`, which is appropriate according to the problem description.
  
2. **Loop from 1 to k**: The loop iterates through each integer from `1` to `k`, which matches the requirement to check all integers in that range.

3. **Calculating Remainders**: For each integer `i`, it calculates `n % i` which correctly computes the remainder when `n` is divided by `i`.

4. **Checking for Distinctness**: 
   - A set called `seen` is used to keep track of all observed remainders.
   - If a remainder is found in the set, it prints 'No' and exits, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If a remainder is not found, it adds the remainder to the set.
   
5. **Returning Yes/No**: After checking all integers, if no duplicates are found, it prints 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases:

Let's consider edge cases particularly concerning the bounds of `n` and `k` (up to `10^18`):
- For `n = 1` and `k = 1`: The remainder `1 % 1` is `0`. This case will correctly return 'Yes' since there is only one remainder.
- For `n = 2` and `k = 2`: The remainders are `2 % 1 = 0` and `2 % 2 = 0`. This will correctly return 'No' as both remainders are the same.
- For large values, e.g., `n = 10^18` and `k = 10^18`: The program would attempt to compute remainders from `1` to `10^18`, which is computationally infeasible due to time constraints.

### Problematic Cases:
The critical flaw occurs when `k` is greater than `n`. Specifically, when `k > n`, the remainders calculated for `i > n` will always be `n % i = n` until `i` reaches `n`, after which the remainders will start to repeat as `i` increases, leading to non-distinct values.

For example:
- If we take `n = 5` and `k = 10`, the program will calculate remainders:
  - `5 % 1 = 0`
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 3 = 2`
  - `5 % 4 = 1` (duplicate)
  - `5 % 5 = 0` (duplicate)
  - `5 % 6 = 5`
  - ...
  - This will cause it to incorrectly output 'Yes' when it should output 'No'.

Thus, we can conclude that the program does not handle the case where `k > n`, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly identify distinct remainders when `k` is greater than `n`, as shown in the problematic cases.
