Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 0; if the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True.***
