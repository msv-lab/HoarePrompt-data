The code `color_counts[color] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `color` in the dictionary `color_counts` by 1. Since `color_counts` has the key `color` with a value of 0 if it wasn't previously present, the new value for `color_counts[color]` will be 1 after this increment. The values of `n`, `m`, `counts`, and the `colors` list remain unaffected, as they are not manipulated by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, `color_counts` has the key `color` with a value equal to 1, and the `colors` list must contain at least 3 elements.**
