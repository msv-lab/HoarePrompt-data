The value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The previous state shows that `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, where `j` is `i + 1`. Since `color` was not in `window_counts`, it had an initial value of 0, and after the increment, it will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`found` is true, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `color` is `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1**.
