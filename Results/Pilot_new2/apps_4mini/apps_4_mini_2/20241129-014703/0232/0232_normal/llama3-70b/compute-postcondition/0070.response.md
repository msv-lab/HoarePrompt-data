Postcondition: ***`colors` contains at least 3 elements, `color` is the element at index 2 of `colors`, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and if all color counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
