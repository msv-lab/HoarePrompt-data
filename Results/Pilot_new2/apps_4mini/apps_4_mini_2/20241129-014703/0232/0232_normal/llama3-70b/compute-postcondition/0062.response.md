Postcondition: ***`colors` is either empty or contains elements; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors; `found` is True; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `window_counts[color]` is 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution without breaking.***
