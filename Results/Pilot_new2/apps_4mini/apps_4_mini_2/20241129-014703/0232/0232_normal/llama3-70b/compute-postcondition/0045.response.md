The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is either empty or contains elements, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
