Postcondition: ***`colors` is either empty or contains elements; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors; `found` is True; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `color` is the element at index `j` of `colors`; `window_counts[color]` is now equal to the previous value of `window_counts[color] + 1; all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, meaning the sorted values of `window_counts` equal the sorted values of `counts`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited successfully.***
