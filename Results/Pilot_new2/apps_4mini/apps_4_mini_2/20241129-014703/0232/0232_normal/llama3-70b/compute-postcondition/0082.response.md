Postcondition: ***If `found` is true, then `colors` remains either empty or contains elements, `color_counts` may be an empty dictionary or contain counts of colors, `found` indicates that the color counts matched the `counts`, `n` remains greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, and `window_counts` contains counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[n-1]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
