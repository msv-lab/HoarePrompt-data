The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is either empty or contains elements; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors; `found` is True; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `color` is the element at index `j` of `colors`; `window_counts[color]` is now equal to the previous value of `window_counts[color] + 1; all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, meaning that when sorted, the values of `window_counts` equal the sorted values of `counts` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
