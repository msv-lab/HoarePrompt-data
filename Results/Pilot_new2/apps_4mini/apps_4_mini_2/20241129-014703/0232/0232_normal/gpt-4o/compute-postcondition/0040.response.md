Output State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` plus the number of iterations executed, `current_counts` indicates that all `current_counts[color]` are now equal to `desired_counts[color]` for every color, `right` is `n`. If `current_counts` initially indicated that at least one `current_counts[color]` was less than `desired_counts[color]`, then the loop executed until the condition was met.**
