The variable `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was the initial value of `left` plus the number of iterations executed plus 2; therefore, after the increment, the new value of `left` becomes the initial value of `left` plus the number of iterations executed plus 3. The state of `current_counts[colors[left]]` remains decreased by 1, and both `current_counts` and `desired_counts` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` plus the number of iterations executed plus 3; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1; `current_counts` and `desired_counts` remain unchanged.**
