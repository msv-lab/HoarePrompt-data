`current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1. The initial state indicates that `current_counts[color]` values for at least one color are still less than the corresponding `desired_counts[color]`, and `right` is `n`. After this operation, the value of `current_counts[colors[left]]` will be one less than its previous value, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is equal to the number of iterations executed, `current_counts` still indicates that at least one `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]`, `right` is n, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`left` is equal to the number of iterations executed, `current_counts` still indicates that at least one `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]`, `right` is n, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1**.
