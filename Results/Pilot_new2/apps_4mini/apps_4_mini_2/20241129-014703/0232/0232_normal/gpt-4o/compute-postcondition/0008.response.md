Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `current_counts[color]` must be greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]` for all colors in `desired_counts`, and it is not the case that `current_counts[color]` equals `desired_counts[color]` for all colors in `desired_counts`.***
