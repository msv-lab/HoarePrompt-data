Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the rounding logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in the handling of the case when `n % 10 > 5`. The program currently prints `10` in that case, which is incorrect. 

According to the problem description, if `n` is a non-negative integer that does not end in 0 and `n % 10 > 5`, it should round to the nearest integer that ends with 0, which would be `n + (10 - n % 10)`. However, the program's logic wrongly reduces the output to just printing `10`, which is not correct for any `n` greater than 10.

For instance, if `n = 15`, the program will output `10`, which is not the nearest multiple of 10. The correct output should be `20`.

This failure to correctly round in all scenarios shows that the program does not adhere to the requirements laid out in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
