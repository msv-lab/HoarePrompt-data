`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Given that `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`, it must be a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and also less than or equal to 5. As a result, `result` will be a non-negative integer since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` can only subtract values from `n` that are between 0 and 5. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `remainder` is equal to `n % 10` (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive) and is less than or equal to 5; `result` is equal to `n - remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `remainder` is equal to `n % 10` (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive) and is less than or equal to 5; `result` is equal to `n - remainder`.**
