The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which converts user input into an integer. The initial condition states that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The value of `n` will now depend on the specific integer input provided by the user, but it will still fall within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\; (updated to the integer input value).**
