The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. The parameter `s` is a string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000. The parameter `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits that may contain leading zeroes. The function returns the integer representation of the string `n`, which is formed by concatenating characters from `s` that are also in `t` with the string `t`. If `s` is empty, the value of `n` becomes equal to `t`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, returns the integer representation of a string `n` formed by concatenating characters from `s` that are also in `t` with `t`, or just `t` if `s` is empty.**
