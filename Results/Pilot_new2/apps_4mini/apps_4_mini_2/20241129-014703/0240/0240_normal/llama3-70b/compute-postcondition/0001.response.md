The variable `n` is assigned an empty string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits that may contain leading zeroes; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`; `n` is an empty string.
