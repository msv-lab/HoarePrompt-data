To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description and annotations, let's analyze the code and its logic carefully.

### Problem Description
Vasya appends the number of digits in `n` (denoted as `k`) to `n` itself, and this results in a string `s`. Given this string `s` and a remembered substring of `n` (denoted as `sub`), the task is to find the smallest possible integer `n`.

### Function Analysis
1. **Function 1: `func_1(s, sub)`**
   - The function calculates the difference in length between `s` and `sub` to determine `n_len`.
   - It then uses `Counter` to track character frequencies in both `s` and `sub`, subtracting the frequencies of `sub` from `s`.
   - After subtracting, it generates all possible numbers (permutations of remaining characters with `sub`) and returns the smallest valid integer.
   - A potential edge case arises if there are no remaining characters after subtraction, which could lead to an error when trying to compute the minimum.

2. **Function 2: `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)`**
   - It checks if `sub` is a substring of `num_str` and validates if the length of `num_str` matches `n_len`.
   - However, the annotation states that it does not validate the length properly, always returning `True` regardless of the length mismatch.

3. **Function 3: `generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub)`**
   - It generates permutations of `chars`, checking each permutation against the `is_valid_number` function.
   - If no valid permutations exist, it yields no values which could also lead to issues when determining the smallest number.

### Key Issues Identified
- **Invalid Length Check**: In `is_valid_number`, the length check against `n_len` is incorrectly implemented as it does not check the length of `num_str` after generating permutations. This means that `num_str` can be of any length, which contradicts the requirement that it must exactly match `n_len` derived from the input string.
- **Empty Remaining Characters**: If all characters from `s` are used by `sub`, there will be no candidates generated, leading to potential errors when trying to find the minimum.

### Edge Cases
- If `s` is such that `sub` consumes all digits in `s`, resulting in no remaining characters to form a valid `n`.
- Cases where the function erroneously allows invalid lengths for `num_str`, thus not fulfilling the problem's conditions.

### Conclusion
The program fails to ensure that the generated number `n` meets the criteria outlined in the problem description due to the faulty length validation logic and potential for empty permutations. Therefore, it does not work correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
