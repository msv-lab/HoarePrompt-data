The function accepts a non-empty string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It returns `True` if `sub` is a substring of `num_str`. However, the code does not validate the length of `num_str` against `n_len`, meaning this functionality is incomplete as it always returns `True` without checking the length condition. Thus, it does not enforce that the length of `num_str` equals `n_len` as stated in the annotations.
