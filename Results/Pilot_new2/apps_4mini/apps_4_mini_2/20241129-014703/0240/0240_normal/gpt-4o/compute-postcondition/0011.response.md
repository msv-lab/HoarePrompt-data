The code `yield candidate` results in yielding the current value of `candidate`, which is equal to `perm`. The variable `candidate` is not modified by the code, so its value remains the same. The other variables `chars` and `perm` are also unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `candidate`, which is equal to `perm`, has been yielded.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and `candidate` has been yielded.**
