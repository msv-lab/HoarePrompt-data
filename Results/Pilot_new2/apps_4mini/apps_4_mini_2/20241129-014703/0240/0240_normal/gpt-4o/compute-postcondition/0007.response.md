The `yield` statement is used to produce a value from a generator function but does not change the values of the variables in the program. In this case, `candidate` is yielded, indicating that a value will be returned when the generator is iterated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to the second permutation of `chars` as a string, and the value of `candidate` is yielded.**
