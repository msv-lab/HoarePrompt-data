According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` variable. The `permutations` function generates all possible permutations of the `chars` string. Thus, for the loop to execute, the `chars` string must be non-empty, as an empty string would result in no permutations. At the start of the loop, the `perm` variable will represent the current permutation being processed.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `chars` must contain at least one character, and `perm` will be the first permutation of `chars` when the loop starts.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
