Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to the second permutation of `chars` as a string. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then the value of `candidate` is yielded.***
