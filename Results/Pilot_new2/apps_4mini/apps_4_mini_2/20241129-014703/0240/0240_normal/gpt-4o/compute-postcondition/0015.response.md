Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `chars` representing a sequence of digits and a non-empty string `sub` representing a substring. It generates and yields all unique permutations of the digits in `chars` that are considered valid according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`. If no valid permutations exist, the function yields no values. The function does not return a list; instead, it is a generator that yields valid candidates one at a time. **
