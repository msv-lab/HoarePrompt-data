#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string of digits that may contain leading zeroes.
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits, `n_len` is equal to `len(s) - len(sub)`, `s_counter` reflects the frequencies of digits in `s` after subtracting the corresponding frequencies from `sub_counter`.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the minimum integer value from the list of possible numbers generated from the remaining characters in string `s` after accounting for the frequencies in `sub`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `sub`, both consisting of digits. It calculates the frequencies of digits in `s` and subtracts the frequencies of digits found in `sub`. Then, it generates possible numbers using the remaining characters in `s` after the subtraction. Finally, it returns the smallest integer value from the generated numbers. If there are no remaining characters after the subtraction, this could result in an error when trying to compute the minimum, which is a potential edge case not handled in the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a non-empty string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty substring of num_str which can contain leading zeroes.
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if 'sub' is a substring of 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len', where 'num_str' is a non-empty string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and 'sub' is a non-empty substring of 'num_str' which can contain leading zeroes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It returns `True` if `sub` is a substring of `num_str`. However, the code does not validate the length of `num_str` against `n_len`, meaning this functionality is incomplete as it always returns `True` without checking the length condition. Thus, it does not enforce that the length of `num_str` equals `n_len` as stated in the annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a string representing a sequence of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string representing a substring of n which can contain leading zeroes.
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits, `candidate` is a string formed by one of the permutations of `chars` that is a valid number according to `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, and `perm` represents all permutations of `chars`. If there are no valid candidates, the loop does not yield any values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `chars` representing a sequence of digits and a non-empty string `sub` representing a substring. It generates and yields all unique permutations of the digits in `chars` that are considered valid according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`. If no valid permutations exist, the function yields no values. The function does not return a list; instead, it is a generator that yields valid candidates one at a time.
