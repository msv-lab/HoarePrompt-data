The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates on two variables: `n`, which is a positive integer constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k`, which is a non-negative integer constrained by 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. 

Since the output details are not provided in the task, I will summarize based on the constraints alone. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly, but operates with the constraints of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). The specific return value or behavior based on these inputs is not defined.**
