To determine whether the `while` loop can execute, we need to analyze the condition `n % x != 0`. For the loop to run at least once, the condition must evaluate to `True`, meaning that `n` must not be divisible by `x`.

Given the provided states:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\).
- `x` is equal to \(10^k\).

The values of `x` can be:
- When \(k = 0\), \(x = 10^0 = 1\).
- When \(k = 1\), \(x = 10^1 = 10\).
- When \(k = 2\), \(x = 10^2 = 100\).
- When \(k = 3\), \(x = 10^3 = 1000\).
- When \(k = 4\), \(x = 10^4 = 10000\).
- When \(k = 5\), \(x = 10^5 = 100000\).
- When \(k = 6\), \(x = 10^6 = 1000000\).
- When \(k = 7\), \(x = 10^7 = 10000000\).
- When \(k = 8\), \(x = 10^8 = 100000000\).

For the loop to execute, it is necessary that `n % x != 0`. This means that `n` must not be a multiple of `x`. 

Since `n` is already given as a positive integer, we need to ensure that it is not divisible by `x`. The requirement can be adjusted as follows:

1. If `x` is 1, `n % 1` will always be 0, meaning the loop will never execute. Thus, `k` must be greater than 0.
2. For any other value of `x` from 10 to \(10^8\), if `n` is a multiple of `x`, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to modify `n` to ensure that it does not meet this condition.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we can summarize the adjusted states:

State: **`n` is a positive integer not divisible by \(10^k\) for \(k\) in the range [1, 8]**.
