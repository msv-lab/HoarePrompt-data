The value of `x` is assigned the value of \(10\) raised to the power of `k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of \(0\) to \(8\), the possible values of `x` will range from \(1\) (when \(k = 0\)) to \(100000000\) (when \(k = 8\)). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is equal to \(10^k\)**
