`n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer and not divisible by \(10^k\) for \(k\) in the range [1, 8], the new value of `n` remains a positive integer and continues to satisfy the condition of not being divisible by \(10^k\). The condition that `n + 1` must not be divisible by `x` is not changed, as it still holds since `n` was originally not divisible by `x`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not divisible by \(10^k\) for \(k\) in the range [1, 8]; `n` is incremented by 1, and `n + 1` must not be divisible by `x`.**
