The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 8. After executing the function body, it returns a value `x`, which is calculated as `n` multiplied by (multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and multiplier), where `multiplier` is defined as 10 raised to the power of `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return a computed value based on the multiplication of `n` and the adjusted multiplier derived from `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a non-negative integer k, and returns x, where x is calculated as n multiplied by (10^k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10^k).**
