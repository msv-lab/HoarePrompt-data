The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, and that `(t - s_i)` is not divisible by `d_i`, it can be concluded that `wait_time` will be a positive integer. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is less than `t`, `(t - s_i)` is not divisible by `d_i`, and `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
