Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is updated if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is set to 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[1]`, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.`***
