The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Since `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]` and the current value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the value of `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, the current value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, the current value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.**
