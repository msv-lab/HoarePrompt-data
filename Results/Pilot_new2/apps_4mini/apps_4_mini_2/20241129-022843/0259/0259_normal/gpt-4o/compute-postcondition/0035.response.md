The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, and `min_wait_time` remain unchanged. The specific values of `i` were not provided in the initial state, so `chosen_route` becomes `i + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, and `min_wait_time` equals `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, `min_wait_time` equals `wait_time`.**
