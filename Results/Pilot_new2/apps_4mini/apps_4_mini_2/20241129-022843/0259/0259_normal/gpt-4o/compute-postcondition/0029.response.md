Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` remains unchanged, `i` is now greater than or equal to 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.**
