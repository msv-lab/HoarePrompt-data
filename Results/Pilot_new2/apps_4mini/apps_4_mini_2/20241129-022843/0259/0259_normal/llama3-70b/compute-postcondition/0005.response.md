According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`, which dictates how many times the loop will run. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the loop has already executed once, it has been decremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. If this loop has executed once, `n` must be greater than 1 for it to execute one more time. Therefore, to execute again, `n` must be at least 2.

Additionally, the loop variable `_` is not used later, so it doesn't affect any other state. Hence, we can conclude that the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 99, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, where `s` is an integer from input, `d` is an integer from input.**
