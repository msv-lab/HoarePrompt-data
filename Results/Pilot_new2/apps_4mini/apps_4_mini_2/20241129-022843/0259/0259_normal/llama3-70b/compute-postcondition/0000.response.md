The variables `n` and `t` are assigned new values from the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer. The previous values of `n` and `t` are unknown, but they must adhere to the given constraints (i.e., `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= t <= 10^5`). Since the input will provide new values for both `n` and `t`, we cannot specify their exact new values without knowing the input. Therefore, we can only indicate that they are now integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, and both `n` and `t` are now assigned values from user input.**
