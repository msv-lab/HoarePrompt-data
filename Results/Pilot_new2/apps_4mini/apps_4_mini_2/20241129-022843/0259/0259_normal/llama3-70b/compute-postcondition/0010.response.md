The `buses` list is updated by appending a new tuple `(s, d)` to it, where `s` and `d` are defined as input integers. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and `buses` will now include the original tuple as well as the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is a list containing the original tuple `(s, d)` as well as the new tuple `(s, d)` appended.**
