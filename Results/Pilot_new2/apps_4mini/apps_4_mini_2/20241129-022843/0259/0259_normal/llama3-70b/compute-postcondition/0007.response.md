The code `buses.append((s, d))` adds a new tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. Since `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, after this operation, `buses` will contain two tuples: the original tuple and the newly added tuple. The previous values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 99, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is a list containing two tuples: the original tuple `(s, d)` and the new tuple `(s, d)`.**
