The code `buses.append((s, d))` appends a tuple containing the values of `s` and `d` to the `buses` list. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The initial conditions state that `buses` is an empty list, and now it will contain one tuple `(s, d)` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, where `s` is an integer from input, `d` is an integer from input.**
