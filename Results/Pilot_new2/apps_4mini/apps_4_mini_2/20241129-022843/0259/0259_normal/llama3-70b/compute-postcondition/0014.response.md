According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate over the list `buses`, which contains `n` tuples. For the loop to execute, the list `buses` must have at least 1 element, meaning `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, this condition is satisfied. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will represent the index of the current tuple being processed, and it will begin at 0. The tuple `(s, d)` will correspond to the first element in the `buses` list during the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following states must be adjusted:

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`**.
