The variables `s` and `d` are assigned the values from the input after being split and converted to integers. The input will define `s` and `d` as integers. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 99, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)` where `s` is the first integer input and `d` is the second integer input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 99, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)` where `s` is the first integer input and `d` is the second integer input.**
