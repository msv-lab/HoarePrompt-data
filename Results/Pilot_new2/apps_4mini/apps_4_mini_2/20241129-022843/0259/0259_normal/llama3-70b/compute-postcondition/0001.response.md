The variable `buses` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and their previous conditions are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` is an empty list.**
