Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, and `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is set to `time` and `ans` is set to 2.***
