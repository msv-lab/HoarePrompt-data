The variable `pos1` is assigned the value of the index of the integer `1` within the list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers within the range of `1` to `n`, the index of `1` in list `a` will be some integer value between `0` and `n-1`. The state of the other variables is not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers derived from input, containing `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the integer 1 in list `a`.**
