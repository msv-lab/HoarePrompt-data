To analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial state:

1. `min_dist` is assigned the value of `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
2. Since `pos1` and `posn` represent the indices of the integers `1` and `n` in the list `a`, their absolute difference `abs(pos1 - posn)` is calculated. 
3. This absolute difference is then reduced by 1, and the minimum is taken with `n - 2`.
4. The values of `n`, `pos1`, and `posn` remain unchanged, while `min_dist` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers containing `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the integer 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of the integer n in list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is equal to `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
