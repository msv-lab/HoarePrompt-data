The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input values provided as a string (the result of `input().split()`), which will generate a list of integers. The integers in `a` must be distinct and fall within the range from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, inclusive. The exact contents of `a` depend on the input provided, but it will always respect the constraints set by `n`.

Thus, the Output State would be: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`, based on the provided input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`.**
