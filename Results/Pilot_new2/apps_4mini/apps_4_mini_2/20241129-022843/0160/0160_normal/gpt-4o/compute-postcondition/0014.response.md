Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` (the first element of the tuple), including 1 and `x` itself. If `x` is 1, then `divisors` contains only {1}.**
