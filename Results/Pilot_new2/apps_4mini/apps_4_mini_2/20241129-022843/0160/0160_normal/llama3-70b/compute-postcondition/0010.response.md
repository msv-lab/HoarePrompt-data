The variable `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`. The values of `N`, `A`, `K`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9; `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`; `i` is `N-1`; `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9; `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`; `i` is `N-1`; `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`.**
