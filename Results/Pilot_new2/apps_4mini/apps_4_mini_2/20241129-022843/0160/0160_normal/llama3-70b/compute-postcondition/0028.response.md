Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` positive integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` less than or equal to `gcd`, `i` is greater than `0` and less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, the value of `max_divisor` remains unchanged if no divisors are found, or is updated based on the divisors of `gcd`.**
