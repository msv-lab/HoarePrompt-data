The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. Given that `gcd` is at least 1 and divisible by `1`, `gcd // i` is also a positive integer since `i` is `1`. Therefore, `max_divisor` is updated to `max(max_divisor, gcd)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` positive integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `i` is now 1, `max_divisor` is updated to `max(max_divisor, gcd)`, `gcd` must be at least 1, and the current value of `gcd` is divisible by `1`, and the current value of `gcd` is not equal to `i * i`.**
