Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Inefficiency in the Range**: The program uses a for loop to iterate through every integer from `l` to `r` and checks if each number has at most `k` different digits using `func_1`. Given the constraints where both `l` and `r` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), this approach is not feasible since iterating through potentially \(10^{18}\) numbers is computationally prohibitive.

2. **Missing Modulo Constant**: The variable `MOD` is referenced in `func_2`, but it is not defined within the provided code. This results in a potential runtime error when the program attempts to perform modulo arithmetic.

3. **Output Incorrectness**: The problem description specifies that the output should be the sum modulo \(998244353\). However, the code does not guarantee that the constant \(998244353\) is used, as `MOD` is not defined.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where `l` equals `r` correctly in terms of efficiency, as it still performs an unnecessary check even when there is only one number to consider.

Thus, while the logic within the functions seems to align with checking for at most `k` unique digits and summing those numbers, the overall execution and structure do not adhere to the problem constraints and would lead to incorrect behavior in practical scenarios.
