#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns whether the length of the set of unique digits in the integer 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', where 'n' is an integer between 'l' and 'r'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and returns `True` if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not take into account the bounds of `n` being between `l` and `r`, as stated in the annotations, since it operates solely on the value of `n` provided to it.

    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum, which is the sum of all integers num from l to r for which func_1(num, k) returns true, taken modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition defined by `func_1(num, k)`, taken modulo `MOD`. If no integers satisfy the condition, it returns 0.
