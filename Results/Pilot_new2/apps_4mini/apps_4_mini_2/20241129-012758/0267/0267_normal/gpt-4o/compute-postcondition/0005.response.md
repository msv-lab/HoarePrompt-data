According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `l` and `r`. The loop continues to execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`, and the loop will execute again for the next integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `num` by 1. Thus, `num` will be `l + 1`. Since `l` is less than or equal to `r`, we must also ensure that `l + 1` is still less than or equal to `r`, which it will be if `l` is less than `r`.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is equal to `l % MOD, `num` is equal to `l + 1`, and if `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then the condition is satisfied.**
