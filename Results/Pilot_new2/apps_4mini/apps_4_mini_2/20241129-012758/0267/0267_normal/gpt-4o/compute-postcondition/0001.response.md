According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, meaning there is at least one number in the range from `l` to `r`. Since `total_sum` starts at 0 and does not affect the execution of the loop, it does not need adjustment. The initial values of `num` for the first iteration will be equal to `l`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
