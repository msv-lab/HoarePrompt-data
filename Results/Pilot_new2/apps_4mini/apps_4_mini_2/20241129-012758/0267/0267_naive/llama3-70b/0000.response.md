To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Given two integers `l` and `r`, along with an integer `k`, we need to find the sum of all integers in the range `[l, r]` that have at most `k` distinct digits.
   - The result should be returned modulo `998244353`.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The function `count(n, k, dp)` calculates how many numbers from `0` to `n` have at most `k` different digits, caching results in `dp` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The return value of `func_1(l, r, k)` computes the sum of valid numbers by taking the difference of counts for `r` and `l-1`.

3. **Identifying Edge Cases**:
   - The code uses a mathematical approach to count numbers. However, it does not explicitly check each number in the range `[l, r]` to ensure it meets the criteria of having at most `k` different digits. 
   - For example, consider the input `l = 10`, `r = 20`, and `k = 1`. The valid numbers are `11`, which should be included in the sum, but they might not be counted correctly if the counting logic fails or misses certain combinations.

4. **Potential Failure Case**:
   - Let's take a specific case: `l = 100`, `r = 110`, `k = 2`. The numbers in this range are `100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110`. All of these numbers have 2 or fewer distinct digits, and thus should be included. However, we need to verify if the counting logic of the function handles this correctly.
   - Furthermore, if `k` is greater than the total number of distinct digits in the range, then all numbers should be counted. For instance, with `k = 10`, `l = 1`, and `r = 20`, every number from `1` to `20` should be included. If the logic fails to account for certain configurations, it may not yield the correct total.

5. **Conclusion**:
- Given the analysis, the program does not seem to cover all edge cases or ensure that all numbers in the range `[l, r]` with at most `k` distinct digits are counted accurately. Therefore, it can yield incorrect results for certain cases.

Correctness: **False**.
