To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic against the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and print this sum modulo `998244353`.

### Program Logic:
The program defines two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k)`: This checks if the number `n` contains at most `k` different digits. It converts the number to a string, creates a set from its characters (digits), and checks the length of that set against `k`.
2. `func_2(l, r, k)`: This sums all numbers from `l` to `r`, checking each with `func_1` to see if it meets the criteria of having at most `k` different digits.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Efficiency**: The program iterates through every number from `l` to `r`. This is a significant issue because the constraints allow `l` and `r` to be as large as \(10^{18}\). The program would take an impractical amount of time to run for large ranges.
   
2. **Incorrect Handling of Ranges**: If `l` is much smaller than `r`, the program could potentially take an enormous amount of time to complete, leading to an impractical implementation. The problem description does not mention that the function should handle large ranges efficiently, but given the constraints, an efficient approach is necessary.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not seem to account for potential edge cases, such as when `l` equals `r`, which should directly return the value of `l` if it meets the criteria.

4. **Modulo Calculation**: The modulo operation is correctly implemented, but because of the time inefficiency, it might not even reach the correct output for larger ranges before timing out.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle large inputs efficiently, and the brute force approach is fundamentally flawed given the size constraints of `l` and `r`. At the very least, we can conclude that the program is not correct due to performance issues, which means it cannot fulfill the requirements as stated.

Correctness: **False**.
