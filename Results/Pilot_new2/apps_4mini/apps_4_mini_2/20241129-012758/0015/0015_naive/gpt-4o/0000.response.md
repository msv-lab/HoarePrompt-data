To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description:

The program is trying to check if a given integer `b` is part of an arithmetic sequence defined by the first term `a` and the common difference `c`. 

Let's analyze the program thoroughly:

1. The first check `if b == a:` correctly identifies if `b` is the first element of the sequence.

2. The second check `elif c == 0:` returns 'NO' when the common difference `c` is zero. This is correct because if `c` is zero and `b` is not equal to `a`, then `b` can never appear in the sequence (the sequence would be constant at `a`). 

3. The third condition checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to see if `b` can be expressed in terms of the sequence, and `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that the index `i` (which is derived from this expression) is a positive integer.

However, there is a potential flaw in the logic. The issue arises in the handling of negative values for the common difference `c`:

- If `c` is negative and `b` is less than `a`, the program should return 'YES' only if `(b - a) % c == 0` because in this scenario, `b` can indeed be part of the sequence going in the reverse direction.
- The current implementation only checks for non-negative indices when `c` is positive, which fails to handle the case where `c < 0` properly.

**Example where the program fails:**
- For input `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and `c = -5`, the program will output `NO`, but `5` is actually part of the sequence: `10, 5, 0, -5, ...`. Thus, the program should output `YES`.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the program does not cover all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
