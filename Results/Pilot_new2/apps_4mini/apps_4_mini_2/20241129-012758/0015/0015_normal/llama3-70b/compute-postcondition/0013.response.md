Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0, then if `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, then if (b - a) is divisible by `c` and (b - a) / `c` is greater than or equal to 0, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
