In the given code snippet, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the user input, which is split and converted into integers. Since the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, they will be updated based on the user input. However, the specific input values are not provided, so we can only refer to them in a general manner.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers updated to the values obtained from user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9.**
