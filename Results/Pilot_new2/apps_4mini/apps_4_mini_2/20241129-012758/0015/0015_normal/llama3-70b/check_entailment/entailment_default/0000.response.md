To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, I will analyze the program step by step.

**Problem Description:** The program needs to determine if the integer `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference of `c`.

1. **Code Analysis:**
   - The first condition checks if `c == 0`. If `c` is zero, the sequence would consist of only the element `a`. Thus, it correctly checks if `a` equals `b`, returning "YES" if they are equal and "NO" otherwise.
   - The second condition checks if `c != 0`. It verifies two things:
     - Whether `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` (i.e., `(b - a) % c == 0`).
     - Whether the resulting quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative (i.e., `(b - a) / c >= 0`), ensuring that we are only considering positive indices of the sequence.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

2. **Edge Case Considerations:**
   - If `c > 0`, all elements in the sequence will increase from `a`, and we need to ensure that `b` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `c`.
   - If `c < 0`, the sequence will decrease from `a`. For `b` to appear in the sequence, it should be less than or equal to `a` and the difference should also be divisible by `c`.
   - The current implementation seems to handle these cases correctly.

3. **Output Hints Agreement:**
   - The hints state that if `c == 0`, we check if `a == b`. This matches the code logic.
   - When `c != 0`, the hints indicate checking if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which are also correctly implemented in the code.

4. **Testing Examples from the Problem Statement:**
   - For input `1 7 3`, we have `a = 1`, `b = 7`, and `c = 3`. The sequence is 1, 4, 7, thus output should be "YES" - which the code correctly produces.
   - For input `10 10 0`, since `a` is equal to `b`, the output should be "YES" - which is also correct.
   - For input `1 -4 5`, the sequence would only have positive integers starting from 1, hence output should be "NO" - which is correct.
   - For input `0 60 50`, the sequence starts from 0 and increases by 50, producing 0, 50, 100... and does not include 60, thus output should be "NO" - which is correct.

**Conclusion:**
The program handles all edge cases as expected according to the problem description and output hints. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic to determine if `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by `a` and `c`, accurately checking for both conditions when `c` is zero and when it is non-zero. All tested examples provide the expected outputs.
