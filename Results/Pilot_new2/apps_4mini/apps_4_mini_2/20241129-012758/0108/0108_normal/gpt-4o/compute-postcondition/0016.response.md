The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects the updated value of `i` while maintaining the conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length at least 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is now 3; `j` is now greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than 27.**
