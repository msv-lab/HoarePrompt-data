The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is less than 26, so after incrementing `j`, it will be at least 1 and less than or equal to 26. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length at least 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is now greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 26.**
