According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of `char` in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains characters from `k + 3` to 'z', meaning it does not include characters from 'a' to `k`, which includes the `char` variable if `char` is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `char` must be greater than `k`, and `s` must include `char`. 

To ensure `char` is in `s`, we need to adjust `s` such that it contains `char`. Thus, we need to change the state of `s`.

State: **`s` must contain `char` and `res` contains characters from 'a' to `k` plus `char`**
