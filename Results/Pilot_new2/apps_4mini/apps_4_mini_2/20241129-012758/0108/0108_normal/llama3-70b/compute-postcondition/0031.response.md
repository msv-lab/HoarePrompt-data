The value of `s` is updated by replacing the first occurrence of `char` ('a') with the character that is one position after 'a' in the ASCII table, which is 'b'. Therefore, `s` becomes 'bababcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The values of `res` and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is 'bababcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aaaabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char` is 'a'**
