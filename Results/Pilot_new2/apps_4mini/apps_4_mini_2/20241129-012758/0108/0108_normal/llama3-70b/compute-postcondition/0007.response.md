According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'b', `res` is 'a', and `char` is 'a'. Since `char` (which is 'a') is not in `s` (which is 'b'), the loop cannot execute again. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `char` needs to be modified to be equal to 'b', which is the only character present in `s`. 

State: **`s` is 'b', `res` is 'a', `char` must be 'b'**
