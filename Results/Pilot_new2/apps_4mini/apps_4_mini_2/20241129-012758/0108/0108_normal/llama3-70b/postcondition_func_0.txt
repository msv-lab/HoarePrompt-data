The function accepts a string `s` consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters and constructs a new string `res` by replacing each character in `s` with its subsequent character in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on). After processing all characters, if `res` contains exactly 26 characters (indicating that all letters from 'a' to 'z' were present in `s`), it prints `res`. If not all letters are present, it prints `-1`.
