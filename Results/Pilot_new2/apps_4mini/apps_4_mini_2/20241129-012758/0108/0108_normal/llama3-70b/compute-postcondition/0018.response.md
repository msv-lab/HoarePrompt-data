According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the contents of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains characters from `k + 2` to 'z', and `char` is equal to `k + 2`. This means that `char` is currently the smallest character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be in `s`, which it is, so no adjustment is necessary.

State: **`s` contains characters from `k + 2` to 'z', `res` contains characters from 'a' to `k` plus `char` which is `k + 2`, `char` is `k + 2`**
