The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the next character in the ASCII sequence. The value of `char` is 'c', and the ASCII value of 'c' is 99. The character that follows 'c' in the ASCII sequence is 'd' (ASCII value 100). 

The initial state shows that `s` is 'c', so after the replacement, `s` will become 'd'. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 'd', `res` is 'abc', `char` is 'c'.

Output State: **`s` is 'd', `res` is 'abc', `char` is 'c'**
