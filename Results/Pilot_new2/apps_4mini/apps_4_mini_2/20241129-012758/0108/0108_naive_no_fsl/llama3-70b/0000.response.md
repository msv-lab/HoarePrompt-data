Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where it is not possible to form the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" from the input string. 

For example, consider the input:
```
zzz
```
In this case, the program would replace 'z' with nothing (since 'z' cannot be replaced with any other letter), and it would end up with an empty `res` string. Since the length of `res` would not be 26 after processing, it would print `-1`, which is correct.

However, if we take another input:
```
abcz
```
The logic would attempt to create "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" by performing replacements. It would correctly identify that it can form 'a', 'b', 'c', but would then be stuck since 'z' cannot be replaced further. The output of the program would be `-1`, indicating impossibility, which is correct.

However, if we take a string like:
```
abcdefghij
```
The program would not be able to form the remaining characters 'k' to 'z' since it does not have any of those characters, leading to an incorrect handling of the logic for subsequent replacements and checks.

Thus, the provided logic misses edge cases where insufficient characters are present to form the full sequence. Hence, the program's correctness cannot be guaranteed for all possible cases.
