Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where at least one index is `True` or all indices are `True` if the loop executed completely without finding any valid cube for the digit; `found` is `False`, indicating that no index in `used_cubes` was set to `True` during the loop execution.***
