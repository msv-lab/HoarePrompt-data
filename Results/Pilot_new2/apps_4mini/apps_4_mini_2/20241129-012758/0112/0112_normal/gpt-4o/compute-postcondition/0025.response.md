The value of `found` is assigned `False`, which means that regardless of its previous value, `found` will now be `False`. The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters; `digit` is the second character in `digits`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, where at least one index is `True`; `found` is False.**
