The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters; `digit` is the second character in `digits`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where index 2 is now True; `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
