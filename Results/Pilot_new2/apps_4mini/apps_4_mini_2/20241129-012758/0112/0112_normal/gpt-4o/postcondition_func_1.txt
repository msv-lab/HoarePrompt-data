The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all digits of `num` can be formed using the faces of cubes represented by `cube_faces`. The function returns True if all digits can be matched to the faces of the cubes without reusing any cube for more than one digit; otherwise, it returns False. It will return False if any digit cannot be found in the available cube faces. There is no validation for the conditions of `n` or the cube faces, meaning if `n` is out of the expected range or if the cube faces contain invalid data, the behavior of the function could be unpredictable.
