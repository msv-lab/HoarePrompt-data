The statement `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the value at index `i` of the list `used_cubes` to `True`. Given that `i` is currently 1, this means that the second element of the `used_cubes` list is now `True`. 

Before this line of code was executed, `used_cubes` was a list of length `n`, where at least one index was `True`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the `used_cubes` list can either have a length of 2 or 3. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `digits`, and `digit`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where the second index is now True, and at least one index remains True.**
