The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. The parameter `num` is an integer. Based on the provided cases, if the digit has not been found in any of the cube faces corresponding to the indexes of used cubes, the function returns `False`. Additionally, if no valid cube was found during the execution, indicating that 'found' is False, the function also returns `False`. Furthermore, if no cube was found where 'digit' is present in 'cube_faces[i]' for any index i from 0 to n-1, the function returns `False`. However, if all digits have been successfully found in the corresponding cube faces, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num`, and based on the analysis of the cubes' faces, return `True` if all required digits are found, or `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `num`, and returns `True` if all required digits are found in the corresponding cube faces; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
