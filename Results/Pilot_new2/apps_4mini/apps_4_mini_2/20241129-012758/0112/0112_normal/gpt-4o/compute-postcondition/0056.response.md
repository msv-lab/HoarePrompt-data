The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `n` and `i` still hold: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `i` has been updated to `i + 1`, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `found` is True**.
