Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, and `found` is set to True if `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`. In this case, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is updated to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
