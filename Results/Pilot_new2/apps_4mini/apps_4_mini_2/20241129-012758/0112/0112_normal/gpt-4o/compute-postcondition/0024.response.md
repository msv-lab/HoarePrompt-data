According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as there are characters in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, and the state of the `digits` list is such that it has at least one character. Since `n` is an integer value between 1 and 3 inclusive, it doesn't directly affect the iteration of the loop over `digits`. 

However, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next character in the `digits` list. If the current `digit` is the first character, then for the loop to execute again, we need to advance to the next character in `digits`. Assuming `digit` is the first character, the next character will be the second character in the list.

Thus, to execute one more iteration of the loop:
1. The `digits` list must still contain more characters after the first one.
2. The `digit` will then be the second character.

Since `digits` must have at least two characters for this to be valid, we can summarize the state adjustment.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters; `digit` is the second character in `digits`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, where at least one index is `True`; `found` is `True`, indicating that `digit` has been found in at least one of the `cube_faces` that correspond to the indexes of `used_cubes`.**
