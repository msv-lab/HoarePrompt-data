According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. Since `n` is equal to the input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` will contain at least 1 and at most 3 lists. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must not be empty, and on the first iteration, `cube` will be the first list in `cubes`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes properly, we need to specify that `cubes` contains at least 1 list and indicate which list is the first one being iterated over. 

State: **`n` is equal to the input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists containing integers between 0 and 9, `digits` is an empty set, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
