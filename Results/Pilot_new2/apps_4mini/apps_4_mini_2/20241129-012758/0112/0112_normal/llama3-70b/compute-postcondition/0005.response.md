According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop iterates over each `cube` in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is equal to an integer between 1 and 3, meaning there are at least `n` lists in `cubes`. Since `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `cubes` must have at least 2 lists, and `cube` will be the second list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is equal to 2, `cubes` is a list of 2 lists containing integers between 0 and 9, `digits` is now a set containing string representations of the integers in the second cube, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`**
