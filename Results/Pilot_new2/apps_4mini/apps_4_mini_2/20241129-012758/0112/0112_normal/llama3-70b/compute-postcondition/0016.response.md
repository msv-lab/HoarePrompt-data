Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lines, each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9. It collects all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, and then constructs the largest possible integer from the remaining digits. The function outputs this largest integer. If all digits are 0, the output would be an empty string.**
