`digits` is updated with string representations of each `digit` in `cube`. The set `digits` will now contain the string representations of the integers from the first list in `cubes`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `cubes` remains the same, and `cube` is still equal to the first list in `cubes`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is equal to the input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists containing integers between 0 and 9, `digits` is now a set containing string representations of the integers in `cube`, and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is equal to the input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists containing integers between 0 and 9, `digits` is now a set containing string representations of the integers in `cube`, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`.**
