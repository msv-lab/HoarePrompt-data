The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a new input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the code only affects `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `c` as the new input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer**.
