The statement calculates the output of an expression that uses `min_lemon`. The variable `min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Therefore, `min_lemon` will hold the minimum value among these three inputs.

The code then prints the result of the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This expression simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which is `min_lemon * 7`.

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the value of `min_lemon` is used in the calculation.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the output printed is `min_lemon * 7`.**
