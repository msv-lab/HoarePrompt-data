The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value from three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, and `c` is an input integer. After executing the code, `min_lemon` will hold the smallest value among these three. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
