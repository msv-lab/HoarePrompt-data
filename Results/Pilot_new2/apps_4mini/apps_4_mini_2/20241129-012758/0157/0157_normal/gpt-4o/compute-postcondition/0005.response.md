The code prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input positive integers, and `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Thus, `total_fruits` is determined by these inputs.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input positive integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7, and `total_fruits` has been printed.**
