To verify the correctness of the annotated program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads three integers from input, which represent the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons Usable**: The program calculates `max_lemons` using the formula:
   ```python
   max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
   ```
   This correctly determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available apples and pears. According to the recipe:
   - For each lemon, 2 apples are needed (hence `b // 2`).
   - For each lemon, 4 pears are needed (hence `c // 4`).
   Therefore, the use of `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that you do not exceed the available quantities of any fruit.

3. **Calculating Total Fruits**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   ```python
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
   This simplifies to:
   ```python
   total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
   ```
   This calculation is consistent with the requirement that the total count of fruits used (lemons, apples, and pears) must be reported.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the `total_fruits`, which is the required output.

Now let's consider some potential edge cases:
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` are not enough to make at least one complete set of fruits following the ratio (for example, if `c = 1`), the program would calculate `max_lemons` as 0, resulting in `total_fruits` being 0, which is correct.
- In the case of large values (like 1000 for all fruits), the program still accurately calculates how many sets of fruits can be made.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly follows the problem description for all valid inputs. It accurately calculates the maximum total number of fruits that can be used for the compote according to the specified ratios.

Correctness: **True**
