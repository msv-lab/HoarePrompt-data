The value of `total_days` is equal to `2^n`. The code updates `denominator` by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. Therefore, `denominator` becomes `(denominator * (2^n)) % MOD`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to `2^n`; `denominator` is updated to `(denominator * (2^n)) % MOD; `i` is 2; `numerator` remains unchanged.**
