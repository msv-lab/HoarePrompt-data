To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. The initial state specifies that `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\).
2. The `denominator` is updated by multiplying its current value by `total_days` and taking the result modulo `MOD` (which is 1000003).
3. Given that `total_days` is \(2^n\), the new value for `denominator` will be calculated as:

   \[
   \text{denominator} = \text{denominator} \times (2^n) \mod 1000003
   \]

Since `denominator` was previously defined, its specific value will depend on prior calculations, but it will be updated as above.

The values of `n`, `k`, `MOD`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `i` remain unchanged because the operation only affects `denominator`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\); `numerator` is updated to \(numerator \times (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\); `denominator` is updated to (\(denominator \times (2^n) \mod 1000003\)); `i` is 1.**
