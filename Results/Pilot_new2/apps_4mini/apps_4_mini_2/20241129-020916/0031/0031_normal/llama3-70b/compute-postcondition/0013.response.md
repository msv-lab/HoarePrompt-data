The value of `gcd` is calculated using the `math.gcd` function, which finds the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. Based on the initial state, the values of `numerator` and `denominator` depend on the value of `k`. 

1. If `k = 2`, then `numerator = 2` and `denominator = 4`, so `gcd = math.gcd(2, 4) = 2`.
2. If `k = 3`, then `numerator = 0` and `denominator = 8`, so `gcd = math.gcd(0, 8) = 8`.
3. If `k > 3`, the value of `denominator` continues to grow, but since the value of `numerator` remains 0, `gcd` will still equal to `denominator`, which is greater than 8.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
- For `k = 2`: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is 2, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, and `gcd` is 2.
- For `k = 3`: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is 3, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 8, and `gcd` is 8.
- For `k > 3`: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is greater than 3, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is some integer greater than 8, and `gcd` is equal to that `denominator`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`; `k` is an integer such that `k ≥ 2`; `total_days` is 2; `numerator` is 2 if `k` is 2, `0` if `k > 2`; `denominator` is 4 if `k` is 2, `8` if `k` is 3, and continues to grow for `k > 3`; `gcd` is 2 if `k` is 2, `8` if `k` is 3, and equal to `denominator` if `k > 3.**
