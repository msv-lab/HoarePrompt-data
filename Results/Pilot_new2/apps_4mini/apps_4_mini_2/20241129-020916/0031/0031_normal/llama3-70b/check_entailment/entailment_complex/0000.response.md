To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly computes the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday among `2^n` days, given `k` people.

### Understanding the Problem
1. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that at least two people share a birthday can be derived from the complementary probability (i.e., the probability that no two people share a birthday). The formula for the probability that no two people out of `k` share a birthday among `2^n` days is given by:

   \[
   P(\text{no shared birthday}) = \frac{2^n \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2) \times \ldots \times (2^n - k + 1)}{(2^n)^k}
   \]

   Consequently, the probability that at least two people do share a birthday is:

   \[
   P(\text{at least one shared birthday}) = 1 - P(\text{no shared birthday})
   \]

   This results in the fraction:

   \[
   P(\text{at least one shared birthday}) = 1 - \frac{\text{numerator}}{\text{denominator}}
   \]

2. **Output Requirements**: The output must be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime, and both must be returned modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Analyzing the Annotated Program
1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes `total_days` as \( 2^n \). It also initializes `numerator` and `denominator`.

2. **Loop Over `k`**: The loop calculates the product for the numerator and denominator according to the formula for the probability of no shared birthdays.

3. **GCD Calculation**: After the loop, the program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction, which is required so that \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime.

4. **Return Value**: The return statement correctly returns the numerator and denominator modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Correctness Evaluation
- For cases where `k > total_days` (i.e., \( k > 2^n \)), the numerator will become zero because it is guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday. In this case, the program should return \( 1 \) (indicating certain probability) and \( 1 \) for the values of \( A \) and \( B \), which matches the expected output.
- For cases where \( 2 \leq k \leq 2^n \), the program calculates the numerator and denominator correctly based on the combinatorial logic outlined in the problem.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the problem description by accurately implementing the logic to calculate the probability, handling the edge cases where `k` exceeds `total_days`, and returning the output in the required format. Hence, the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
