To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1` and its implementation.

The problem requires calculating the probability that at least two out of `k` people have the same birthday when there are `2^n` possible days in a year. The result should be presented as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Total Days Calculation**: 
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 2 ** n`.

2. **Numerator and Denominator Construction**:
   - The numerator of the probability is calculated in a loop that constructs it as:
     \[
     \text{numerator} = (2^n - 0) \times (2^n - 1) \times ... \times (2^n - (k - 1))
     \]
   - The denominator is constructed as:
     \[
     \text{denominator} = (2^n)^k
     \]
   - This means that the function computes the probability of all `k` people having different birthdays.

3. **GCD Reduction**:
   - The program computes the GCD of the numerator and denominator, which is good for reducing the fraction.

4. **Modulus Operation**:
   - The results are taken modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \), which is required for the output.

### Possible Edge Cases:

1. **When \( k > 2^n \)**:
   - If the number of people \( k \) is greater than the number of days \( 2^n \), then it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday. In this case, the probability is \( 1 \), which should yield \( (A, B) = (1, 1) \).
   - The current code does not handle this case explicitly. Instead, it would still compute a probability based on the loop, which may not yield \( (1, 1) \).

2. **Testing Large Inputs**:
   - Given the constraints that \( n \) and \( k \) can go up to \( 10^{18} \), the calculations may also lead to overflow or invalid computations if not properly managed for such large integers, especially in languages where integer overflow can occur.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to cover the case when \( k > 2^n \), leading to an incorrect probability output. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

For example, for input `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the program should return `1 1`, but it will not handle this case correctly.
