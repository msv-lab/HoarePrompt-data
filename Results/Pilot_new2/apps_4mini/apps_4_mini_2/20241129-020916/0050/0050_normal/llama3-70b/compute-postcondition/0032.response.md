The variable `r` is assigned the value of `r + shares * b[i]`. Given that `shares` is initially 0, the term `shares * b[i]` will equal 0, no matter the value of `b[i]`. Therefore, `r` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000) that remains less than all elements of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 1, and `r` remains unchanged.**
