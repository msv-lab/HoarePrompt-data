Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers within the ranges (1 <= n <= 30 and n > 1), (1 <= m <= 30). If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, then `r` is updated to `r % s[1]` and `shares` is updated to at least equal to its previous value plus `r // s[1]`. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
