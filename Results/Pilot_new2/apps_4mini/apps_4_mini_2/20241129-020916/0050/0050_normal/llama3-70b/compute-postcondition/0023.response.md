Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer in the range (1 <= r <= 1000) that is less than all elements of `s` after all iterations, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is the total number of shares calculated from dividing `r` by each element of `s` that `r` was greater than or equal to, and `i` is equal to the total number of iterations executed (0 <= i <= n). If the loop didn't execute, `shares` remains 0.**
