The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by applying `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input and converts it into a list of integers. The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `s` now contains a list of `n` integers that are based on the input values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer based on input (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer based on input (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` integers based on input, where each s[i] (1 <= s[i] <= 1000) represents the price to buy shares, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each b[i] (1 <= b[i] <= 1000) represents the price to sell shares.**
