The operation `r %= s[i]` modifies the value of `r` by assigning it the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. The variable `s` is indexed at `i`, which is described as the next integer greater than its previous value. However, the initial values for `r` and `s[i]` are not provided, so we will work under the assumption that `r` is some integer value and `s` holds integers within the specified range.

The output state will only modify the `r` variable based on the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the ranges (1 <= n <= 30 and n > 1), `m` is an integer within the range (1 <= m <= 30), `i` is the next integer greater than its previous value, `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`, `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[i])`.**
