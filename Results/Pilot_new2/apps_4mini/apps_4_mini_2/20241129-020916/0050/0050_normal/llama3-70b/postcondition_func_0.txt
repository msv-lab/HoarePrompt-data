The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `r`, a list `s` of buying prices, and a list `b` of selling prices. It calculates the total number of shares that can be bought with `r` and attempts to sell them at the prices in `b`, printing the final amount of `r`, which may remain unchanged if no shares were bought.
