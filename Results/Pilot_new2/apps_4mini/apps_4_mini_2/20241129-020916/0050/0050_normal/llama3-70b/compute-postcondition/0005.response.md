The variable `shares` is initialized to `0`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer based on input (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer based on input (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer based on input (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on input (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is now a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer based on input (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer based on input (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on input (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is now a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0.**
