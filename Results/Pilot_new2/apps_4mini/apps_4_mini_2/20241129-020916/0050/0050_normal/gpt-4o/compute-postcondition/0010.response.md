The code calculates `total_bourles` based on the formula provided. The variables affected are `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, `remaining_bourles`, and `total_bourles`. The values for `max_shares` and `remaining_bourles` were derived from `r` and `min_buy_price`, which are unaltered. The specific values for `max_sell_price` and the computed value of `total_bourles` depend on the inputs.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000); `b` is a list of integers based on input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price; total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles**
