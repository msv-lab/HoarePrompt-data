The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and two lists `s` and `b` representing the prices to buy and sell shares, respectively. It calculates the minimum buy price from the list `s` and the maximum sell price from the list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the initial integer `r`. Otherwise, it computes the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buy price, calculates the remaining funds after purchasing these shares, and then computes the total funds after selling the shares at the maximum sell price. The resulting total is printed.
