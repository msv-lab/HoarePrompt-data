Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; remainder` is 0; `sequence` is equal to `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which reflects that all remaining remainder has been distributed into the sequence.**
