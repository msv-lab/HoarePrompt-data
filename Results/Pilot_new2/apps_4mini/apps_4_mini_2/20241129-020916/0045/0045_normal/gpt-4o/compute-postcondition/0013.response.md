According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, resulting in `i` being `k - 2`. 

The range of `i` is from `k - 1` to `0`, inclusive. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 2`, which must still be valid within the bounds of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; remainder` is `previous_value - 1`; `sequence` is equal to `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k - 2)] + [d * k + 1]; `i` is `k - 2`.**
