To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we can analyze the key aspects of the implementation and its alignment with the requirements specified.

The problem requires generating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and has the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD). The program functions in the following way:

1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The program first calculates the minimum possible sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is necessary because to have a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers, at least the first `k` positive integers must be used.

2. **Check Feasibility**: If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, the program correctly returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to create such a sequence.

3. **Determining the Sequence**:
    - The variable `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, which indicates how many times the minimum sum can fit into `n`. This is crucial for scaling the basic sequence.
    - The `sequence` is generated by multiplying `d` with each of the first `k` positive integers, resulting in a base sequence that is scaled appropriately.
    - The `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, which represents how much more needs to be added to the sequence to make the sum equal to `n`. The program then distributes this remainder across the sequence, ensuring the sequence remains strictly increasing.

4. **Returning the Sequence**: Finally, the adjusted sequence is returned, which should sum to `n` and maintain strictly increasing order.

### Evaluation of Correctness:

- **Strictly Increasing**: The sequence generated is strictly increasing since it starts with `d * 1`, `d * 2`, ..., `d * k`, and any increments made to accommodate the `remainder` will not violate the strictly increasing property.
- **Sum Equals `n`**: The final sequence is guaranteed to sum to `n` because it starts from the correctly scaled sequence and adjusts the last elements to account for any remaining sum needed.
- **Maximal GCD**: The GCD of the sequence is maximized because all elements are multiples of `d`. Given the calculation of `d` is based on the maximum possible scaling of the minimum valid sum, this ensures the GCD is as large as possible for the constructed sequence.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution as per the requirements specified in the problem description. It successfully checks feasibility, constructs a valid sequence, and ensures that the conditions of strictly increasing elements, correct sum, and maximized GCD are all satisfied.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
