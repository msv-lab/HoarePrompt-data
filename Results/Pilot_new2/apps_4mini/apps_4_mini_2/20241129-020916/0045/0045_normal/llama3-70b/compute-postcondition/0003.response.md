The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, where `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. Given that `a` is a positive integer representing the previous value of `b`, and `b` must be greater than 0, `a` will now be the previous value of `b`, and `b` will be the result of `a % b`. Since `a` is positive, `a % b` will yield a non-negative integer that can be zero or less than `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is `a % b` where `a` is a positive integer representing the previous value of `b` and `b` is greater than 0.**
