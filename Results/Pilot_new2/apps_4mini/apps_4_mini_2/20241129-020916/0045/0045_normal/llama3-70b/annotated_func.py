#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the sum n, b is a positive integer representing the number of elements k, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is `a`, while `b` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The GCD is computed using the Euclidean algorithm, which continues until `b` becomes 0. The function correctly handles all positive integer inputs within the specified range, ensuring that the result is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
