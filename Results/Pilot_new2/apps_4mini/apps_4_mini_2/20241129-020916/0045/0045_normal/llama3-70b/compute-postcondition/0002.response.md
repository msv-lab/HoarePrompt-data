According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is a non-negative integer equal to `a % b` and less than the previous value of `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be greater than 0. Since `b` is less than the previous value of `b`, it indicates that `b` must have been at least 1 at some point, and now it needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is a positive integer representing the previous value of `b`, `b` must be greater than 0**
