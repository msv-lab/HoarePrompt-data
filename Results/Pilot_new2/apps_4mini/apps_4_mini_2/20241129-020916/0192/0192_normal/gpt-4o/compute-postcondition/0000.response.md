The variables `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the input they receive. The previous conditions state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but after executing the code, the exact values of `x` and `y` will depend on the input provided. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
