Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where both input integers are "0" (or contain only leading zeros). If both inputs are "0", after stripping leading zeros, both `a` and `b` would become empty strings. In Python, comparing two empty strings results in them being considered equal, which is incorrect for the problem statement as both inputs should be treated as equal when they represent the number "0".

For example, the input:
```
0
0
```
would yield:
```
=
```
But according to the problem description, "0" is equal to "0".

Thus, the program does not correctly account for all edge cases and is therefore incorrect.
