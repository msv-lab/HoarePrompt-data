Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it meets all specified criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input in one go using `input().split()`, which effectively captures the two very long integers, `a` and `b`, allowing for leading zeroes and accommodating very large input sizes (up to 10^6 digits).

2. **Leading Zero Removal**: Both `a` and `b` are processed with the `lstrip('0')` method to remove any leading zeroes. This ensures that the comparisons are made between the actual numerical values rather than the string representations with leading zeroes.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program includes checks for empty strings after removing leading zeroes. If `a` or `b` becomes an empty string (which would occur if they were both '0' or consisted entirely of leading zeroes), it assigns '0' to them. This correctly treats empty cases as zero according to the problem description.

4. **Length Comparison**: The program first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. This is an efficient first step since a longer string representation of a number indicates a larger numerical value. If one is longer than the other, it correctly prints '>' or '<' accordingly.

5. **Lexicographical Comparison**: If the lengths are equal, it then compares the strings lexicographically. In Python, string comparison works correctly for digits, so this will yield the correct results. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'; if they are equal, it prints '='.

6. **Output Format**: The output directly corresponds to the comparison results as specified in the problem description: print '<', '>', or '=' depending on the comparison.

In conclusion, the program effectively implements all the required features of the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, it is deemed correct.
