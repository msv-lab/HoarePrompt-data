Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem description specifically mentions that the function should use `raw_input()` in Python 2 instead of `input()`. The program uses `input()`, which does not align with the requirements stated.

2. **Leading Zero Handling**: The program removes leading zeros from the integers `a` and `b` using `lstrip('0')`. However, it does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are composed entirely of zeros correctly. For example, if both inputs are "0000", the program will strip the leading zeros and compare them as empty strings after stripping. This could lead to incorrect comparisons or outputs since it does not correctly account for the fact that two zeros should be equal.

3. **Output Conditions**: The program structure is complex but does ultimately produce the correct outputs in most cases. However, if the inputs are both zero (like "0000"), it will incorrectly identify them as unequal after stripping. It would not compare `0 < 0`, leading to potentially missing the correct "equal" output.

4. **Efficiency**: While the program does attempt to handle long integers by comparing lengths first, it does not optimize reading input as required by the problem description. The recommendation was to use fast input/output methods, which the current program does not fulfill.

Due to these critical issues, particularly the improper handling of leading zeros and input method, the program fails to satisfy the problem description's requirements in all potential scenarios.
