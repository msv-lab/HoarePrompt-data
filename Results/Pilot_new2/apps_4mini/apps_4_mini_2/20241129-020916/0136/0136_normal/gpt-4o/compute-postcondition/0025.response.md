Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, then if `a` is less than `b`, the output is confirmed as '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is confirmed as '>'; otherwise, the output is '='.***
