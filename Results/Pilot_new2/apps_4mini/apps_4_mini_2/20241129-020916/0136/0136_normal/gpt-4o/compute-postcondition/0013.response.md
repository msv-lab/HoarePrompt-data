The code `print('>')` outputs the string `'>'` to the console. It does not modify the values of the variables in the initial state, and the printed output does not affect the existing values of `a`, `b`, or `data`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the fact that the print statement has been executed.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'. The length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`. Printed output is '>'**
