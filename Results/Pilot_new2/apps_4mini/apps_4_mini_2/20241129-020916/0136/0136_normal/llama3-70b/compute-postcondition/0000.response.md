The variable `a` is assigned the value of `input()` after removing any leading zeroes using the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `a` is a string representation of a non-negative integer, if `input()` returns a string that consists only of zeroes, `a` will become an empty string. If it returns a non-negative integer as a string with leading zeroes, those zeroes will be removed. The variable `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeroes.**
