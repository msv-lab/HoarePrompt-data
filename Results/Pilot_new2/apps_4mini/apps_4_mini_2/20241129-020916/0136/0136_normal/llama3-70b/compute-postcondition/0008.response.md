The code simply prints the string `'>'`. It does not affect any of the variables `a` or `b`. Their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
