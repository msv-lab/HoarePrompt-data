The code `print('<')` will output the string '<' to the console. The values of variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and there are no outputs returned to any variable. The states of `a` and `b`, which are still non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeroes and `a < b`, hold true.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is less than `b`, and the output '<' is printed to the console.**
