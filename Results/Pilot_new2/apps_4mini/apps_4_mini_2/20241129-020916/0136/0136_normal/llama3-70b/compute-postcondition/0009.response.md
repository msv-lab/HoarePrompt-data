Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeroes, and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, then the output `<` is printed to the console. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, no output is generated for the comparison.***
