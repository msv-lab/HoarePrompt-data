The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which can contain leading zeroes and can have a maximum length of 10^6 digits. Based on the function's output, it performs an operation on these strings. However, the specific output generated from these inputs has not been provided. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently unclear. To provide a complete description, more information on the output for different input scenarios would be needed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers represented as strings.**
