To determine the output state after all iterations of the provided loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the input string `votes` and the initial state of the variables.

The loop processes the string `votes` character by character, and for each character:
- If the character is 'D', it appends the index of that character to the `d_queue`.
- If the character is not 'D', it appends the index of that character to the `r_queue`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\), `votes` is the input string (which must be non-empty), the following relationships emerge based on the loop's execution:

1. If the loop executes, it will run for `n` iterations since it iterates through each character in `votes`.
2. After all iterations:
   - `d_queue` will contain the indices of all occurrences of 'D' in `votes`.
   - `r_queue` will contain the indices of all occurrences of characters that are not 'D' in `votes`.

Now, let's summarize the final output state based on the cumulative results from processing all characters in `votes`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of all characters in `votes` that are not 'D'.**
