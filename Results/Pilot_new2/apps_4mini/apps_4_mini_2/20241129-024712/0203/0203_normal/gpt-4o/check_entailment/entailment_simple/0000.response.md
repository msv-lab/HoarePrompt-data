The provided program implements a voting system for two fractions (depublicans and remocrats), as described in the problem statement. It uses two queues to track which employees from each fraction are still eligible to vote.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of employees `n` and the string `votes` which contains the voting fractions of each employee.
   - It initializes two lists (`d_queue` and `r_queue`) to store the indices of employees from each fraction.

2. **First Loop**:
   - The program populates `d_queue` with indices of 'D' (depublicans) and `r_queue` with indices of 'R' (remocrats).
   - After this loop, the state of the queues correctly reflects the order of votes.

3. **Voting Simulation**:
   - The while loop continues as long as both queues have employees.
   - It processes employees by comparing the indices: 
     - The employee who has the smaller index (who will vote first) denies the other employee from voting.
     - The denied employee's index is adjusted by adding `n` to simulate the repeated rounds of voting.
   - This correctly simulates the repeated voting rounds until one of the queues is empty.

4. **Final Determination**:
   - After exiting the loop, if `d_queue` is not empty, it means depublicans have a surviving voter and will win, so 'D' is printed.
   - If `d_queue` is empty, remocrats win, and 'R' is printed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. It simulates the voting process and determines the winner based on the rules provided.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True** 

The program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description, accurately simulating the voting process and producing the correct output for all valid inputs.
