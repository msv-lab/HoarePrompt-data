The variable `d_queue` is assigned an empty list. The values of `n` and `votes` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `votes`, along with the new value of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is the input string stripped of whitespace; `d_queue` is an empty list.**
