The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. The state of `d_queue` will change as its first element is removed, but the other variables retain their values. Since `d_queue` must contain at least one index initially, it will now have one less element after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains at least one index (now with one less index), `r_queue` must contain at least one index; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue` before the pop operation.**
