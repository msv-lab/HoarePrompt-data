The value `i` is assigned the length of the `votes` string, and now `d_queue` will have `i` appended to it. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The state of `d_queue` will now contain the length of the `votes` string as an additional element.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is equal to the length of `votes`; `d_queue` now includes the length of `votes` as an appended value.**
