Output State: **`d_queue` and `r_queue` may be empty depending on the comparisons of indices; the final state of `d_queue` will include elements of the form `d_index + kn` for some integer `k` if those indices were initially less than the corresponding elements in `r_queue`; the final state of `r_queue` will include elements of the form `r_index + kn` for some integer `k` if those indices were initially greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `d_queue`. If both queues are empty, all indices have been processed through the loop.**
