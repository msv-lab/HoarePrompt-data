To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code and identify any potential issues or edge cases that are not being handled.

### Breakdown of the Code Logic

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The first line reads `n`, `m`, `k`: the number of blocks, floors per block, and apartments per floor.
   - The second line reads `a` and `b`: the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks:**
   - `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, determining the floor of Edward's apartment.
   - `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, determining the block of Edward's apartment.
   - The same calculations are performed for `b` to obtain `b_floor` and `b_block`.

3. **Time Calculation:**
   - The time to move between blocks is computed using the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`, which accounts for the circular nature of the building.
   - The time to move between floors is calculated based on whether Edward is above or below Natasha, adding an additional 10 seconds for the elevator wait time.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The total time is printed as the sum of block travel time and floor travel time.

### Potential Issues and Edge Cases

Upon reviewing the code, I noticed that the calculation of `a_block` and `b_block` is incorrect for determining which block Edward and Natasha are in. The formula used, `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, will not give the correct block number. 

For example, let's say `n = 4`, `m = 10`, `k = 5`. The total number of apartments is `n * m * k = 200`. The blocks should be numbered from 1 to `n` (1 to 4), but the calculation will incorrectly yield a number greater than 4 when `a` or `b` is sufficiently large. This will lead to incorrect indexing and erroneous time calculations.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the input:
```
4 10 5
201 6
```
- `a` is 201, which should place Edward in a non-existent block (5).
- The program would incorrectly calculate `a_block` as 5 and `b_block` as 1, leading to incorrect time calculations.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not handle the block calculation correctly, it will fail for cases where `a` or `b` exceed the total number of apartments effectively.

Correctness: **False**
