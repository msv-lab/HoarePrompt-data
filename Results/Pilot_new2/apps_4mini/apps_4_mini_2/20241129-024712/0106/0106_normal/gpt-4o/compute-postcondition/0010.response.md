The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The other variables remain unchanged in value. The output state will reflect the new value of `time_to_target_floor` while keeping the other variables as they are.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on `get_location(b)`; `time_to_exit` is defined based on `floor_a`; `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; reverse_walk_time` is equal to `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is equal to `min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time); time_to_target_floor` is equal to `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
