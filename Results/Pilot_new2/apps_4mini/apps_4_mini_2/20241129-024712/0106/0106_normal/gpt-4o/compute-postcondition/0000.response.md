Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`. The variable `apartment` has not been defined yet in the initial state.

```
block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

Now, the code calculates the value of `block` based on the given formula. The impact of the code on the program is to assign a value to `block` depending on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `block` will be calculated as the integer division of `(apartment - 1)` by `(m * k)`, incremented by 1.

Since `apartment` was not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific value for `block`. Therefore, we will represent `block` in terms of the undefined `apartment`, as it affects the output state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
