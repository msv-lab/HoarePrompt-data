The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 1000. The values of `a` and `b` fall between 1 and `n*m*k` and are distinct. The variable `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, which remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n*m*k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)`**.
