To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately reflects all aspects of the problem's requirements.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes in `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as inputs, which are consistent with the problem description (the number of entrances, floors, and apartments, as well as the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha).

2. **Getting Locations**: The program utilizes `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)` to determine the block (entrance) and floor for both apartments. The calculations in `get_location` align with how the apartments are structured in the building:
   - It correctly identifies the entrance (block) by dividing the apartment number by the number of apartments per block (`m * k`).
   - It determines the floor within the block by computing the remainder when dividing by `k`, which represents the apartments per floor.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - **Time to Exit**: The time to exit the current block (entrance) is computed. If Edward is on the first floor, it takes no time to exit. If he is on a higher floor, it correctly accounts for the time taken by the elevator (10 seconds to arrive + 1 second per floor).
   - **Walking Time**: The program calculates both the direct and reverse walking times between blocks, ensuring that the circular nature of the building is taken into account via modulo operations.
   - **Time to Target Floor**: The time taken to reach the target floor from the first floor of the target block is calculated correctly as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, which aligns with the problem description.

4. **Total Time Calculation**: The total time is computed by summing up the time to exit, the minimum walking time, and the time to reach the target floor.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It accurately calculates the necessary times and takes into consideration all the rules provided, including the circular nature of the building and the different time costs associated with using the stairs versus the elevator.

### Final Verdict:

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct as it adheres to the problem description and calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the rules given.
