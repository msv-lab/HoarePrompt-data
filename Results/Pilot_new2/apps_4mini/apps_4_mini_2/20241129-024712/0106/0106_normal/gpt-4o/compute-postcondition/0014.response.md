The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (where 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000), and two distinct integers `a` and `b` (where 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`). It computes a total time value based on the locations of `a` and `b` as determined by the `get_location` function. The calculation considers the time required to exit the floor, the time to walk between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor from `b`. 

The total time is derived as follows:
1. If the floor of `a` is 1, the exit time is set to 0; otherwise, it is computed based on the floor level of `a`.
2. The walking time between blocks is calculated both directly and in reverse, with the minimum value of the two being used.
3. The time to reach the target floor `b` is calculated based on its floor level.
4. The total time is the sum of the exit time, the minimum walking time, and the time to the target floor.

The function does not handle any edge cases related to the values of `a` and `b` beyond ensuring they are distinct and within the specified range. It also assumes that `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)` correctly return the block and floor for `a` and `b`, respectively.

Functionality: ** The function accepts positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and distinct integers `a` and `b`, and returns the total time calculated based on the time to exit from `a`, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the floor of `b`. **
