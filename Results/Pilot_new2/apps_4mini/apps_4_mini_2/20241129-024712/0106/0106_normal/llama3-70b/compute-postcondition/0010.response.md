To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, `k` are user input integers.
- `a`, `b` are user input values.
- `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
- `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
- `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `min_block_time` is equal to `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.
- The value of `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`.

Now executing the code:
```
min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
```

The variable `min_floor_time` is assigned a value based on the difference between `b_floor` and `a_floor`, multiplied by 5, and then increased by 10.

Since `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, the expression `(b_floor - a_floor)` is non-negative. Therefore, `min_floor_time` will be a value based on this calculation.

Output State:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` remain unchanged.
- `min_floor_time` is now equal to `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are user input integers; `a`, `b` are user input values; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1; a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is equal to `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is equal to `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.**
