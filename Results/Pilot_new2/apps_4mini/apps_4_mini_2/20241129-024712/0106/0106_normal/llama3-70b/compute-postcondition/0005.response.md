In the given code, `b_block` is calculated based on the value of `b`, `m`, and `k`. The previous values of the variables are:

- `n`, `m`, `k` are integers based on user input.
- `a` is equal to user input value 1.
- `b` is equal to user input value 2.
- `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
- `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`.

The impact of the code is that it calculates `b_block` using the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, which means `b_block` will now hold the value of this calculation, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers based on user input; `a` is equal to user input value 1; `b` is equal to user input value 2; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1.**
