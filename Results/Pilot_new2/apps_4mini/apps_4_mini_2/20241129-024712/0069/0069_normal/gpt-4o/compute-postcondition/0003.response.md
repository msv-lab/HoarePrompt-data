The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of all other variables remain unchanged, as the code only affects `index`. The output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `x` is an integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 1.**
