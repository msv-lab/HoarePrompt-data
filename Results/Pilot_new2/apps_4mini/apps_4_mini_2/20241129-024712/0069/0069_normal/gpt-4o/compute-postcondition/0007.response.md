The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data` is a list of strings and `index` is equal to 1. This means that `x` will take the integer value of the string located at `data[2]`. The variable `T` remains between 1 and 100, `n` retains its value as the integer conversion of `data[1]`, `data` is still a list of strings from the input, `index` remains 1, and `results` is still an empty list. However, the value of `x` is now the integer representation of the string at `data[2]`. 

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
