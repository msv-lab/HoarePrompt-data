Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing the output of the computation for each iteration of the loop based on the values of `n`, `x`, and the string `s`, `index` is equal to `3 * T + 1`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` during the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing cumulative balances for the last processed string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `-1` for that iteration; otherwise, it includes `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the total number of valid values in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions based on `x` and `balance`.**
