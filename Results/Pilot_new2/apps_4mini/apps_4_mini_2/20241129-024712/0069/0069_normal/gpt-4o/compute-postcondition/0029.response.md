The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its state from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1. The conditions regarding `x`, `b`, and `balance` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1. The current value of `x` minus `b` is divisible by `balance`, and the result of `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative.**
