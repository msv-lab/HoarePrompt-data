The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. The variable `index` is at least 3, which means `index + 1` is at least 4. The value of `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, and since `n` is a number that relates to the length of `prefix_balances`, we can infer that `data[index + 1]` will provide a valid integer value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value assigned to `x`.

Output State: **`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `index` is at least 3, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`.**
