The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character in the string `s` at position `i - 1`. If that character is '0', it adds 1, otherwise it subtracts 1. The relevant variables affected are `prefix_balances`, and the calculation depends on the specific value of `s[i - 1]`.

Since `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be at least 1, `index` must be at least 3, and `s` is a valid string, we know that `prefix_balances[i - 1]` exists and is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be at least 1, `index` must be at least 3, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
