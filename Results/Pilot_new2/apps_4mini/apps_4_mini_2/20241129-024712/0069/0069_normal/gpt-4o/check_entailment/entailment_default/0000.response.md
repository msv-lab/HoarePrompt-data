To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it in relation to the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description Analysis

The task is to find the number of prefixes of an infinite string `t` formed by repeating a binary string `s` such that these prefixes have a specified balance `x`. The balance is defined as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string.

1. **Balance Calculation**: The balance of string `s` is calculated as `cnt_0 - cnt_1`, which is correctly computed in the program.
  
2. **Prefix Balances**: The program computes the prefix balances of `s` up to its length `n`. This is done correctly using a loop that updates `prefix_balances`.

3. **Zero Balance Case**: If the overall balance of `s` is zero, it checks if `x` exists in `prefix_balances`. If it does, it indicates there are an infinite number of valid prefixes, returning -1. This logic is correctly implemented.

4. **Non-zero Balance Case**: For cases where the balance is non-zero, the program counts valid prefixes based on the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and checks if `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. This logic appears to be sound as it checks for valid multiples of the balance.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- **All Zeroes or All Ones**: If `s` consists entirely of '0's or entirely of '1's, this could lead to edge cases where the balance is extreme (either positive or negative).
- **Large Values for `x`**: The balance can significantly impact how many prefixes can be formed. Testing with large positive and negative values for `x` is crucial.
- **Empty Prefix**: The empty prefix should always count as a valid prefix, which is inherently handled in the program since it initializes `prefix_balances[0]` to `0`.

### Output Hints Analysis
1. The output hints indicate that the function checks for each test case and provides results based on the balance calculations and conditions derived from the balance. This aligns with the program's behavior.
2. The hints describe scenarios where the balance is zero and exist in the prefix balances, which leads to the result being -1, indicating infinite prefixes.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the code against the problem description and considering edge cases, the implementation seems correct. It handles both zero and non-zero balance cases appropriately and checks conditions for valid prefixes accurately.

Therefore, I can conclude:

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of prefixes with the given balance `x` for each test case, adhering to the specifications provided in the problem description.
