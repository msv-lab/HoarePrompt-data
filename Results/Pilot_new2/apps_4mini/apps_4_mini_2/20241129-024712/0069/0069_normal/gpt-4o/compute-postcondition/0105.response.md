The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it will now be one unit greater than it was before. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is greater than 0, `index` is valid (previous value + 3), `s` is `data[index + 2]` and valid, `x` is `data[index + 1]` and valid, `balance` is calculated from `s` and is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` contains at least 3 elements, `b` is the next element in the `prefix_balances` list, and `count` is increased by 1.**
