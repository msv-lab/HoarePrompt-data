The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is derived from the `data` list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this operation. The value of `T` continues to be between 1 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100; `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`; `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[index + 1])`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100; `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`; `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[index + 1])**.
