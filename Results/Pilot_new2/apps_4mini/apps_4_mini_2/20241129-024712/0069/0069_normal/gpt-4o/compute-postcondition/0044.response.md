The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100; `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`; `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[index + 1])`; `s` is equal to `data[index + 2] and `index` is increased by 3.
