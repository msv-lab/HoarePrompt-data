T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; for each test case, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the length of the binary string s, and x is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9; s is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
