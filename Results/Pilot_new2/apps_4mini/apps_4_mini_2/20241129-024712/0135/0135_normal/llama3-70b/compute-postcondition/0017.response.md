The code snippet executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'No', but it does not change the values of any variables. The initial state remains unchanged, as the variables are not modified in any way. Therefore, the output state will retain all the information from the initial state without any updates to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing 0 and possibly 1, `remainder` is equal to `n % 3**
