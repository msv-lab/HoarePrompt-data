The code initializes the variable `seen` as an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged and are still integers equal to the first and second input values, respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, and `seen` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `seen` is an empty set.**
