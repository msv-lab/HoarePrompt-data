The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`, where `n` is an integer and `i` is 1. Since any integer modulo 1 is 0, `remainder` will be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is 0**.
