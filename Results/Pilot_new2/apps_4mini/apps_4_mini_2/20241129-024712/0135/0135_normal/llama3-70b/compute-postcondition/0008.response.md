The `seen` set is updated to include the current value of `remainder`. Since `remainder` is already defined as 0 in the initial state, it will be added to the `seen` set. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen` is a set containing 0, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen` is a set containing 0, `remainder` is 0**
