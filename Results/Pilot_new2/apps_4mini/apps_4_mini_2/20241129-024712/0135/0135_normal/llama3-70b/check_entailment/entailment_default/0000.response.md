To assess the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem description and analyze the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to check if all remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. This means that for every pair `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`, it should hold that `n % i` is not equal to `n % j`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
seen = set()
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    remainder = n % i
    if remainder in seen:
        print('No')
        exit()
    seen.add(remainder)
print('Yes')
```
1. It reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes an empty set `seen` to track the remainders.
3. It iterates through all integers from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i`.
4. If the remainder is already in `seen`, it prints "No" and exits.
5. If no duplicates are found in the loop, it prints "Yes".

### Edge Case Consideration:
- It is important to note that `n % 1` will always be `0`, regardless of the value of `n`. This means that if `k >= 1`, the program will always output "No" since the remainder `0` will be repeated (for `1` and potentially other values).
- Also, for any `k` greater than `n`, the values of `n % i` for `i` in the range `(n + 1)` to `k` will always just yield `n` as the remainder (since the divisor is larger than the dividend).
- Hence, `k` values greater than `n` do not contribute any additional distinct remainders.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints state:
- The function checks if the remainders are unique when `n` is divided by every integer from `1` to `k`.
- It accurately describes that it will print "No" if any remainder is repeated.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the code does not handle the edge case where `k` is greater than `n` leading to multiple occurrences of the same remainder (`0` if `k >= 1`). Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic as outlined in the problem description since it will return "No" in cases where it should return "Yes", particularly if `k` is large enough. 

Thus, this portion:
- If `k = 1` → prints "No" (correct).
- If `k > 1` and `n >= 1` → prints "No" (correct, `n % 1` is always `0`).
- If `k` is very large and covers values greater than `n`, it will also print "No" incorrectly due to the logic missing handling for these pairs.

Hence, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
