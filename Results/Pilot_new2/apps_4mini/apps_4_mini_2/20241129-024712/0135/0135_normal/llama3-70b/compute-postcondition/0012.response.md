The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, and no variables are changed or updated. The program will stop executing, and the previous state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `seen` is a set containing 0, `remainder` is equal to `n % 2`, and 'No' has been printed.**
