In the given code snippet, the `print('No')` statement outputs the string 'No' to the console. The initial state indicates that the current value of `remainder` is already in the set `seen`. However, there are no changes to the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `seen`, or `remainder` from this line of code. 

The output statement does not affect the state of any variables, as it only produces an output. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is 0, and 'No' has been printed to the console.**
