The annotated program checks whether all remainders of the division of a number \( n \) by all integers \( i \) from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It first checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \) and returns "No". This is correct because if \( k \geq n \), the remainder \( n \mod k \) will be equal to \( n \) for \( i = n \) and could potentially overlap with remainders from smaller values of \( i \).

2. **Remainder Calculation**: The function initializes an empty set called `seen_remainders`. It then iterates through all integers \( i \) from 1 to \( k \), calculating the remainder of \( n \) divided by \( i \) for each \( i \). 

3. **Distinct Check**: For each calculated remainder, the function checks if it has already been seen (i.e., if it is already in the `seen_remainders` set). If it is found, the function returns "No", indicating that not all remainders are distinct.

4. **Adding Unique Remainders**: If a remainder is not found in the set, it is added to the set. This ensures that at the end of the loop, only distinct remainders are kept in the set.

5. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns "Yes".

### Analysis of Correctness

- **Distinct Remainders**: The logic of using a set to track seen remainders is appropriate because sets inherently do not allow duplicate values. Thus, the function effectively tracks distinct remainders.
  
- **Range Consideration**: The function correctly handles the case when \( k \) is less than \( n \) by iterating from 1 to \( k \) and thus does not include \( n \) in the calculations, which is necessary to avoid checking \( n \mod n \), which would equal 0 and could lead to duplicates.

- **Edge Cases**: The program behaves correctly for edge cases, such as when \( k = 1 \) (the only remainder would be \( n \mod 1 = 0 \)), and when \( n = k \) (it properly returns "No" for cases like \( n = 4, k = 4 \)).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all remainders from \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct based on the problem description. Therefore, it meets all specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
