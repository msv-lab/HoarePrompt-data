The provided program is designed to determine if the remainders of `n` divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct, following the requirements of the problem description. 

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Check**: The program first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If this is true, it immediately returns 'No'. This is correct because when `k >= n`, the remainders `n % k` could potentially repeat (for instance, both `n % n` and `n % (n-1)` will yield the same value if `n` is included).

2. **Remainder Calculation**: If `k < n`, the program proceeds to calculate the remainders `n % i` for each integer `i` from `1` to `k`. It keeps track of these remainders in a set called `seen_remainders`.

3. **Uniqueness Checking**: For each remainder calculated, the program checks if it has already been seen (i.e., exists in the `seen_remainders` set). If it has, the program returns 'No', indicating that not all remainders are distinct.

4. **Returning 'Yes'**: If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the program returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are indeed distinct.

Now, let's consider the correctness of the program against the problem description:

- The program correctly handles the case where `k >= n`, as it recognizes that remainders can repeat in this scenario.
- The logic for checking distinct remainders in the range from `1` to `k` is sound, utilizing a set to track previously computed remainders, which ensures that duplicates are detected efficiently.

The only potential concern could be related to the size of the values for `n` and `k` (up to `10^18`), but Python's integer type can handle these sizes without overflow, and the approach taken (iterating through `k` and using a set) is efficient enough given the constraints.

Therefore, the program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
