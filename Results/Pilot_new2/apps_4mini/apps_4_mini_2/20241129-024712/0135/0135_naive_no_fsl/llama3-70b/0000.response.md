To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we analyze the logic implemented in the code against the requirements.

The program's goal is to check whether the remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, it checks if there are any pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i = n % j`.

### Analysis of the program:

1. The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the remainders that have been previously encountered.
3. It iterates over all integers `i` from `1` to `k` and computes the remainder `n % i`.
4. It checks if the computed remainder has already been seen (exists in the set `seen`).
   - If it has been seen, the program immediately prints "No" and exits, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If it has not been seen, it adds the remainder to the set and continues.
5. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the program prints "Yes".

### Edge Cases:

- When `k = 1`: The only computation is `n % 1`, which is always `0`. Thus, the output should be "Yes" because there are no pairs to compare.
- When `k = 2`: The program computes `n % 1` (which is `0`) and `n % 2`. Since `0` and the remainder of `n % 2` can potentially be equal, depending on `n`, this can lead to a "No" if both values are the same.
- For larger values of `k`, we need to ensure that all values of `n % i` for `i` from `1` to `k` yield distinct results.

### Problematic Cases:

1. **Case when n is less than k**: If `n < k`, the remainders `n % i` for `1 <= i <= n` will yield distinct values, but as soon as `i > n`, the remainders will repeat (all will be `n`). For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 5`, you compute:
   - `3 % 1 = 0`
   - `3 % 2 = 1`
   - `3 % 3 = 0` (which is a repeat)
   - `3 % 4 = 3`
   - `3 % 5 = 3`
   The output should be "No" because there are duplicates (0 and 3).

2. **Case when n = k**: This is interesting when `n` and `k` are equal. For example, `n = 4` and `k = 4` results in:
   - `4 % 1 = 0`
   - `4 % 2 = 0` (duplicate)
   Hence the output should be "No".

### Conclusion:

The program fails to account for situations where `k` is greater than `n`, leading to potential duplicates in the remainders. Therefore, the program does not produce the correct output for all possible inputs and edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
