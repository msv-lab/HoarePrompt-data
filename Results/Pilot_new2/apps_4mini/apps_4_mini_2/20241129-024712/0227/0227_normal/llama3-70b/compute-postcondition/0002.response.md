The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` indicates that `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers, and thus `a` can be sorted without any issues. The state of `n` remains unchanged, and the other variables remain unaffected except for `a`, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers.**
