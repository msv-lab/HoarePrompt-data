The value of `can_form` is assigned to `True`, changing its previous value of `False`. The other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `assigned` contains `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in `assigned`.
