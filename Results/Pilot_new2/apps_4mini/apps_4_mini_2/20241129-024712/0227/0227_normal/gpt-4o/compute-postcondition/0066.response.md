The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and the parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, it returns the count `m` of elements in `a` that could not be formed from differences of previously assigned integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers `a`, and return the count of those integers in `a` that cannot be represented as differences of previously assigned integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers, and returns the count of elements in a that cannot be formed from differences of previously assigned integers.**
