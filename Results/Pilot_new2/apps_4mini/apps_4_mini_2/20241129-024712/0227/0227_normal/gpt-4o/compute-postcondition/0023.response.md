The code `assigned.add(a[i])` adds the element `a[i]` to the set `assigned`. The variable `i` is at least 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, so `a[i]` is a valid index as long as the length of `a` is greater than `i`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is at least 2, `assigned` contains elements from `a` corresponding to indices less than `i`, and `assigned` now includes the element `a[i]`.**
