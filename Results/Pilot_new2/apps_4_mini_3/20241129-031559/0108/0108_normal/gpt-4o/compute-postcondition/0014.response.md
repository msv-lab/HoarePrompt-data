The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was previously less than 26, after the increment, `j` will either remain less than 26 or become equal to 26, depending on its initial value. The other variables (`s` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length greater than 1; `j` is now greater than or equal to its previous value and less than or equal to 26; `i` must be less than len(s)**.
