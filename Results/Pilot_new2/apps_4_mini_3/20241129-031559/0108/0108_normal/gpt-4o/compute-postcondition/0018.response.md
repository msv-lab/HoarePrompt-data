Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to the number of characters from `target` that were found in `s` in order, which is between 0 and 26. If `j` is less than 26, then not all characters of `target` were found in `s`. If `j` is 26, then all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order. The current value of `j` is equal to `target_len`, indicating that all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order.***
