To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the `while` statement. The loop will execute as long as both `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are true.

1. The variable `i` is currently 0.
2. The variable `len(s)` is the length of the string `s`, which is guaranteed to be at least 1 (as stated in the problem).
3. The variable `j` is currently 0.
4. The variable `target_len` is defined as 26.

Given these points, let's analyze the conditions:

- The loop will continue if `i` (0) is less than `len(s)` (which is at least 1) and `j` (0) is less than `target_len` (26). Since `i` is currently 0 and `len(s)` is at least 1, the first condition (`i < len(s)`) is satisfied. 
- The second condition (`j < target_len`) is also satisfied because `j` is 0 and `target_len` is 26.

Since both conditions are fulfilled, the loop can execute one time with the current state.

Thus, no adjustments are needed in the current state to allow the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
