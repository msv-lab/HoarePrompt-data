The function accepts a string `s` composed of lowercase English letters and processes it to create a new string `res` consisting of repeated instances of each character from 'a' to 'z' based on their occurrences in `s`. If `s` contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet at least once, the function prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. Additionally, if `s` contains any characters outside the range of 'a' to 'z', those characters will not affect the output since only the first occurrence of each letter is replaced.
