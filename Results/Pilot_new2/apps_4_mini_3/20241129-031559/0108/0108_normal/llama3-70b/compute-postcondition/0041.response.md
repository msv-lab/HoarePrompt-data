Postcondition: ***`s` is an empty string. If the length of `res` is equal to 26, then the value of `res` is printed. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string, `res` contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to 'z' based on their occurrences in the original string, `char` is 'z', and the length of `res` is not equal to 26.***
