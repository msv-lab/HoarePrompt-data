The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. Given that `char` is `final_char + 2` and `final_char` is less than 'y', we can safely determine that `char` will also be less than 'y'. The value of `s` will change by replacing only the first instance of `char` with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. 

To summarize:
- `s` is altered as the first occurrence of `char` is replaced with its successor.
- The other variables (`original_s`, `final_char`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` contains characters with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character following it in the ASCII table; `char` is `final_char + 2`; `res` contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to `final_char` followed by additional instances of `char`; `original_s` must have contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`; `final_char` is less than 'y'.**
