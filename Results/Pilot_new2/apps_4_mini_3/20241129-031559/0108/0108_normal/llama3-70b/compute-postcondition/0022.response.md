The variable `res` is being incremented by `char`. Since `char` is defined as `final_char + 2`, and `final_char` is less than 'y', this means that `char` must also be less than 'y' (as adding 2 to a character that is less than 'y' will still yield a character less than 'y' if 'y' is not included). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` must contain `char`, `char` is `final_char + 2`, `final_char` is less than 'y', and `res` is updated to include `char`.

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`, `char` is `final_char + 2`, `final_char` is less than 'y', `res` is updated to include `char`.**
