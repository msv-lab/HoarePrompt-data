Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10 with `k` not equal to 0. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90` and then `dp[n, k]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
