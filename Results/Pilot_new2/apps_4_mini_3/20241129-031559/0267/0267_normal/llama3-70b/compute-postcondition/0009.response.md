The variable `dp` is updated with the key `(n, k)` being assigned the value `9`. The initial conditions specify that the pair `(n, k)` is not found in `dp`, which indicates that it is a new entry being added. The other variables `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged, and no additional calculations or updates occur to them. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new entry in `dp` while retaining the original values of `l`, `r`, and `k`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10 and `k` is not equal to 0; `dp[n, k]` is 9.**
