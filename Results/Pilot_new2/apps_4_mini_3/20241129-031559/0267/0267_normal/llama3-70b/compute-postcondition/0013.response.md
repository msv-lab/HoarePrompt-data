The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding a calculated value. The expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` needs to be evaluated. Given that `i` is 2, we can substitute this into the expression:

1. The term `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `9 * 10 ** (2 - 1)` which equals `9 * 10^1 = 90`.
2. The term `10 ** (k - i)` becomes `10 ** (k - 2)`.
3. The term `10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** (2 - 1)`, which is `10`.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
- `dp[n, k] += 90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`

Since `dp[n, k]` is initially a multiple of 9 equal to `9 * 10^(k - 1)`, the updated value will depend on the current value of `dp[n, k]` and the result of the calculation.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`, `i` is 2.**
