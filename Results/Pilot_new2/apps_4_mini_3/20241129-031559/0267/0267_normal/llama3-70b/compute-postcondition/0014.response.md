According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as the variable `i` is less than `k`. The current state indicates that `i` is currently less than `k`, and the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is currently in the range of 1 to `k-1` (because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `k`), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, if `i` is currently `x`, then for the loop to execute again, the new value of `i` must be `x + 1`. 

Given that `k` is constrained between 2 and 10, and `i` must be less than `k`, this means that `i` could currently be at most `k - 1`, which must then be true for `k` to be at least 2. 

Assuming that the next value of `i` will be some integer that is less than `k`, the adjusted state would reflect the increment of `i` by 1.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90 * (10`, `i` is the next integer after the current value of `i`, which is less than `k`.**
