The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's examine the key issues:

1. **Range Iteration and Performance**: The program uses a simple loop to iterate through every integer from `l` to `r`, checking each number to see if it contains at most `k` different digits. This approach is not feasible for large values of `l` and `r`, especially given that they can be as large as \(10^{18}\). For example, if `l` is 1 and `r` is \(10^{18}\), this would require iterating through an astronomically large number of integers, leading to performance issues that violate the constraints of the problem.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Digits**: While `func_1` correctly determines if a number has at most `k` different digits, the overall logic does not consider the efficient aggregation of sums or the mathematical insights that could be applied based on digit patterns. The problem can often be solved using combinatorial counting or mathematical formulas based on properties of numbers rather than iterating through each integer.

3. **Global Variable Usage**: The variable `MOD` is referenced in `func_2`, but it is not defined within the function or passed as a parameter. This will lead to a runtime error unless `MOD` is defined globally elsewhere in the code.

4. **Output Format**: The program returns the total sum modulo `998244353`, but there is no indication within the provided code that this variable is defined or used correctly. As a result, it does not guarantee that the output will always be correct when the sum exceeds this modulus.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential cases, particularly for large ranges. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program can be summarized as follows:

Correctness: **False**
