The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to its current value. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0. Therefore, `total_sum` becomes `(0 + num) % MOD`. Since `num` is `l`, the resulting expression for `total_sum` is `l % MOD`. The other variables retain their values, specified as follows: `num` is `l`, `l` is at least 1, and `r` is at least `l` and less than \(10^{18}\). 

Output State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`, `l` is at least 1, `r` is at least `l` and less than \(10^{18}\)**.
