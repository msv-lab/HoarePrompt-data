Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic to understand why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number, and the difference between any two neighboring elements, respectively.

2. **Special Case for c = 0**: 
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence consists of only the element `a`. Therefore, the program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". 
   - This is correct because if `c` is zero, there are no other elements in the sequence besides `a`.

3. **General Case for c â‰  0**: 
   - The program calculates whether `(b - a) % c == 0` which checks if `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, ensuring that `b` is not reached by stepping in the negative direction when `c` is positive.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if both conditions are satisfied, indicating that `b` appears in the sequence, and "NO" otherwise.

### Edge Cases Covered:
- When `c = 0`, it correctly handles the scenario where only the first element exists.
- It correctly checks the arithmetic condition for both positive and negative values of `c`.

### Conclusion:
All given examples from the problem description are handled correctly, and the program logically accounts for the potential edge cases. Therefore, I believe the program's correctness is affirmed, and it meets the requirements of the problem description without any missed cases.
