The code snippet consists of a print statement, which outputs 'YES'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the print statement confirms that the condition (a == b) is satisfied. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. The current value of `c` is 0. The values of `a` and `b` are equal (a == b). Output is 'YES'.**
