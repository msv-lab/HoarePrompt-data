Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference (b - a) is divisible by c and (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, if the difference (b - a) is not divisible by c or (b - a) / c is negative, 'NO' has been printed.***
