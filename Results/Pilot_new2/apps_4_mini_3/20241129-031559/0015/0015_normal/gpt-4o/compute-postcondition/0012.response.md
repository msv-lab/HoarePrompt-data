Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input, with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed to the console. If `c` is not equal to 0, then if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
