The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` will take a single line of input, split it into separate strings, convert them into integers, and assign them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are overwritten by these new integer values. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but does not specify what those values are since they are based on user input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers based on user input.**
