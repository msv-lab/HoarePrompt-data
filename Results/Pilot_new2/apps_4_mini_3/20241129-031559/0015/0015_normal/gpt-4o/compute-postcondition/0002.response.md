The code snippet simply prints "YES" to the output. It does not change any variable values. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that the values of the variables are still the same as in the initial state. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input. The current value of `b` is equal to the current value of `a`.**
