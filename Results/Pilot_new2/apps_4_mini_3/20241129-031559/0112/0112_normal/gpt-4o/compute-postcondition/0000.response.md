Given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and each of the next `n` lines contains 6 integers `a_{i}_{j}` where 0 ≤ `a_{i}_{j}` ≤ 9 representing the digits on the faces of the cubes, the code snippet provided is:

```
digits = list(str(num))
```

In this code, the variable `num` would typically need to be defined in the context of the program for `digits` to be assigned a value. However, since `num` is not mentioned in the initial state, we will assume it is an integer representing a concatenation of the digits on the cubes or some value derived from the cubes.

Assuming `num` is valid and is an integer derived from the provided digits, the impact of the code is:

- The `num` variable is first converted to a string using `str(num)`.
- Then, `list(str(num))` converts this string into a list of its individual characters (digits).

The output state will reflect that `digits` is now a list containing the string representation of each digit in `num`. Since the exact value of `num` is unknown, we will leave it unspecified in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`.**
