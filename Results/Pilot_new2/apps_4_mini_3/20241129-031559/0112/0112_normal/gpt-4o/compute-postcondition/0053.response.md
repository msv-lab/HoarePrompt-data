Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `found` is set to True, and `used_cubes[i]` is marked as True, indicating that this cube has been used. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
