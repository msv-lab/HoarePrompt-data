The code `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the value at index `i` of the list `used_cubes` to `True`. The variable `i` has a value of `2`, which means that the third element of the `used_cubes` list is being set to `True`. Other variables, such as `n`, `digits`, `digit`, and `found`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Given that:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3,
- `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character,
- `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list,
- `found` is True,
- `i` is 2.

After executing the code, the only change is that `used_cubes[2]` is set to `True`. The output state reflects this update while maintaining the rest of the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[2]` is True.**
