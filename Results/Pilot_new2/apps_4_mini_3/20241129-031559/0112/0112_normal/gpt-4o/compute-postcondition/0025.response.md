The value of `found` is changed from True to False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, and `used_cubes` reflects the cubes that were used, marked as True for those that matched the condition.
