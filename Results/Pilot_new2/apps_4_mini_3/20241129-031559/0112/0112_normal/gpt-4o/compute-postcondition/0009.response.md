Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, and `i` is 0; if `used_cubes[0]` was not used and `digit` is in `cube_faces[0]`, then `used_cubes[0]` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
