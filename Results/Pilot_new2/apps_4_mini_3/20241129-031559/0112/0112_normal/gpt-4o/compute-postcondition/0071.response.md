Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be matched to the available cubes represented by `cube_faces`. It returns `True` if all digits are found on the cubes, with each cube being used only once; otherwise, it returns `False` if any digit cannot be matched, indicating potential issues such as a digit not being present on any cube or all available cubes being used.**
