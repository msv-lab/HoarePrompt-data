The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. Since it was already `True`, its value remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[2]` is True.**
