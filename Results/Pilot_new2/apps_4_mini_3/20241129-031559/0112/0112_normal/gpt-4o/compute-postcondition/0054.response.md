According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `i` has been incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since `i` is not explicitly defined at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume it is still within the valid range for `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be equal to the current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, which is less than `n`. If `i` is currently 2, which is the maximum value it could be for a valid next iteration given that `n` is at least 3, then `n` must be greater than 2, specifically at least 3, for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, if `i` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, and `i` will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is 3**
