The execution of the code does not change the values of the variables; instead, it causes a break from the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the output state remains mostly unchanged except for the flow of execution.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[2]` is True, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
