Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters; `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list; if `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `found` is set to True, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
