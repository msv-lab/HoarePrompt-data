#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and cubes is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes, with each integer in the range 0 to 9.

    #The program returns the maximum integer 'x' that can be formed using the digits from the faces of the cubes, where 'cubes' must include digits from 1 to 'x' and 'cube_faces' must contain sets including all digits from 1 to 'x'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` cubes, each represented as a list of 6 integers (digits 0-9). It returns the maximum integer `x` such that all digits from 1 to `x` can be formed using the digits on the faces of the cubes. If there are any digits missing from the cubes that are required to form the sequential integers up to `x`, the function will stop increasing `x` and return the highest valid integer that can be formed.

    #The program returns True, indicating that all digits in 'digits' have been matched to the available cubes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be matched to the available cubes represented by `cube_faces`. It returns `True` if all digits are found on the cubes, with each cube being used only once; otherwise, it returns `False` if any digit cannot be matched, indicating potential issues such as a digit not being present on any cube or all available cubes being used.
