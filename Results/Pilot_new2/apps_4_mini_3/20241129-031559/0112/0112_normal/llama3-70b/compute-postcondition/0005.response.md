According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 2 lists of integers, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 1 list (which is `cube`), and since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it indicates that there can be more elements in `cubes`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least 2 lists in `cubes`, and `cube` will be the second list in the `cubes` list. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include new string representations of integers from `cube`.**
