The `digits` variable is assigned the value of an empty set. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers from user input; `digits` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers from user input; `digits` is an empty set.**
