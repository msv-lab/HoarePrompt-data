According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it indicates that there is at least 1 list in `cubes`. This means that for the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list. At the end of the last iteration, `cube` will be the last list in `cubes`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that:
- `n` must be at least 1,
- `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers,
- `cube` will initially refer to the first list in `cubes` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list containing at least 1 list of integers, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
