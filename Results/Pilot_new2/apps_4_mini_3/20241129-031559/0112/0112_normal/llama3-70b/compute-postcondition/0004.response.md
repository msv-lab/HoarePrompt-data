In this case, the code snippet updates the `digits` set with string representations of each integer in the `cube` list. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and `cubes` contains at least one list of integers, `cube` will contain the first list from `cubes`. The impact of the code is that the `digits` variable will have new string values added to it, derived from converting each integer in `cube` to a string.

The original values of `n`, `cubes`, and `cube` remain unchanged, but `digits` gets updated. The specific contents of `cube` are not known, but we know `cube` consists of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing at least 1 list of integers; `cube` is the first list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include new string representations of integers from `cube`.**
