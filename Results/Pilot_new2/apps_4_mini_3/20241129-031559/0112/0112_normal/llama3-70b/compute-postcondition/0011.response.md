The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the list `digits`. Since '0' is confirmed to be present in `digits`, its removal will change the content of the `digits` list. 

The initial state specifies that `digits` includes string representations of all unique integers from all lists in `cubes`, and '0' is specifically mentioned to be present in that list. Thus, after executing the code, '0' will no longer be part of `digits`.

Other variables such as `n`, `cubes`, and `cube` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the last list in `cubes`; `digits` includes string representations of all unique integers from all lists in `cubes` excluding '0'.**
