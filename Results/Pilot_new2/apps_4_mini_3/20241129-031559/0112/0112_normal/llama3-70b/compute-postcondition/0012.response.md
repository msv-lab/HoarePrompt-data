Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the last list in `cubes`; and `digits` includes string representations of all unique integers from all lists in `cubes`. If '0' is present in `digits`, then `digits` includes all unique integers excluding '0'.***
