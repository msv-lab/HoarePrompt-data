The variable `max_num` is assigned the value of the largest possible integer that can be formed by concatenating the string representations of the integers in `digits`, sorted in reverse order. The value of `digits` will dictate how this integer is formed. 

Given that `n` is constrained between 1 and 3, `cubes` consists of `n` lists of integers. After aggregating unique integers from these lists into `digits`, if '0' is present, it will be excluded from `digits`.

Thus, `max_num` will be the integer formed from the digits in `digits`, sorted in descending order. 

The values of `n`, `cubes`, and `cube` remain unchanged, as the only modification is the assignment of `max_num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the last list in `cubes`; and `digits` includes string representations of all unique integers from all lists in `cubes`; `max_num` is the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` sorted in descending order.**
