To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we will analyze the program's logic against the requirements outlined in the description.

### Problem Description Recap
Nikolay needs to cook compote using fruits in the ratio of lemons:apples:pears = 1:2:4. The task is to find the maximum number of whole fruits (lemons, apples, pears) that can be used to make the compote according to this ratio. The fruits must be used in whole numbers without breaking them down.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program takes three inputs: the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
   - It reads these values directly from user input, which is appropriate for the context.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**:
   - The program determines how many sets of the ratio can be made by calculating the minimum:
     ```python
     max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
     ```
   - This line correctly uses the constraints of the fruit ratio:
     - For each lemon, `2` apples are needed, hence `b // 2`.
     - For each lemon, `4` pears are needed, hence `c // 4`.
   - This ensures that the program will not exceed the available number of any type of fruit.

3. **Calculating Total Fruits Used**:
   - The total number of fruits used in the compote is computed as:
     ```python
     total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
     ```
   - This formula correctly computes the total based on the maximum number of lemons that can be used multiplied by their respective ratios.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of fruits that can be used, which aligns with the requirement to output the maximum total number of fruits.

### Conclusion
The program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem described. It correctly calculates the maximum number of each fruit type that can be used based on the provided ratio and outputs the total number of fruits utilized accordingly.

### Correctness
After analyzing all aspects of the implementation against the problem description, we conclude that the program correctly follows the requirements specified.

Correctness: **True**
