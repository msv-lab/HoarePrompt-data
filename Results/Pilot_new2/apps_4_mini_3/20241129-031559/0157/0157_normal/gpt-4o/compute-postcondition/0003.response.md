The code assigns `max_lemons` the value of the minimum among three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `c` is an integer (which can be positive, negative, or zero), the values for `b // 2` and `c // 4` need to be calculated based on `b` and `c`.

- `b // 2` is the integer division of `b` by 2.
- `c // 4` is the integer division of `c` by 4.

Since `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `c` is an integer that could be any value, the overall value of `max_lemons` will be the smallest of these three calculated values.

The output state must reflect the updated value of `max_lemons` while retaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer based on input, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
