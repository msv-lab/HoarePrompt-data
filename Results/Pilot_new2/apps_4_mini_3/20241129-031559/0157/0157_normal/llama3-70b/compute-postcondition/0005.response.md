The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. These parameters represent the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. All three parameters are positive integers, with the constraint that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function will produce an output based on these quantities. However, since the specific output behavior is not provided, we cannot describe the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively, within the range of 1 to 1000.**
