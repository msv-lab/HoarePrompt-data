Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to cook the compote in the specified ratio. 

Here's how the program works:

1. It reads inputs for the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is determined by the constraints of the other fruits: for each lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears are required.
3. The function `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed what can be supported by the available apples and pears.
4. The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`.
5. Finally, the total is printed.

This implementation correctly handles all specified cases, including when there are not enough fruits to make any compote (e.g., if `c` is less than 4, for example). 

Every test case provided in the problem description results in the expected output, confirming that the program functions as intended across all potential input scenarios within the given constraints.
