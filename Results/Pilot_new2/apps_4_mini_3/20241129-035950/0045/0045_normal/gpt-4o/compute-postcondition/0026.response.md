Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, and it first computes the minimum required sum (`min_sum`) of the first `k` positive integers. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates how many times `min_sum` can fit into `n` and distributes the remaining value across the first `k` integers to form a sequence. The function returns this sequence of integers, each incremented appropriately based on the remainder.**
