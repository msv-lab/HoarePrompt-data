The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`. Given that `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, we can substitute to find the value of `remainder`. The output state will reflect the new value of `remainder`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`; `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`; `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`; `remainder` is equal to `n - d * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`**.
