The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n`; `remainder` is equal to -1; `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`; `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
