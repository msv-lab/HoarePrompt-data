The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`, where `a` is a positive integer representing `n` (with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10) and `b` is a positive integer representing `k` (with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10). The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `n` and `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and returns the GCD of a and b.**
