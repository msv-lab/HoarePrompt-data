The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, with `a` taking the previous value of `b` and `b` taking the value of `a % b`. Given that `a` is a positive integer less than `k` and `b` is greater than 0, the new value of `b` will be less than its previous value since it is the modulus of `a` by `b`, which is less than `b` and greater than or equal to 0. The conditions that `a` is not a multiple of `b` and that both `a` and `b` maintain their constraints remain valid.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is equal to `a % b` (less than the previous value of `b` and greater than or equal to 0), `a` is a positive integer less than `k`, `b` is greater than 0 and `a` must not be a multiple of `b`.**
