#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10), b is a positive integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10), and it is possible to form a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers that sum to n.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the GCD of the original values of `n` and `k`.
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the GCD of the original values of n and k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and it calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
