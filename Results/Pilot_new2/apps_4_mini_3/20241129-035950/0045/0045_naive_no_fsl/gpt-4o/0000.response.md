To determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and identify any edge cases that might not be handled correctly.

The program is designed to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized. The program does the following:

1. It calculates the minimum sum needed to create `k` strictly increasing positive integers, which is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If this minimum sum is greater than `n`, it returns `-1`, as it is impossible to create such a sequence.
2. It computes a scaling factor `d` which is derived from dividing `n` by `min_sum`, allowing the program to create a base sequence of multiples of `1, 2, ..., k`.
3. The program then calculates the `remainder` by subtracting the scaled minimum sum from `n`.
4. It constructs the sequence by initializing it with the multiples and then distributes the `remainder` across the last elements of the sequence to ensure that the sum equals `n` while the sequence remains strictly increasing.

Now, we will check for edge cases:

1. **Case where `k = 1`**: If `k` is 1, the only valid sequence would be `[n]`. The program does not explicitly handle this in the logic, but since `1` is included in the increasing sequence, the sequence will be `[d]` where `d` will equal `n`.

2. **Case where `n < k * (k + 1) // 2`**: This case is already handled by returning `-1`.

3. **Maximal GCD case**: The GCD should be the maximum possible divisor that can be applied to each element of the sequence. The implementation correctly calculates the base sequence based on the division of `n` by the minimum sum.

4. **Testing the return value**: If `n` is exactly the minimum sum, the program outputs `[1, 2, ..., k]`, which is valid.

5. **Edge case of very large numbers**: The program does not have any limitations regarding the size of `n` and `k`, but due to Python's handling of integers, this should not be an issue.

Overall, after reviewing the logic and testing these key potential edge cases, we see that the program correctly returns the expected output for valid inputs and handles the invalid scenarios as specified. 

Since no counterexamples were identified where the program fails to meet the problem requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program generates a valid sequence or returns `-1` when necessary, adheres to the problem requirements, and handles edge cases appropriately.
