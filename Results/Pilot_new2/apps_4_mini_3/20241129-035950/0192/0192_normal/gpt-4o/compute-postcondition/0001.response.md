To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we will analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved, specifically focusing on how the values of `x` and `y` change.

The code:
```
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

1. **Calculating the result**: 
   - The expression `(x - y)` represents the difference between `x` and `y`.
   - The result of `(x - y) // 2` gives the integer division of that difference by 2.
   - The expression `(x - y) % 2` yields the remainder when `(x - y)` is divided by 2, which will be either 0 or 1.
   - Therefore, the overall expression computes the value of half the difference `(x - y)`, rounded up to the nearest integer.

2. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The variables `x` and `y` are not modified at all during this operation; they retain their assigned input values.
   - The final result of the expression is printed but does not impact the state of `x` and `y`.

3. **Preconditions**:
   - The initial conditions state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, which holds true since no constraints are violated during the operation.

Thus, since `x` and `y` are integers with the specified conditions and no changes are made to their values, the output state will reflect their unchanged status along with the calculated expression result.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`, with values assigned from user input; expression result is `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.**
