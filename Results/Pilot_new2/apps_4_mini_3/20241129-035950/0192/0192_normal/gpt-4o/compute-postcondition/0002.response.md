The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers, with the relationship 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. The exact output of the function has not been specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details regarding the output based on the values of `x` and `y`, it is challenging to describe its full functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. The specific output of the function is not defined in the provided information.**
