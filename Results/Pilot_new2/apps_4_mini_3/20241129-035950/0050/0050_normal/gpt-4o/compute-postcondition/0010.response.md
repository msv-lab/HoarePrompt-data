To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the program with respect to the initial state.

1. **Variables**:
   - `n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30).
   - `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30).
   - `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000).
   - `s` is a list of `n` positive integers parsed from input.
   - `b` is a list of `m` integers parsed from input.
   - `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`.
   - `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b` (and it holds that `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`).
   - `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`.
   - `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles` will calculate the total amount of bourles after potentially selling the maximum shares at the maximum selling price.

3. **Calculations**:
   - `total_bourles` is assigned the value of `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, where:
     - `max_shares` is calculated from `r // min_buy_price`,
     - `remaining_bourles` is calculated from `r % min_buy_price`.

4. **Variables Affected**:
   - The variable `total_bourles` is newly created and assigned a value according to the calculations above.

5. **Output State**:
   - The initial state remains intact except for the addition of the `total_bourles` variable.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` positive integers parsed from input, `b` is a list of `m` integers parsed from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is equal to `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.**
