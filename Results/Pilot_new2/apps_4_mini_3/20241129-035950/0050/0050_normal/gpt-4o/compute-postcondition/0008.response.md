`max_shares` is assigned the value of `r // min_buy_price`. Here, `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000) and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, which is a list of `n` positive integers parsed from input (1 <= n <= 30). The states of the other variables are not affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` positive integers parsed from input, `b` is a list of `m` integers parsed from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, and it holds that `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`.**
