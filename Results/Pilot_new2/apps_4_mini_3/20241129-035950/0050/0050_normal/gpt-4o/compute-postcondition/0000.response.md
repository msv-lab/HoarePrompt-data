The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned from the input values. The previous values indicate that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 30, and `r` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000. The lists `s` and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000); `s` is a list of n positive integers where each integer s_i (1 <= s_i <= 1000) represents the price to buy shares; `b` is a list of m positive integers where each integer b_i (1 <= b_i <= 1000) represents the price to sell shares.**
