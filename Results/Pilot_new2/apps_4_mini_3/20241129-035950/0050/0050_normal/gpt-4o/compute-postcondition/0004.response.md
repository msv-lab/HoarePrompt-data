The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the value of the maximum integer from the list `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `min_buy_price` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The output state will include the unchanged variables along with the newly calculated `max_sell_price`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` positive integers parsed from input, `b` is a list of `m` integers parsed from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`.**
