The variable `b` is assigned a list created by mapping `int` over the result of `input().split()`, which means `b` will hold a list of integers generated from user input. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of integers generated from input, `b` is a list of integers generated from input.**
