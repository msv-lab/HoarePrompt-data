The variable `shares` is assigned the value of `0`. Since the initial value of `shares` is already `0`, there is no change in its value, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that there has been no change to any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is greater than 1, `shares` is 0, `r` remains unchanged, `i` is 2**
