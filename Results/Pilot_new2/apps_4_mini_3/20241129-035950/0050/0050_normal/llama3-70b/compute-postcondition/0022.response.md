Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, `shares` is updated by adding `r // s[1]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[1]`, with `i` set to 1. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, `shares` remains unchanged, `r` is unchanged, `i` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
