The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `shares` remains unchanged if `r` is less than `s[1]` or is updated by adding `r // s[1]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, `r` is updated to `r % s[1]`, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
