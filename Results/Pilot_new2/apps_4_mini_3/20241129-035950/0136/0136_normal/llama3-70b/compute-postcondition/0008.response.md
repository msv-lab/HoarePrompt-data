The code `print('>')` outputs a string but does not affect the values of any variables in the current state. The initial conditions regarding `a` and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, which may be empty if the input was all zeros; `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
