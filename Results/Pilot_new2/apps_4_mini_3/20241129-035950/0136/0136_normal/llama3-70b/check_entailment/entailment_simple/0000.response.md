Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully conform to the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Leading Zero Handling**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to strip leading zeros from the inputs `a` and `b`. While this works for most cases, it fails to account for the scenario where both numbers are completely composed of zeros (e.g., "0000" and "0000"). After stripping, both would become an empty string, which is not a valid representation of zero. The comparison would then be incorrect because it would treat two empty strings as equal when in fact both should be considered equal to zero.

2. **Output for Equal Numbers**: The program correctly outputs '=' when the stripped strings are equal, which is consistent with the problem description. However, the fact that it does not account for the case of both inputs being "0" (and leading to empty strings) is a flaw.

3. **Input Method**: The program does not use the recommended method of reading input. In Python 2, it should use `raw_input()`, which is mentioned in the problem description. If we assume the program is intended for Python 3, then `input()` is fine, but the specification should be clear about the expected Python version.

In conclusion, due to the leading zero handling and possible empty string comparison, the program does not correctly meet the requirements described in the problem statement. Thus, it can lead to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.
