Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, or '0' if `a` is empty; `b` is '0' if `b` is empty; `data` remains unchanged as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`; the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`.***
