You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".


-----Examples-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers represented as strings, each string may contain leading zeroes and has a length of at most 10^6 characters.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed. If `a` is empty, then `a` is '0' and `b` remains the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed. There is no change to the list `data` which remains as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, or '0' if `a` is empty. If `b` is empty, then `b` is set to '0', and `data` remains unchanged as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed or '0' if `a` is empty; `b` is '0' if empty; `data` remains unchanged as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`; and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output '>' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the output '=' is printed.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, or '0' if `a` is empty; `b` is '0' if `b` is empty; `data` remains unchanged as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. Otherwise, if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, or '0' if `a` is empty; `b` is '0' if it was empty; `data` remains unchanged as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; if the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '>' is printed to the output. If the lengths are equal, the outputs are determined by comparing `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed; if `a` is greater than `b`, '>' is printed; otherwise, '=' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, or '0' if `a` is empty; `b` is '0' if it was empty; `data` remains unchanged as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, '<' is printed. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '>' is printed. If the lengths are equal, the outputs are determined by comparing `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed; if `a` is greater than `b`, '>' is printed; otherwise, '=' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` in string format, removes any leading zeros, and compares their values. It prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, or '=' if they are equal. If either string is empty after removing leading zeros, it is treated as '0'. The function is designed to handle very large integers represented as strings, up to a length of 10^6 characters.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
