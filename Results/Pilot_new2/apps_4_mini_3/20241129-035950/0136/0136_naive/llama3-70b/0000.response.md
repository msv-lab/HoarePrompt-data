Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the comparison between two very long integers with leading zeroes. Specifically, the logic of removing leading zeros only works well for cases where both integers could still be equal after leading zeros are stripped. However, it fails in cases where one number has more significant digits due to leading zeros being removed.

For example:

Input:
```
0000000000000000001
00000000000000000001
```

Expected Output:
```
=
```

However, the program would strip the leading zeros from both numbers and compare:
```
a = '1'
b = '1'
```
It would return `=` correctly.

But if we check with a different edge case:

Input:
```
00000000000000000010
0000000000000000010
```

Expected Output:
```
=
```

The program would strip leading zeros and compare:
```
a = '10'
b = '10'
```
It would return `=` correctly here too.

However, if we input:

Input:
```
000000000001
000000000010
```

Expected Output:
```
<
```

The program would strip leading zeros and compare:
```
a = '1'
b = '10'
```
It would return `>` incorrectly.

The program fails for cases where the input numbers have different lengths after leading zeros have been removed, leading to potential errors in comparison. Thus, the program is incorrect.
