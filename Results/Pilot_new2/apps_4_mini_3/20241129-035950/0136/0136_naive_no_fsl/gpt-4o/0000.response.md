Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where both input numbers are entirely composed of leading zeros. For instance, if the input is:

```
00000000
00000000
```

The program would strip the leading zeros, resulting in both `a` and `b` being empty strings. The current logic would then treat them as `0`, leading to the correct output of `=`. However, if either `a` or `b` has leading zeros but is not equal to the other (like `00000001` vs `1`), it should also print `=` but only if they are indeed equal post-stripping. The program does handle this correctly, but it could be more efficient by directly comparing the original forms of numbers with leading zeros.

However, a more critical oversight is regarding the input format expectation of "non-negative integers". If an input includes non-numeric characters (e.g., a string like "abc"), the program will not handle this gracefully, leading to potential crashes or incorrect behavior, violating the assumptions in the problem description.

Thus, the program fails to cover all potential edge cases and is not robust against invalid input scenarios.
