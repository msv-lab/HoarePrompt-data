To analyze the correctness of the provided program, we need to break down the problem description and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The program is meant to calculate the probability that at least two people out of `k` have the same birthday in a year with `2^n` days, which is derived from the Birthday Paradox. 

1. **Understanding the Probability**:
   - The total number of outcomes for `k` people having their birthdays spread across `2^n` days is `total_days^k`.
   - The number of favorable outcomes (where no one shares a birthday) is calculated as:
     - For the first person, there are `total_days` options.
     - For the second person, there are `total_days - 1` options, and so on until the k-th person.
   - This gives us the probability of unique birthdays as:
     \[
     P(\text{no shared birthdays}) = \frac{total\_days \cdot (total\_days - 1) \cdots (total\_days - k + 1)}{total\_days^k}
     \]

2. **Event of Interest**:
   - The event we are interested in is the complement of the above:
     \[
     P(\text{at least one shared birthday}) = 1 - P(\text{no shared birthdays})
     \]
   - This can be expressed as a fraction where the numerator is:
     \[
     A = \text{total outcomes} - \text{favorable outcomes}
     \]
   - The denominator remains `total_days^k`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > total_days`, then it's guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday, and thus the probability should be `1` (i.e., `A = 1`, `B = 1`).

### Code Analysis:

- The code defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that calculates the probability of at least two sharing a birthday in a given manner.
- It correctly computes the numerator and denominator for the probability of no shared birthdays.
- It uses the `math.gcd` function to simplify the fraction.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Large Values of n and k**: The inputs can go up to `10^18`, making it impossible to compute `2^n` or perform multiplications for large `k` directly without running into performance issues or overflow errors. The current implementation does not handle this explicitly.
  
2. **GCD calculation**: The GCD is calculated on potentially very large numbers which could lead to inefficiencies.
  
3. **Modulo Consideration**: The problem states that A and B must be coprime **before** taking modulo `10^6 + 3`. The current implementation first reduces A and B modulo `10^6 + 3`, which may violate this condition.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified with handling large inputs and the order of operations with respect to modulo and GCD, the program is not guaranteed to return the correct values for all potential inputs, especially edge cases. 

Thus, the implementation does not satisfy the problem requirements correctly for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
