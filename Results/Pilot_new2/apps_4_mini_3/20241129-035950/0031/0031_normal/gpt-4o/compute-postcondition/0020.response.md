To calculate the impact of the code snippet provided, we will analyze the variables involved and how they change after execution.

1. `p_no_shared` remains unchanged and is equal to `numerator`.
2. `p_total` remains unchanged and is equal to `denominator`.
3. The code computes `p_shared` as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.

Based on the definitions:
- `total_days` is equal to `2^n`.
- `numerator` is the product of `((2^n) - i)` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`, modulo `1000003`.
- `denominator` is equal to `(total_days^k) % 1000003`.

Thus, we have:
- `p_no_shared = numerator`
- `p_total = denominator`

The calculation for `p_shared` becomes:
- `p_shared = (denominator - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003`.

Since the values of `numerator`, `denominator`, and `MOD` are known, but we don't have specific numeric values for `n`, `k`, or their results, we express the output state with the relations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `k` is less than or equal to 1 << n; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to `2^n`; `numerator` is equal to the product of ((2^n) - i) for i from 0 to k-1 modulo 1000003; `denominator` is equal to (total_days^k) % 1000003; `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`; `p_total` is equal to `denominator`; `p_shared` is equal to (denominator - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003.**
