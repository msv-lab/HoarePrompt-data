Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the function prints `1 1` and returns None. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates values based on the number of 'total_days' which is `2^n`, computes a numerator and denominator in a loop, and then calculates two values `A` and `B` based on these computations. Finally, it prints the results of `A` and `B` modulo `1000003`. The function itself does not return any value.**
