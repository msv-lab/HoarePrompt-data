The value of `denominator` is updated to be equal to `denominator * total_days % MOD`. Initially, `denominator` is 1, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, and `MOD` is 1000003. The new value of `denominator` would be `(1 * total_days) % 1000003`, which simplifies to `total_days % 1000003`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `k` is less than or equal to 1 << n, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is equal to 2^n, `numerator` is equal to (2^n) % 1000003, `denominator` is equal to (2^n) % 1000003, `i` is 0**
