The provided Python program aims to compute the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday among a group of `k` people when there are `2^n` possible birthdays. Let's analyze how the program aligns with the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly takes two integers, `n` and `k`, and checks if `k` exceeds `2^n`. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, it immediately returns `1 1`, which is correct since in this case it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday.

2. **Calculating Probabilities**:
   - The program initializes `total_days` as `2^n`, which is correct.
   - It computes the probability of no shared birthday using a loop that iterates `k` times. For each person added, it multiplies the current `numerator` by the available choices of days left (i.e., `total_days - i`), ensuring the calculation is done modulo `1000003` to manage large numbers. This is in line with calculating the probability of unique birthdays among `k` people.
   - The `denominator` is calculated as `total_days^k % MOD`, which is also correct as it represents the total possible combinations of birthdays for `k` people.

3. **Final Probability Calculation**:
   - The program computes the probability of at least one shared birthday as `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. This is a valid way to derive the probability of at least 2 people sharing a birthday from the total combinations minus the unique combinations.
   - It then simplifies the fraction to its irreducible form by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

4. **Output**: The program prints the values of `A` and `B` as required by the problem description. It ensures that they are coprime before taking their remainders modulo `1000003`.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description accurately, handling cases where `k` exceeds `2^n` correctly. It computes the required probabilities and formats the output as specified.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
