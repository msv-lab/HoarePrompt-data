Let's analyze the provided code and its adherence to the problem description step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to compute the probability that at least two people chosen from `k` individuals have the same birthday, given that there are `2^n` days in a year. The result should be presented as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

### Function Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - It computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It is implemented correctly and handles edge cases well (e.g., one of the numbers being zero).

2. **Function `func_2`**: 
   - It checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If so, it immediately prints `1 1`, which is correct as it means there is a 100% chance of sharing a birthday.
   - When `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates the probability of no shared birthdays and derives the values \( A \) and \( B \) for the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday. It also reduces \( A \) and \( B \) to their simplest form using the GCD from `func_1`. 

### Edge Cases
1. **Very Large Values of `n` and `k`**: 
   - Given the constraints where \( n \) and \( k \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), the calculations of `total_days = 1 << n` may lead to an overflow in practical implementations, but in Python, integers can grow arbitrarily large, so this is handled correctly in terms of Python's capabilities.
   - However, if `k` equals `2^n`, the logic should account for that properly, which it seems to do based on the provided checks.

2. **Modulo Operations**: 
   - The code correctly applies the modulo operation with \( 10^6 + 3 \). This is necessary to avoid overflow and is done before printing \( A \) and \( B \).

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints indicate that the function will correctly return coprime \( A \) and \( B \) modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \) as long as the conditions are met.

### Conclusion
The implementation correctly follows the description provided in all potential cases. It handles edge cases like when `k` exceeds `2^n` or when calculating large values of \( A \) and \( B \), ensuring they remain coprime and correctly reduced.

After considering all factors, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The solution adheres to the problem's requirements and handles each specified scenario correctly, including edge cases.
