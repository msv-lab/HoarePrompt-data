According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is an integer that satisfies the condition 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 1 and `k` must still be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to 2, `numerator` is equal to 2, `denominator` is equal to 2, `i` is 1**
