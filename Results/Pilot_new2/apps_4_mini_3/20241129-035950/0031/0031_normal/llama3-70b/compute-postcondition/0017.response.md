The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function returns (0, 1) if `k` is greater than or equal to 3; otherwise, it returns (1, 2) if `k` equals 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, and return specific tuples based on the value of `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, and returns (0, 1) if k is greater than or equal to 3; if k equals 2, it returns (1, 2).**
