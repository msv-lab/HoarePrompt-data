The variable `total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, which is `2` raised to the power of `n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \), `total_days` will be a very large integer value, specifically \( 2^n \). The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to `2 ** n`.**
