The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` must contain at least one index before execution, it will have at least one element, allowing `pop(0)` to successfully remove and return that first element. The variable `r_index` will now hold the value of the element that was at the front of `r_queue`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` now has one less index; `r_queue` has one less index than before, and `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation.**
