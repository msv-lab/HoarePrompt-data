The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to the `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` has been established as the first element that was in `r_queue` before the pop operation. Since `n` is a defined integer between 1 and 200,000, `r_index + n` will produce a new element that is equal to the sum of `r_index` and `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` has one less element; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue` before the pop operation; `r_queue` now has one less element and the new `r_queue` is appended with the value `r_index + n`; `r_index` is the element that was at index 0 of `r_queue` before the pop operation.**
