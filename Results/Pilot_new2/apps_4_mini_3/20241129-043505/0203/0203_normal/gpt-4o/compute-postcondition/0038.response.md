Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has one more element with the last element being `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` has one less element and `r_index` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` remains unchanged, and `r_queue` has one less element with the new `r_queue` appended with `r_index + n`.***
