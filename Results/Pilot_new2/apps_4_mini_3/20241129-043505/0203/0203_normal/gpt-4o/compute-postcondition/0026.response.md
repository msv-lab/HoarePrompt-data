Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has one more index equal to `d_index + n`, `r_queue` has one less index than before, and `r_index` remains the value of the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation. Otherwise, `d_queue` has one less index, `r_queue` has one more index with the last element being `r_index + n`, and `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.***
