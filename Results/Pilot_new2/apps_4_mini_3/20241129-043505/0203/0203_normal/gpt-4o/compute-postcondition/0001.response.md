The variable `votes` is assigned the value of the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. The precondition of `n` being an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 still holds.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**.
