The code `d_queue.append(d_index + n)` modifies the `d_queue` by appending a new element which is the sum of `d_index` and `n`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an input integer within a specified range (1 to 200,000), and `d_index` is the first element of `d_queue`. The `d_queue` will now include an additional element which is derived from these values.

The output state will reflect the updated `d_queue` and will maintain the values of the other variables that have not changed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` has an additional element `d_index + n` appended; `r_queue` has one less index; `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.**
