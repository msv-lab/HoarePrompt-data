Functionality: ** The function accepts an implicit positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of employees and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in `fractions`, and prints 'D' if there are more 'D's than 'R's; otherwise, it prints 'R'. There are no return values and the function relies on user input for both `n` and `fractions`. **
