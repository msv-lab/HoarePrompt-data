The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It counts how many distinct groups of integers exist in `a` such that each integer is not twice the previous integer. If the count exceeds 23, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count. It does not validate inputs and may fail if inputs are outside expected ranges.
