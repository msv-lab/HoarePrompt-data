`can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` must contain at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True.
