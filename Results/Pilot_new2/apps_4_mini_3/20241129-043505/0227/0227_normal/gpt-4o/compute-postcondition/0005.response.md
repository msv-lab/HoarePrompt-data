`can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False.**
