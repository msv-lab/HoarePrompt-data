The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` includes `a[2]`, `assigned` is not empty, `i` is 2, and the value of `a[2] - x` is an element of `assigned`, while `can_form` is `True`.
