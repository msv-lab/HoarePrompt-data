The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` must have at least 4 elements, `x` is the fourth element in `assigned`, `i` is 3, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
