The variable `b_block` is assigned the value `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The previous values of `b`, `m`, and `k` are maintained, and the operation computes the block for `b` based on its assigned value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input values; `a`, `b` are distinct integers assigned from input values satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where 1 ≤ a_floor ≤ m; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
