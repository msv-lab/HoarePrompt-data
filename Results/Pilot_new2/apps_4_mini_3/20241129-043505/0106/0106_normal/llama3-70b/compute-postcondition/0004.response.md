The variable `b_floor` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `b`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `a_floor`, and `a_block` are not affected, so their states remain the same. Specifically, `b_floor` is calculated based on the value of `b`, which is an integer satisfying `1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k`. Therefore, the value of `b_floor` will be an integer between 1 and `m`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from the input values; `a`, `b` are distinct integers assigned from input values satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where `1 ≤ a_floor ≤ m`; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`**.
