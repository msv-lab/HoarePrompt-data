The correctness of the provided program can be evaluated against the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of blocks (n), floors (m), and apartments per floor (k), as well as the apartment numbers (a, b). It ensures that all of these inputs are within their specified ranges.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks**:
   - It calculates the floor and block of the apartment `a` using:
     - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1` ensures a proper 1-indexed floor number.
     - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` provides the correct block number.
   - Similarly, it performs the same calculations for apartment `b`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Block Time**:
   - The program determines the minimum time required to traverse between blocks, taking into account the circular nature of the blocks and correctly using:
     - `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`
   This correctly computes the time to move horizontally between blocks.

4. **Calculating Minimum Floor Time**:
   - The program differentiates between cases where `a_floor > b_floor` and `a_floor <= b_floor`, correctly calculating the time taken to go vertically between floors.
   - It adds 10 seconds for the elevator wait time in all cases, which is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - Finally, it sums the block time and floor time correctly and prints the result.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimal time Edward can take to reach Natasha, adhering to all conditions and calculations outlined in the problem description. The conditions for moving between blocks and floors are handled as described, and the overall logic aligns with the requirements.

Thus, the program does meet the problem description specifications for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
