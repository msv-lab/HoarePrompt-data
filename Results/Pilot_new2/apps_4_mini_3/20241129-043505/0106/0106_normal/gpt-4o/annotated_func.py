#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and a and b are integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values returned by the function `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values returned by the function `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is greater than 1, `time_to_exit` is equal to `9 + floor_a`.
    direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15
    reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
    min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)
    time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5
    total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
    return total_time
    #The program returns total_time, which is calculated as the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor based on the values of floor_a, block_a, block_b, and floor_b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with integers `a` and `b` representing apartment numbers. It calculates the total time required to exit from apartment `a` to apartment `b`, considering the time to exit the floor of the starting apartment, the minimum walking time between the blocks, and the time to reach the target floor of the destination apartment. The function returns this total time. It handles the scenario where both apartments are on different floors and blocks, and it correctly calculates time based on the given building layout.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.
def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #The program returns the values of block and floor, where block is the block number calculated from the apartment number and floor is the floor number calculated from the floor_within_block.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `apartment`, calculates the corresponding block number and floor number within a multi-block structure defined by parameters `m` and `k`, and returns these two values. It does not check if the `apartment` number is valid within the range defined by `1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k`, potentially leading to incorrect results if an invalid apartment number is provided.
