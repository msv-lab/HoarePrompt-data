The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. Parameters `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers, constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. After executing the function body, it returns `total_time`, which is calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, based on the values of `floor_a`, `block_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts positive integers n, m, k, and integers a and b representing apartment numbers, and returns total_time, which is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.**
