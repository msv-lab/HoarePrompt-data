The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer such that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k, where n, m, and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and n, m, k represent the dimensions of the building structure. The function calculates two values: `block`, which is derived from the `apartment` number, and `floor`, which is derived from the `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding `block` and `floor` numbers based on the apartment's location within a defined multi-block structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the values of block and floor based on the calculated positions within a multi-block structure.**
