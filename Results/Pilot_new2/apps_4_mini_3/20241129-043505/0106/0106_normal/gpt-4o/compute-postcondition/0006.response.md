Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values returned by the function `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values returned by the function `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is greater than 1, `time_to_exit` is equal to `9 + floor_a`.***
