Given the initial state and the provided code snippet:

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values returned by the function `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values returned by the function `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is greater than 1, `time_to_exit` is equal to `9 + floor_a`; `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.

```
reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

1. The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned a value calculated from the expression `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
2. The values of `block_a` and `block_b` are used to calculate the absolute difference, which is then adjusted by `n` and multiplied by 15.
3. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`) remain unchanged in this step.

The output state will include the computed value of `reverse_walk_time` based on the above formula.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values returned by the function `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values returned by the function `get_location(b)`; `time_to_exit` is 0 if `floor_a` is 1, otherwise `time_to_exit` is equal to `9 + floor_a`; `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is equal to `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
