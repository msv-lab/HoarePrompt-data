The provided program is designed to calculate the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on several factors, including the building's layout, the time needed to use stairs or elevators, and the time required to walk around the building.

Let's review the components of the program in relation to the problem description:

1. **Floor and Block Calculation**: The function `get_location(apartment)` correctly determines which block ( подъезд ) and floor of the building the apartment number corresponds to. This is essential for calculating the time required to travel vertically (between floors) and horizontally (between blocks).

2. **Time to Exit the Block**: The program correctly calculates the time it takes for Edward to exit his block using the elevator. It considers two cases: if Edward is on the first floor, he exits immediately, or if he is on a higher floor, he waits 10 seconds for the elevator and then takes the time corresponding to the number of floors he needs to descend (1 second per floor).

3. **Walking Time Calculation**: The program calculates both the direct and reverse walking times between blocks. It uses the modulo operation to account for the circular layout of the building. However, there seems to be a minor mistake in the calculation of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. The current calculation assumes direct walking time only considers the absolute difference between the block numbers multiplied by the walking time per block (15 seconds). However, it does not factor in the wrapping around when going from block `n` to block `1`. This could lead to incorrect results in certain cases, particularly when the blocks are at the extremes of the circular layout.

4. **Time to Target Floor**: The time to reach Natasha's floor is calculated by multiplying the difference in floors by the vertical travel time (5 seconds per floor), which is correct as per the problem description.

5. **Total Time Calculation**: Finally, the total time is summed up as the program specifies, combining the time to exit, walking time, and time to reach the target floor.

### Issues Identified:
The main concern arises from the `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` calculations, which do not explicitly handle cases where the distance crosses over from the last block back to the first block (and vice versa). If Edward starts at block `n` and needs to reach block `1`, or starts at block `1` and needs to reach block `n`, it should also consider the circular distance accurately.

### Conclusion:
Overall, while the program implements most parts of the problem description correctly, the handling of the circular structure for walking time is flawed in that it could lead to incorrect total time calculations. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements as stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
