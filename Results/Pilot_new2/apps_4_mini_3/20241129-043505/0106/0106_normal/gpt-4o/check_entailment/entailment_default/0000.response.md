To analyze the provided Python program and determine its correctness against the problem description, let's break down the function logic and check for potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
The problem description outlines a scenario in a circular apartment building where Edward needs to reach Natasha's apartment from his own. The parameters provided (n, m, k) describe the number of blocks, floors, and apartments per floor respectively. The code must correctly compute the minimum time for Edward to go from apartment `a` to apartment `b`.

### Function Breakdown

1. **get_location Function**:
   - This function takes an apartment number and calculates its corresponding block and floor. 
   - The calculations seem logically structured based on the description, using integer division and modulus to find the block and floor within that block.

2. **func_1 Function**:
   - This function calculates the total time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
   - It considers:
     - Time to exit the floor of apartment `a` (which is correct, but only if he is not already on the first floor).
     - Walking time between blocks (both direct and reverse).
     - Time to reach the target floor of apartment `b`.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Same Floor and Block**: If Edward and Natasha live in the same block and on the same floor, the walking time should be zero, but the logic should handle this case explicitly. The code does not seem to account for this being a potential optimal scenario, since `min_walk_time` should also consider that case.
   
2. **Invalid Apartment Numbers**: The `get_location` function does not check if the apartment number is valid (i.e., whether it falls within the range of existing apartments). If an invalid apartment number were to be passed, it could lead to incorrect block or floor calculations.

3. **Parameters Bounds**: Although n, m, k are guaranteed by the problem constraints, if there were to be an assumption about minimum and maximum values for parameters, the program should ideally validate these scenarios to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints claim that the function correctly calculates the total time required, taking into account the necessary time to exit floors, the shortest walking path, and the time to reach the target floor. However, the hints also state that the function correctly handles scenarios where apartments are on different floors and blocks, which might not be entirely accurate without ensuring valid floor and block calculations.

### Conclusion
After reviewing both the function code and the potential edge cases, it is clear that the program does not handle an edge case where the apartment numbers are invalid (out of bounds) and also does not explicitly account for the case where both apartments are the same, which directly influences the time calculation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to validate apartment numbers and does not consider the case when both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor in the same block, which can lead to incorrect outputs.
