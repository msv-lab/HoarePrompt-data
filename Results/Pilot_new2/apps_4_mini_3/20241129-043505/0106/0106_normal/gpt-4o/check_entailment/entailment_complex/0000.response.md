To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic in the implementation relative to the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The program is aimed at calculating the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. The time is calculated based on:
   - The time to exit from Edward's apartment to the first floor.
   - The time to walk between the blocks (either clockwise or counterclockwise).
   - The time to reach Natasha's floor from the first floor of her block.

2. **Function `get_location`**: 
   - This function calculates Edward's and Natasha's block and floor based on the apartment number provided. This seems logically correct as it breaks down the apartment number into its respective block and floor based on the structure of the building.
   - However, the function does not validate if the `apartment` number is within bounds (i.e., between `1` and `n * m * k`). This could lead to incorrect results if an invalid apartment number is input. 

3. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - It calculates the time to exit based on whether Edward is on the first floor or not, which is consistent with the problemâ€™s description.
   - The program computes the direct and reverse walking times correctly considering the circular structure of the building.
   - The time to the target floor is also calculated accurately.

4. **Potential Issue**: 
   - Given that `get_location` does not check for the validity of the apartment number, there is a risk that if an invalid apartment number is supplied, the calculations for blocks and floors would be incorrect. This could lead to scenarios where the computed time does not make sense or exceeds the bounds of valid block and floor numbers.
   - The entire program heavily depends on `get_location` returning valid values based on the input. If it doesn't, the output could be nonsensical.

5. **Example Analysis**: 
   - Consider an edge case where `a` or `b` are greater than `n * m * k`. In such cases, `get_location` would produce invalid block and floor numbers which could lead to unhandled situations in `func_1`.

Conclusion: Since the program can potentially fail due to unvalidated apartment numbers leading to invalid calculations, it does not conform to the problem description for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**
