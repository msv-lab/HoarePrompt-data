Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 4 plus the number of successful iterations of the loop, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `count` is the total number of valid updates where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. If the loop does not execute, `count` remains 0.**
