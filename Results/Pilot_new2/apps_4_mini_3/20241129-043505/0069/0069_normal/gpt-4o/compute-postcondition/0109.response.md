Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 11 or `n + 11`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `balance` is 0, `results` is updated to either contain `-1` added to its previous elements if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, or include `0` along with the previous values if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`. Otherwise, `results` now includes the previous contents along with the value of `count`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` contains `n + 1` elements, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, and `i` is equal to `n`.***
