Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 4, `results` is either a list containing -1 (if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`) or a list containing [0] (if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`). `n` is an integer extracted from `data[1]`, `x` is int(data[2]), `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` for `i` in `1` to `n` is equal to the cumulative sum of `1` for '0's and `-1` for '1's in the substring `s[0:i-1]`, with the current value of `balance` being 0.***
