The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected by this action. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9; `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9; `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
