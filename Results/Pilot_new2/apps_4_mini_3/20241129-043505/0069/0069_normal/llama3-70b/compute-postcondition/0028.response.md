The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are updated to reflect the counts of '0's and '1's in the binary string `s`. The variable `balance` will also change as it depends on `cnt0` and `cnt1`. Since the specific values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are not known without the actual string `s`, we can only express them in terms of their counts.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an input integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is the binary string input, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `cnt0, cnt1 = s.count('0'), s.count('1')`.**
