Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description because it fails to handle the case where the counts of '0's and '1's are equal (i.e., `cnt0 == cnt1`). In such cases, the balance does not change, and the program would try to check `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)`, which results in a division by zero error. 

The conditions provided in the code do not account for this situation and do not correctly define when to return `-1` for infinite prefixes. Specifically, if `cnt0 == cnt1`, the balance remains constant and depends solely on the existing balance. If `x` matches this constant balance, the number of prefixes with that balance is infinite, and the program should return `-1`. However, if the balance does not match `x`, the program would fail to provide the correct output.

Thus, due to the unhandled case where `cnt0 == cnt1`, the program may produce incorrect results in certain scenarios, violating the requirements of the problem description.
