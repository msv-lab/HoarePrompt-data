The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. Given that `i` is 3, `remainder` will be the result of `n % 3`. The value of `remainder` will depend on the specific value of `n`, which is not provided but is constrained by `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `k` < `n`; `i` is 3; `seen_remainders` includes the value of `remainder` (which is `n % 2`); `remainder` is `n % 3`.**
