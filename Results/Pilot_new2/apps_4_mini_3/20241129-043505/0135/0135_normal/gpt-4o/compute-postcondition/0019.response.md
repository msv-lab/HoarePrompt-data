The code `seen_remainders.add(remainder)` adds the current value of `remainder` (which is `n % 3`) to the set `seen_remainders`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, except for `seen_remainders`, which now includes the new `remainder` value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is 3, `seen_remainders` includes the value of `remainder` (which is `n % 2` and now also includes `n % 3`), and `remainder` is `n % 3`.**
