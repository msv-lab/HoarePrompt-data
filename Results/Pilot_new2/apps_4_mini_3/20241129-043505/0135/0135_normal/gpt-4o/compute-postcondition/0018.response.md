Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is 3, `seen_remainders` includes the value of `remainder` (which is `n % 2`), and `remainder` is `n % 3`. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program does not return any specific value.***
