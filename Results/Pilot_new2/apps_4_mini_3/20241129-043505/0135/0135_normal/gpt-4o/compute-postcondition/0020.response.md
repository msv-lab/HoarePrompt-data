Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is equal to `k`, and `seen_remainders` contains all unique values of `n % i` for `i` in the range from 1 to `k`. If no remainder was repeated, the loop has executed `k` times; otherwise, it has terminated early.**
