The provided problem description states that we need to check if all remainders when dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. The program correctly implements this logic with the following steps:

1. It first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k >= n`, it returns `'No'`, which is correct because there will definitely be repeated remainders when `i` includes `n` (since `n % n` is `0`).

2. If `k < n`, the program initializes an empty set to keep track of seen remainders. The program then iterates over all integers from `1` to `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, and checks if this remainder has already been encountered:
   - If the remainder is already in the set, it returns `'No'`, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If the remainder is not in the set, it adds the remainder to the set and continues.

3. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the program returns `'Yes'`, confirming that all remainders from `n % i` (for all `i` in the range from `1` to `k`) are indeed distinct.

This logic directly aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function effectively checks all potential cases for distinct remainders based on the input constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed as follows:

Correctness: **True**

The program accurately handles all specified conditions and checks for distinct remainders as required by the problem description.
