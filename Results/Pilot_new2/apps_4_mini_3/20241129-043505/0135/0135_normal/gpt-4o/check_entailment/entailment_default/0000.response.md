To analyze the provided Python program and its correctness according to the problem description, let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Problem Description:**
   The problem requires checking if the remainders of the division of a number \( n \) by all integers \( i \) from \( 1 \) to \( k \) are distinct. Specifically, it states that if there exists any pair \( (i, j) \) such that \( 1 \leq i < j \leq k \) and \( n \mod i = n \mod j \), the function should return "No". If all remainders are distinct, it should return "Yes".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   The function `func_1` checks the following conditions:
   - If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \), it returns "No", which is correct because in such cases, the remainders from \( n \mod 1 \) to \( n \mod n \) will include the remainder for \( n \mod n \) which is always \( 0 \).
   - It initializes a set `seen_remainders` and iterates from \( 1 \) to \( k \) to compute \( n \mod i \). If a remainder is already in the set, it returns "No"; if not, it adds the remainder to the set.
   - If all remainders are distinct, it returns "Yes".

3. **Checking for Edge Cases:**
   - If \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 1 \): The only remainder is \( n \mod 1 = 0 \). The output should be "Yes" since there are no other remainders to compare.
   - If \( n = k \): According to the logic, it will return "No" since \( n \mod n = 0 \) will repeat with \( n \mod 1 \). This case is handled correctly.
   - If \( n < k \): This is also handled correctly as it will return "No".

4. **Verifying Output Hints:**
   The output hints state that the function returns 'No' if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \) or if any remainder from the division of \( n \) by integers from \( 1 \) to \( k \) has been seen before. This aligns with what the code is doing, confirming that the hints agree with the implementation.

5. **Conclusion:**
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles edge cases such as when \( k \) is equal to or greater than \( n \) properly. Given that we have not found any potential cases where the code fails to meet the problem's specifications, I conclude that the function is implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
