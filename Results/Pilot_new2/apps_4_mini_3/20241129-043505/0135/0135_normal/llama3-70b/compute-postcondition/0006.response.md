The execution of the `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, and as such, there are no changes to any of the variables. Hence, the output will reflect the unchanged state of the variables along with the fact that the program has terminated.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `seen` is a set that includes the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0; 'No' has been printed and the program has terminated.**
