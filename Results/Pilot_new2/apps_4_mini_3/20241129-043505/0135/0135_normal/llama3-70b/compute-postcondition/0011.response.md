The code simply outputs 'No' and does not change any of the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `seen` is a set that includes the value of `remainder` and 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and 'No' is printed.**
