To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and consider potential edge cases.

### Given Problem Description
The task is to check if the remainders of `n` when divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. We need to ensure that for every pair `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`, the condition `n % i ≠ n % j` holds true.

### Provided Program
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'

print(func_1(n, k))
```

### Logic Breakdown
1. **Initial Condition**: The program checks if `k >= n`. If true, it immediately returns 'No'. This is correct; if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders from `1` to `n` will include `0` (when `i = n`), leading to duplicates since `n % n = 0` and `n % (n-1)` can also produce a value of `0`.

2. **Set for Distinct Remainders**: The program uses a set `seen_remainders` to track already seen remainders. The loop iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i`.

3. **Distinct Check**: It checks if the current remainder has already been seen. If it has, it returns 'No'. If all remainders are distinct after the loop, it returns 'Yes'.

### Testing Edge Cases
1. **Case where `n < k`**: When `n` is less than `k`, the program correctly returns 'No' because it assumes that some remainders will be equal.

2. **Case where `k` equals `n`**: The program will also return 'No' due to the first condition. 

3. **Case where `k = 1` and `n = 1`**: The program returns 'Yes', which is correct since `n % 1 = 0` and there's no other `i` to compare.

4. **Potential Edge Case**: What if `k` is significantly larger than `n`, like `n = 5` and `k = 1000000000000000000`? The program would still operate correctly, as the distinct remainders for `1` to `5` will be `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`. However, if `k` is too large, it may lead to inefficient execution time, but that doesn’t affect correctness.

5. **Specific Example**: If we take `n = 8` and `k = 4`, we have the remainders:
   - `8 % 1 = 0`
   - `8 % 2 = 0`
   - `8 % 3 = 2`
   - `8 % 4 = 0`
   The remainders aren't distinct, but the program doesn't check for this scenario directly as it returns 'No' when `k >= n`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the logic and edge cases, it appears that the program does not handle cases correctly when `k` is larger than `n`, since it prematurely returns 'No' without checking for distinct remainders in some cases. 

Given these issues and potential cases where the output does not align with the requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**
