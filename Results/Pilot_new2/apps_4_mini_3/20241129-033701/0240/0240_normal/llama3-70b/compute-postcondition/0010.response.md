The value of `n` is updated by adding the character `c` to it. Since `c` is the third character of the string `s`, the value added to `n` will be the string representation of that character. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `n` without knowing its previous value and the content of `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string containing at least 3 digits, `c` is the third character of `s`, and `n` is updated to `n + c`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing at least 3 digits, `c` is the third character of `s`, `n` is updated to `n + c`.**
