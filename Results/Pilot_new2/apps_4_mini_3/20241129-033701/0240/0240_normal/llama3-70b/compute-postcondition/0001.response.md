The variable `n` is assigned an empty string `''`. The initial state of the other variables is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string containing digits with a maximum length of 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that may contain leading zeros; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`; `n` is an empty string.
