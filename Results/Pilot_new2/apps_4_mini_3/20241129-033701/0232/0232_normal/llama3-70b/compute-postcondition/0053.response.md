According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the variable `i`. The loop is defined to iterate from `i` to `n - 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `i` is currently set to 1, the loop can execute properly if `n` is greater than `i`, which it is since `1 < n`. 

At the start of the loop:
- `j` must be initialized to the value of `i`, which is 1, and it will increment until it reaches `n - 1`.
- Since `n` is at least 2 (as it must be greater than 1), when `j` starts at 1, there are valid iterations for the range.

Therefore, the states that need to be recognized for the loop to execute are:
1. `n` must be greater than 1.
2. `i` is initialized to 1.
3. `j` starts at 1 (the same value as `i`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `window_counts` is an empty dictionary; `found` remains True.**
