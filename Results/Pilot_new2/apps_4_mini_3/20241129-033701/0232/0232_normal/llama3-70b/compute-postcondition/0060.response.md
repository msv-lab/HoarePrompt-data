The value of `found` is assigned the boolean value `True`, which it already holds. Therefore, there are no changes to the state of the variables due to this assignment. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `window_counts[color]` is 1; `found` is True; `color` is equal to `colors[1]`; the values of `window_counts` sorted and `counts` match, indicating that for all count and target pairs derived from `window_counts` and `counts`, the count equals the target.**
