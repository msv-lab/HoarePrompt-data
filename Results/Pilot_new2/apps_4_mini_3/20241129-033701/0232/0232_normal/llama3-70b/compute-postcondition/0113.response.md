The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from `colors[2]` to `colors[n-1]`, and `found` is True, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
