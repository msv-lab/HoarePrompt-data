The statement `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the count of `color` in the `window_counts` dictionary. The variable `color` is equal to `colors[1]`, and if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then it is assigned the value 0 before this increment operation.

If `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, it is now added with a value of 1. If it was present, its value is increased by 1.

The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `color` is equal to `colors[1]`, and now `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or the previous value of `window_counts[color]` plus 1.**
