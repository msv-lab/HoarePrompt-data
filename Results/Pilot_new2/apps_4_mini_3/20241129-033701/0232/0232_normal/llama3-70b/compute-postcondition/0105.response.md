The variable `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `window_counts[color]` is unknown, but it was previously incremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `color` is `colors[4]`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `color` is `colors[4]`, and `window_counts[color]` is 0.**
