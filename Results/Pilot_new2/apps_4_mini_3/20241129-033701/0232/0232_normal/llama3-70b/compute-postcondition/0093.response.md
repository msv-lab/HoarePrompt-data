The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
