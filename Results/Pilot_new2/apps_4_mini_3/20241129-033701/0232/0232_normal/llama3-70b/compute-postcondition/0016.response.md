The code snippet `color_counts[color] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `color` in the `color_counts` dictionary by 1. This means that if `color` is not already present in `color_counts`, it will start from 0 and then be incremented to 1. The initial constraints ensure that `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `colors`, `counts`, and the condition of `color_counts[color]` being 0 if `color` is not present are also preserved.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `counts` is a list of integers derived from input values; `color` is the next color in the list; `color_counts[color]` is now incremented by 1.**
