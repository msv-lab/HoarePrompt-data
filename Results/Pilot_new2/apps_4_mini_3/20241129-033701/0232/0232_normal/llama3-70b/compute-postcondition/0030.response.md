Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, `j` is 0, and `color` is equal to `colors[0]`. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
