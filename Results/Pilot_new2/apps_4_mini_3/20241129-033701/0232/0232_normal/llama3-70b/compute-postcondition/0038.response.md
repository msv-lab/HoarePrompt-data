Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `color` is equal to `colors[1]`, `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or the previous value of `window_counts[color]` plus 1. If the counts of `window_counts` match the target counts, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
