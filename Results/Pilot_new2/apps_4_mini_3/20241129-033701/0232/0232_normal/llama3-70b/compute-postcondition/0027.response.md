Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, `j` is 0, `color` is equal to `colors[0]`, and the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts` values (i.e., for all counts and target pairs, count equals target).***
