The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `j` is `n - 1`; `found` is True; `window_counts` contains the counts of each color in `colors` from index 1 to `n - 1; and all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
