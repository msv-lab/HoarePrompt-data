The variable `color_counts` is updated by incrementing the count for the `color`. Given that `color` is not already in `color_counts`, it was initialized to 0 before the increment operation. Therefore, `color_counts[color]` becomes 1 after the operation. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `counts` is a list of integers derived from input values; `color` is the next color in the colors list; `color_counts[color]` is 1.**
