n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, the second input line contains n integers each in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing the colors of the lightsabers, and the third input line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} where 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n, representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color.
