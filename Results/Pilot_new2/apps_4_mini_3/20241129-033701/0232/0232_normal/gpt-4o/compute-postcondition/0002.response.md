The variable `left` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state, so they remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of `k` is between 1 and `n` (1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n), `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer default values initialized to 0, `left` is 0.**
