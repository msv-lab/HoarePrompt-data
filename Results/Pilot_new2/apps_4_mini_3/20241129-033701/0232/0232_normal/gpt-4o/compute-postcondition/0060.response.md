Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0, `left` is equal to the original value of `left` plus the total number of times the inner loop executed; `current_counts[color]` for each `color` in `desired_counts` is less than or equal to `desired_counts[color]`, indicating that the entire loop has finished executing and not all required counts have been met; the loop has executed until it could not satisfy the condition of having `current_counts[color]` equal to `desired_counts[color]` for every `color` in `desired_counts`.**
