Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0, `left` is incremented by 1, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1. The condition regarding the counts of colors may still be checked but is not directly affected, and the program may still return 'YES' based on the count equality.**
