Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0

```
current_counts[colors[right]] += 1
```

Now, please think step by step: The code increments the value of `current_counts` at the index corresponding to `colors[right]`. The value of `right` is 0, which means that `colors[right]` is equal to `colors[0]`. The specific values of `current_counts` and `colors` are not provided, but we can determine that `current_counts[colors[0]]` will be incremented by 1. The other variables (`n` and `right`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0, `current_counts[colors[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
