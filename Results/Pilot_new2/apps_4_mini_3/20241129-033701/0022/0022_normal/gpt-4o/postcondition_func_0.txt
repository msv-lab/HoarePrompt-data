The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center. It returns `False` if any mismatch is found, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome. If all compared characters match, it returns `True`, confirming that `s` is a palindrome. The function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty strings or strings that are not composed solely of English letters, but it assumes `s` is of valid length and content based on the preconditions.
