#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting only of English letters (both uppercase and lowercase).
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of length `n`, `n` is even then `s` is a palindrome if all characters checked are equal, `n` is odd then `s` is also a palindrome if all characters checked are equal.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the string 's' is a palindrome regardless of whether its length 'n' is even or odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center. It returns `False` if any mismatch is found, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome. If all compared characters match, it returns `True`, confirming that `s` is a palindrome. The function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty strings or strings that are not composed solely of English letters, but it assumes `s` is of valid length and content based on the preconditions.
