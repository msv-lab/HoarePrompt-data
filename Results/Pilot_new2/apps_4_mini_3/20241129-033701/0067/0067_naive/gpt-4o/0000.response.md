To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic.

The program reads three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). It computes the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the unknown votes `z`:

- `min_upvotes` is simply `x` (the known upvotes).
- `max_upvotes` is `x + z` (if all unknown votes are upvotes).
- `min_downvotes` is simply `y` (the known downvotes).
- `max_downvotes` is `y + z` (if all unknown votes are downvotes).

The program then checks the following conditions:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints '-'. This means that the maximum possible upvotes are still less than the minimum possible downvotes, leading to a definitive negative result.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints '+'. This means that the maximum possible downvotes are still less than the minimum possible upvotes, leading to a definitive positive result.
3. If neither of the above cases is true, it prints '?', indicating that the result is uncertain since there are scenarios where both outcomes are possible.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Case when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`**:
   - Expected output: '0' (since there are no votes at all).
   - The program would output '?' because max_upvotes (0) is not less than min_downvotes (0), and max_downvotes (0) is not less than min_upvotes (0), which means it fails this scenario.

2. **Case when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`**:
   - Expected output: '?' (there's one unknown vote that can either be an upvote or a downvote).
   - The program would output '?' correctly in this case.

3. **Case when `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`**:
   - Expected output: '?' (one upvote, one downvote, and one unknown vote that can change the outcome).
   - The program would output '?' correctly in this case.

4. **Case when `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`**:
   - Expected output: '0' (one upvote and one downvote).
   - The program would output '?' because max_upvotes (1) is not less than min_downvotes (1), and max_downvotes (1) is not less than min_upvotes (1).

From these evaluations, we can see that there are multiple scenarios where the program fails to produce the expected output according to the problem statement.

Thus, the program does not behave as required for all cases. 

Correctness: **False**.
