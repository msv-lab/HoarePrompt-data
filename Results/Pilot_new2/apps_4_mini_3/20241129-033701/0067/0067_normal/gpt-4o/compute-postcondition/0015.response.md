Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input (where each integer is between 0 and 100 inclusive) and evaluates them to determine the relationship between maximum upvotes and downvotes. It outputs '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, or '?' if neither condition is met. The function does not return any value, it only prints the results. **
