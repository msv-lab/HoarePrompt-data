The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the assumption that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100 inclusive. However, since there are no specified output conditions provided, the functionality cannot be fully described regarding what it returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is that it does not take any parameters and operates with integer variables `x`, `y`, and `z` that are constrained within specified limits, but the exact output is not clear.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on integers x, y, and z that are constrained between 0 and 100 inclusive, but the return value is not specified.**
