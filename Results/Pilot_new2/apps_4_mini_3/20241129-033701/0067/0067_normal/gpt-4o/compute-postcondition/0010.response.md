Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer between 0 and 100; `z` is an integer between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; and `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z >= y`); and `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes` (i.e., `y + z >= x`).***
