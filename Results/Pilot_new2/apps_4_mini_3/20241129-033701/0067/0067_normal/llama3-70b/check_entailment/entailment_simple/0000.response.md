To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program in relation to the requirements specified.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` where:
   - `x`: number of known upvotes
   - `y`: number of known downvotes
   - `z`: number of unknown votes
2. **Output**:
   - If upvotes exceed downvotes after considering unknown votes, output `+`.
   - If downvotes exceed upvotes, output `-`.
   - If upvotes and downvotes are equal, check `z`:
     - If `z` is zero, output `0`.
     - If `z` is greater than zero, output `?` (indicating uncertainty).
3. **Uncertainty**: The output is uncertain if there are different possible outcomes based on how the unknown voters vote.

### Program Logic:
```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z):
        print('+')
    else:
        if (x < y):
            print('-')
        else:
            if (x == y):
                if (z == 0):
                    print('0')
                else:
                    print('?')
            else:
                print('?')
```

### Explanation of the Logic:
1. **If `x > y + z`**: 
   - This condition checks if the known upvotes are greater than the maximum possible downvotes (downvotes + unknown votes). If this condition is true, it will definitely output `+`.
  
2. **If `x < y`**: 
   - This checks if known upvotes are less than known downvotes. If true, it outputs `-`.
  
3. **If `x == y`**:
   - If the known votes are equal, it checks:
     - If `z` is `0`: there is no uncertainty, so it outputs `0`.
     - If `z > 0`: there exists the possibility of either upvotes or downvotes from the unknowns. Thus, it outputs `?` indicating uncertainty.

4. **Else Statement**:
   - The handling of the case where `x` is not equal to `y` has an oversight. It is redundant since if `x` is not greater than or equal to `y`, then we have already handled the cases for `x < y` and `x == y`.

### Correctness Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic for determining the voting outcome based on the provided problem description. It systematically checks the conditions for determining if the outcome is a clear `+`, `-`, `0`, or `?` based on the combination of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
- There are no cases that are missed or misrepresented according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct:

Correctness: **True**
