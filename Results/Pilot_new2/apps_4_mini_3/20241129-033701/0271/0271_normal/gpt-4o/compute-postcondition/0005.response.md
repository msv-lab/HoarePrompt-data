The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`, and it is specified that `remainder` is greater than 5. This implies that `remainder` can take values of 6, 7, 8, or 9. Consequently, the expression `10 - remainder` will yield values of 4, 3, 2, or 1 respectively. Therefore, `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Since `remainder` is greater than 5, we can express `result` in terms of `n`:
- If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + 4`
- If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + 3`
- If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + 2`
- If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + 1`

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is equal to `n % 10` and is greater than 5; `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is equal to `n % 10` and is greater than 5; `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`.**
