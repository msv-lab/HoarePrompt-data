Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required logic to round the non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0, following the specifications outlined in the problem description.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Check for multiples of 10**: The program first checks if `n` is already a multiple of 10. If `n % 10 == 0`, it prints `n`, which is the correct behavior as per the problem statement.

2. **Rounding Logic**: If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the program calculates either the largest multiple of 10 less than `n` or the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n` based on the value of `n % 10`:
   - If `n % 10 <= 5`, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 using `n - n % 10`. This correctly rounds `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0.
   - If `n % 10 > 5`, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 using `n + (10 - n % 10)`. This also satisfies the rounding requirement as stated in the problem.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `n = 0` (which is a valid input) and when `n` is at its maximum limit (`10^9`). In both cases, it correctly returns a value that meets the problem's requirements.

The program does not exhibit any scenarios where it would produce an incorrect output given the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, it aligns perfectly with the expected behavior for all valid inputs.
