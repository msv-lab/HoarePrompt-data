The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer constrained by the condition \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, the function does not return any value as there is no output specified in the provided information. Consequently, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` within the specified range, but it does not return a value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\) but does not return any value.**
