To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We need to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) after exactly one swap.
2. The current positions of the minimum and maximum elements are found using `index`.
3. The program calculates the potential distances after considering swaps with both ends of the array (index 0 and index n-1).

### Code Analysis:
- The program finds the positions of `1` and `n` correctly.
- It computes the distance to the start and end of the list for both `1` and `n`.
- The maximum distance is determined by finding the largest of those four distances.

### Potential Issues:
However, the program may not always correctly calculate the maximum possible distance after one swap:

1. **Example Case**: Consider the input `2 1` (which translates to `[2, 1]`):
   - Here, `min_pos` would be `1` (position of `1`), and `max_pos` would be `0` (position of `2`).
   - The distance from index 0 to index 1 is `1`, which is the only possible distance.
   - The program will output `1`, indicating it believes that the maximum distance is `1`.
   - However, it is not accounting for the fact that after the swap, the positions of `1` and `2` will be `0` and `1`, which is not the maximum possible distance of `1`.

### Additional Thoughts:
The code fails to explicitly compute the distance based on actual swaps. It simply considers the extreme indices without validating the actual swap scenario (which should yield the largest distance).

### Conclusion:
Since we found a case where the program does not produce the correct output according to the problem statement, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
