The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (ranging from 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers 1 and n to both ends of the list (index 0 and index n-1) and prints this maximum distance. The function does not include any handling for invalid input cases or checks beyond the initial assumptions about the input.
