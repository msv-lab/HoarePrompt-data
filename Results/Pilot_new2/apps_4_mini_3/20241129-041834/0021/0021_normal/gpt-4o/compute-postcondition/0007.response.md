The code assigns the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)` to `dist4`. The variables `n` and `min_pos` are already defined in the initial state. Since `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in list `a`, `dist4` will calculate the absolute distance from the last index of the list (which is `n - 1`) to the position of `1`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the change in `dist4` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n]; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.**
