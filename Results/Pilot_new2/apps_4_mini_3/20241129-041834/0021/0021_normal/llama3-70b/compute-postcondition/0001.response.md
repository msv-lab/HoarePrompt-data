`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate strings. The input will be a series of integers. The value of `n` indicates that there are at least 2 integers and at most 100 integers provided as input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from input.**
