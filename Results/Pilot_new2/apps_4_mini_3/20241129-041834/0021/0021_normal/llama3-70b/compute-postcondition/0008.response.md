Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a`, where `n` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and computes two distances based on the positions of the integers 1 and `n` within the list. It calculates the maximum distance between these positions and prints the greater value between `max_dist` and the difference of `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not handle any invalid input cases, such as the input not being a valid permutation or being out of the specified range. **
