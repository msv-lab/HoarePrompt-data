The variable `min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. The values of `pos1` and `posn` determine the first occurrences of `1` and `n` in the list `a`, respectively. The calculation depends on these positions and the value of `n`, which is constrained between 2 and 100.

After evaluating the conditions:

- If `pos1` and `posn` are equal, then `abs(pos1 - posn)` is 0, making `min_dist` equal to `min(-1, n - 2)`, which results in `min_dist` being `n - 2` (since `n - 2` will always be greater than -1 for n ≥ 2).
- If `pos1` and `posn` are different, `min_dist` will take the value of `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2).

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
