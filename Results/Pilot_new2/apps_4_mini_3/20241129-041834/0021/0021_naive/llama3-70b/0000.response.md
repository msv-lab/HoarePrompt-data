To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nicholas needs to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap.

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)  # Position of the minimum element (1)
posn = a.index(n)  # Position of the maximum element (n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)  # Not clear why n - 2 is used
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)  # Not clear why n - 2 is used
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))  # Final output
```

### Key Points:
1. The program finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements.
2. It computes `max_dist` and `min_dist` but the logic seems flawed because it involves `n - 2` which does not directly relate to the distance maximization.
3. The output is calculated based on these distances, but does not seem to guarantee that the swap will actually achieve the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum.

### Edge Cases:
1. For a permutation of size 2:
   - Input: `2, 1` should yield a distance of `1` after swapping.
   - Input: `1, 2` should yield a distance of `1` after swapping.
   - The code will not handle these cases correctly because the logic does not account for achieving the maximum distance of `1`.

2. Consider the input array where `1` and `n` are already at the two ends of the array, such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
   - The output should be `4`, but the calculation might not yield that correctly since the existing distance is already maximized.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the program does not correctly ensure the maximum distance is calculated after exactly one swap. The presence of flawed calculations involving `n - 2` raises suspicion about correctness.

**Correctness: **False**.**

The program has not accurately implemented the logic needed to guarantee the correct maximum distance after a swap, particularly for edge cases and smaller inputs. A more straightforward approach would involve checking the possible maximum distances directly after a swap rather than relying on derived calculations.
