To determine if the provided program correctly implements the problem description, let's analyze its logic and reasoning.

### Problem Description:
The task is to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of integers from 1 to n by performing exactly one swap.

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
min_pos = a.index(1)
max_pos = a.index(n)
dist1 = abs(0 - max_pos)
dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)
dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)
dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)
max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)
print(max_distance)
```

### Step-by-step Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the size of the permutation `n` and the permutation itself `a`.
2. **Finding Positions**: It finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements.
3. **Calculating Distances**:
   - `dist1`: The distance if the maximum is swapped with the first element (index 0).
   - `dist2`: The distance if the maximum is swapped with the last element (index n-1).
   - `dist3`: The distance if the minimum is swapped with the first element (index 0).
   - `dist4`: The distance if the minimum is swapped with the last element (index n-1).
4. **Finding Maximum Distance**: It calculates the maximum of the four distances.

### Missing Logic:
The program calculates distances based on swapping with the ends of the array but does not consider the actual impact of the swap on the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. The distances calculated do not consider whether the swaps actually separate the minimum and maximum elements more effectively.

#### Example Case Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
4
2 1 3 4
```
- Here, the minimum (1) is at index 1 and the maximum (4) is at index 3.
- The direct calculation yields:
  - `dist1` = abs(0 - 3) = 3 (if max is swapped with first)
  - `dist2` = abs(3 - 3) = 0 (if max is swapped with last, no swap occurs)
  - `dist3` = abs(0 - 1) = 1 (if min is swapped with first)
  - `dist4` = abs(3 - 1) = 2 (if min is swapped with last)

However, the best swap would be to swap 1 and 4 which gives a maximum distance of 3 (positions 0 and 3). The program doesn't correctly reflect this logic and fails to ensure that the swap produces the best separation between the minimum and maximum elements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, as it does not accurately compute the maximum distance resulting from one swap. It fails for inputs like the one demonstrated above.
