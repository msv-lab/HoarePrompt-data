To verify the correctness of the provided function, we need to closely examine the logic and check if it adheres to the problem description for all potential edge cases.

The function `func_1(n, k)` works as follows:
1. It calculates `multiplier` as `10 ** k`, which gives the smallest positive integer that ends with at least `k` zeros.
2. It computes the value of `x` as `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. This calculation effectively finds the least common multiple of `n` and `10 ** k`.

### Analysis:
- **When k = 0**: The output should simply be `n`, since any number is divisible by itself and has no trailing zeros requirement. The function correctly returns `n` in this case because `multiplier` becomes `1`.
  
- **When k â‰¥ 1**: The function computes the least common multiple (LCM) using the formula `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`, which ensures that the resulting value is the smallest multiple of `n` that also meets the trailing zero requirement.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Large values of n**: When `n` approaches the upper limit of `10^9` and `k` is maximized at `8`, the calculation of `multiplier` would result in `100000000` and the function should still perform correctly as it uses integer arithmetic.
2. **Cases with n being a power of 10**: For instance, if `n = 1000` and `k = 3`, the function should return `1000` since it already has three zeros. The program handles this correctly by finding the LCM.

### Example Cases:
- **Input**: `375 4` => Output: `30000` (Correct)
- **Input**: `10000 1` => Output: `10000` (Correct)
- **Input**: `38101 0` => Output: `38101` (Correct)
- **Input**: `123456789 8` => Output: `12345678900000000` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning and analysis, the function handles the problem requirements and edge cases effectively. There are no identified cases where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
