The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns the product of `n` and the quotient of `10` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `10`. This effectively scales `n` by a factor that adjusts for any common factors with `10`, which is useful for ensuring that the result is a multiple of `10` based on the value of `k`. The function does not handle cases where `k` is outside the specified range, but it does assume valid input as stated in the preconditions.
