The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state indicates that `n` is `n + 1`, we can express the new value of `n` as follows: if `n` starts as `n + 1`, we denote the value of `n` before the increment as `x`, leading to `n = x + 1`. After executing `n += 1`, the new value of `n` becomes `x + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `x + 2`. Thus, the output state reflects this updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is `n + 2`**
