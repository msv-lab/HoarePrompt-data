The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` must not be a multiple of 10, the increment will result in a value that is also not a multiple of 10, maintaining that condition. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `n + 1` (where `n` is not a multiple of 10), `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, `x` is equal to 10.

Output State: **`n` is `n + 1` (where `n` is not a multiple of 10), `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, `x` is equal to 10**.
