The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). The function processes these parameters and returns an output based on their values. However, the specific output or return value for different combinations of `n` and `k` has not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, with specified constraints on their values, and it returns a value based on those parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a non-negative integer k, with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.**
