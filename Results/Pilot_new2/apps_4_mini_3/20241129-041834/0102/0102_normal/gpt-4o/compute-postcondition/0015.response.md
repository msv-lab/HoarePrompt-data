The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. The function can return different outputs based on the value of `n`:

- Case_1: If `n` is between 0 and 9 (inclusive), the function returns the word corresponding to the integer `n` from the list `ones`.
  
- Case_2: If `n` is between 11 and 19 (inclusive), the function returns the word corresponding to the integer `n` from the `teens` list, specifically `teens[n - 10]`.

- Case_3: If `n` is a multiple of 10 and ranges from 10 to 99 (inclusive), the function returns the string corresponding to the tens place of the integer `n`.

- Case_4: If `n` is not covered by the previous cases, the function returns the string representation of the integer `n` in the format of "tens" followed by a hyphen and "ones", where `tens[n // 10]` gives the tens place name and `ones[n % 10]` gives the ones place name for the integer `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return its English word representation based on its range and value, covering different scenarios for numbers 0 to 99. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns the word representation of n based on its value: corresponding word from ones for 0-9, teens for 11-19, tens for multiples of 10 from 10-99, or a combination of tens and ones for other values between 10 and 99.**
