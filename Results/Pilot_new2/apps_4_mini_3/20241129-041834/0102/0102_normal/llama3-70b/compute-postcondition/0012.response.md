Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, the output is the string representation of `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the output is the corresponding word from the `teens` list. Otherwise, if `s` is 20 or greater, the output is the string representation of `s`, composed using the appropriate elements from the `tens` and `ones` lists.***
