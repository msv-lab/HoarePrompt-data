The function accepts an integer input `s` in the range of 0 to 99 and prints its English word representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For values 20 and above, it constructs the word representation by combining elements from the `tens` and `ones` lists, using a hyphen if necessary. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
