Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. It converts an integer score from the range 0 to 99 into its English word representation. Here's how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Handling Input Range**: The input `s` is guaranteed to be an integer within the specified range (0 ≤ s ≤ 99). The program reads this input correctly.

2. **Handling Numbers 0-9**: For numbers less than 10, the program accesses the `ones` list to get the correct English representation. This aligns with the problem description.

3. **Handling Numbers 10-19**: For numbers between 10 and 19, the program correctly accesses the `teens` list to handle these specific cases, which is also required by the problem.

4. **Handling Numbers 20-99**: For numbers starting from 20 up to 99, the program constructs the output using the `tens` list for the tens place and the `ones` list for the units place, correctly formatting the strings with a hyphen where necessary. The condition `(s % 10 == 0)` ensures that no unnecessary hyphen is added when there is no units digit.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result directly, matching the requirement to produce a single string output consisting only of English lowercase letters and hyphens, without spaces.

The implementation covers all edge cases as described in the problem, from 0 to 99, and formats the output correctly without any errors. Thus, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description accurately.
