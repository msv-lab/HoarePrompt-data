Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts integer scores from 0 to 99 into their corresponding English words as specified in the problem description. 

Here's the breakdown of how it handles various cases:

1. **Scores from 0 to 9**: The program utilizes the `ones` list, which contains the words for each digit from 0 to 9. It directly accesses the word based on the score.

2. **Scores from 10 to 19**: The program uses the `teens` list to convert numbers in this range to their appropriate words. It correctly adjusts the index by subtracting 10.

3. **Scores from 20 to 99**: For scores 20 and above, the program calculates the tens place using integer division (`s // 10`) to get the corresponding word from the `tens` list. If there is a non-zero ones place (i.e., `s % 10` is not zero), it appends the corresponding word from the `ones` list prefixed by a hyphen.

The program handles all potential cases within the specified range (0 to 99) correctly:

- For an input of `0`, it outputs `''`, which is the correct representation.
- For `6`, it outputs `six`.
- For `10`, it outputs `ten`.
- For `15`, it outputs `fifteen`.
- For `20`, it outputs `twenty`.
- For `99`, it outputs `ninety-nine`.

Since all specified input cases from 0 to 99 are handled accurately and the output meets the problem requirements, the program is confirmed to be correct.
