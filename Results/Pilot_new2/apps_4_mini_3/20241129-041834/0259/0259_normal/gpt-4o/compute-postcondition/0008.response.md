The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `n`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and the conditions regarding `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference (t - s_i) is divisible by `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0**.
