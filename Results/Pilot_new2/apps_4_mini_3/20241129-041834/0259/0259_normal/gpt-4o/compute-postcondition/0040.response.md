Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` representing the time Serval arrives at the station, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, where each tuple contains two positive integers that define the arrival time and interval of each bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for all the bus routes based on their schedules and returns the index of the route with the smallest wait time. If `n` is 0 (though the provided constraints indicate `1 <= n`), it would return -1 since there are no bus routes to consider. The function does not explicitly handle the situation where `bus_routes` is empty, which could lead to an unexpected behavior if `n` is valid but the list is empty. Thus, the expected outcome is that it returns the 1-indexed bus route with the shortest wait, or -1 if no valid bus routes exist.**
