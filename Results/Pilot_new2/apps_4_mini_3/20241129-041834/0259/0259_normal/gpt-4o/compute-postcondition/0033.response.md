Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100); `i` is 2; `s_i` is the third element of `bus_routes[2]`; `d_i` is the fourth element of `bus_routes[2]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. Otherwise, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0 and `min_wait_time` potentially remains unchanged. If not, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
