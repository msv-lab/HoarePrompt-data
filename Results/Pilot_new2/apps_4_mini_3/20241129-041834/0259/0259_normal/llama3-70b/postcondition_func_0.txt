The function accepts input for the number of bus routes `n` and a time `t`, then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the start time `s` and the duration `d` for each bus route. It calculates the minimum time until the next bus departure from time `t` for all bus routes and returns the 1-based index of the bus with the minimum time. If no buses are available (though the code guarantees at least one bus route), it would return -1. The function does not return any value but prints the bus index.
