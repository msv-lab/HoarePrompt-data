`buses` is updated to include a new tuple containing the values of `s` and `d`. Since `buses` was initially an empty list, it now contains one tuple `(s, d)`. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged, as does the nature of `buses`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` now contains one tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.**
