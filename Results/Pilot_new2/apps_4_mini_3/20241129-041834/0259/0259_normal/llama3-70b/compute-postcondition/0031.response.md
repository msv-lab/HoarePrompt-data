Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `min_time` is the minimum time from all buses calculated as `(t - s) % d` for each bus where `time` was less than the previous `min_time`; `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus corresponding to the minimum time; `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`; and the result of `print(ans)` is the value of `ans` which depends on the execution of the loop that calculates `min_time` and `ans`.**
