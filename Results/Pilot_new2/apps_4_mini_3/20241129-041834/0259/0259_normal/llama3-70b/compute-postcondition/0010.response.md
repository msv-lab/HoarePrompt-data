The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` already contains tuples, and `s` and `d` are integers obtained from user input. Therefore, the state of `buses` will change to include the new tuple.

Since `s` and `d` are obtained from user input, their specific values are not known. However, we can indicate that they are integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` now includes the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(s, d)`, where `s` and `d` are integers obtained from user input.**
