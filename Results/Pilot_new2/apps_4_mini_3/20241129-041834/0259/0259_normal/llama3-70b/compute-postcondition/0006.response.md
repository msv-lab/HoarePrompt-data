The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from the output of `input()` after being converted from strings to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state indicates that `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)` but does not specify the previous values of `s` and `d`. The other variables, `n` and `t`, remain unchanged in this context. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments of `s` and `d`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are input integers.**
