According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition defined in the `range` function. The loop executes for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has a value that is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

Given that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, we know `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, the loop will not execute again.

To adjust the states at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The maximum divisor condition does not need to change since it is updated only under specific conditions within the loop body.

Thus, if `gcd` allows for another iteration, we need to make sure that the new value of `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, if `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is either equal to `gcd // i` or remains its previous value, and `i` is increased by 1**
