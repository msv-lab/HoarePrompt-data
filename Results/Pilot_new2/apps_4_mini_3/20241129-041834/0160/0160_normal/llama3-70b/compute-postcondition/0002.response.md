The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `A`, which is `A[0]`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is equal to the first input integer between 2 and 500, `K` is equal to the second input integer which is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers populated by input values, and `gcd` is equal to `A[0]`.

Output State: **`N` is equal to the first input integer between 2 and 500, `K` is equal to the second input integer which is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers populated by input values, `gcd` is equal to `A[0]**.
