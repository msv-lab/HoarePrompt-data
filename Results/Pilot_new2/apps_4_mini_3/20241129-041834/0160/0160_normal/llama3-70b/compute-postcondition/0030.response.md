The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. Here, `N` is an integer that must be between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer that can be as large as 10^9, and `A` is a list containing `N` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^6. The specifics of the output have not been provided in your request. Therefore, based on the given constraints, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (between 2 and 500), a non-negative integer K (up to 10^9), and a list A of N integers (each between 1 and 10^6).**
