The statement `max_divisor = max(max_divisor, i)` updates the value of `max_divisor` to be the greater of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `max_divisor` is initially equal to `gcd`, after the execution of the code, `max_divisor` will either remain equal to `gcd` or be updated to the value of `i`, depending on whether `i` is greater than `gcd`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either equal to `gcd` or `i` (whichever is greater), and `gcd` is divisible by `i`.**
