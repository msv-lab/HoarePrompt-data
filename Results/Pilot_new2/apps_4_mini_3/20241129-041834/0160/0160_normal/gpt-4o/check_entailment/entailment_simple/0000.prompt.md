You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
8 20

-----Sample Output-----
7

7 will divide every element of A if, for example, we perform the following operation:
 - Choose i = 2, j = 1. A becomes (7, 21).
We cannot reach the situation where 8 or greater integer divides every element of A.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing two integers N and K followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N, where 2 <= N <= 500, 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for each i, and 0 <= K <= 10^9.
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list containing at least 2 integers; `gcd_result` is the greatest common divisor of all integers in `lst` starting from the second integer, `N` must be greater than or equal to 1; `num` is the last integer in the list.
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns gcd_result, which is the greatest common divisor of all integers in lst starting from the second integer

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the subsequent elements are a list of N integers A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^6).
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `divisors` is a set containing all unique divisors of `N`, where `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500).
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of the unique divisors of N in descending order, where N is a positive integer between 2 and 500.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
