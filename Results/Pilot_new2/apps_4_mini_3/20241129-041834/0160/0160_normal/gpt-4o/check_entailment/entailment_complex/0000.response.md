To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description, following the constraints and expected behavior.

### Problem Description Recap
We are given a sequence of N integers. We can perform operations to adjust these integers by selecting two distinct indices and adding 1 to one integer while subtracting 1 from another. The goal is to find the maximum positive integer that divides every element of the array after performing up to K such operations.

### Review of the Functions

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function computes the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a list of integers.
   - The function iterates through the list starting from the second integer, calculating the cumulative GCD.
   - **Issue**: It doesn't account for the operations that can modify the integers. The problem states we can perform operations to potentially change the list of integers, but this function simply returns the GCD of the original list. It fails to consider how the operations could lead to a different maximum positive divisor.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calculates the divisors of an integer `N`, which corresponds to the first element of the input tuple.
   - This function does not consider the sequence of integers nor the operations allowed. The problem requires the maximum divisor of the modified integer list, yet this function solely focuses on the divisors of `N` itself, which is irrelevant to the task.

### Issues Identified
- **Inadequate Handling of Operations**: The code does not incorporate any logic for performing the allowed operations (adding 1 to one integer while subtracting 1 from another), which is crucial for solving the problem as described. It fails to analyze how the maximum divisor can change based on these operations.
- **Incorrect Input Handling**: The second function does not utilize K or the subsequent integers from the input correctly. The entire logic is not relevant to the problem's requirements, as it misinterprets the input structure.

### Conclusion
Given these shortcomings:
- The code does not handle the operations correctly.
- It fails to compute the maximum integer that divides the modified list after performing operations.

Since there are clear cases where the program does not work as expected (for example, when K is large enough to adjust all elements significantly), the correctness of the code is compromised.

Thus, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **False**
