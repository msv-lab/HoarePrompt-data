To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we first analyze the loop declaration and the provided state.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):`. This means the loop variable `i` will take values starting from 1 up to and including `int(math.sqrt(x))`.
2. The provided state indicates that `x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer \( N \) (where \( 2 \leq N \leq 500 \)). 
3. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since this is the first iteration, `divisors` includes 1 and \( N \).

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the maximum value that `i` can take in the loop, which is equal to \( int(math.sqrt(x)) \). Given that we want the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

- If `i` is currently 1, then for the loop to execute again, it must be that \( 1 < int(math.sqrt(N)) \). Thus, \( int(math.sqrt(N)) \) must be at least 2, which means \( N \) must be at least 4 (since the smallest integer whose square root is at least 2 is 4).
- After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.

Now we summarize the adjusted states based on this analysis:

State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (4 <= N <= 500); if `i` is 1, `divisors` is now a set containing the values 1 and N. Now, `i` is 2 and the loop must execute for `i` up to `int(math.sqrt(N))` which must be at least 2.**
