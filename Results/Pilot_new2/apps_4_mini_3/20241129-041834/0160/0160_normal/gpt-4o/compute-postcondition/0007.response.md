The variable `i` is currently 2, and it is being added to the set `divisors`. Given that `N` is a positive integer between 4 and 500, the set `divisors` will now include the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged and still hold their initial conditions.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (4 <= N <= 500); `i` is 2; `divisors` is now a set containing the values 1, N, and 2.**
