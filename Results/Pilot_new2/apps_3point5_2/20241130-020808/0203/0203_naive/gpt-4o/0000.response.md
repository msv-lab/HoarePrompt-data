Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly simulates the voting process by maintaining queues for depublicans and remocrats. It alternates between removing the top of each queue and then moving the index of the loser to the end of the queue by adding n. This process continues until there is only one faction left in the queue, which determines the outcome of the vote. The code handles all possible cases described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
