According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the votes string. If there are more characters in the string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string. If v equals 'D', d_queue contains 0, r_queue is empty, i is the index of the last character processed. If v is not equal to 'D', d_queue is empty, r_queue has one element with the value 0, i is the index of the last character processed. So for the loop to execute one more time, the string votes should have more characters, and i should be incremented by 1.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string with more characters, i is the index of the next character to be processed**
