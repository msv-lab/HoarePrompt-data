Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It creates two queues, one for 'D' employees and one for 'R' employees. Then, it simulates the voting process by continuously comparing the indices of the next 'D' and 'R' employees to vote. If the 'D' employee's index is less than the 'R' employee's index, the 'D' employee's index is added to the 'D' queue with n added to it. Otherwise, the 'R' employee's index is added to the 'R' queue with n added to it. This process continues until one of the queues is empty, and then the program prints the outcome of the vote based on which queue is not empty. 

The program correctly implements the voting process described in the problem description and outputs the correct result for any given input.
