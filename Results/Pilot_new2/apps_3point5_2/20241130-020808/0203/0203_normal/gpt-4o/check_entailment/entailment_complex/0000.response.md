Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It simulates the process of employees making statements and denying others the right to vote until there is only one employee left. The program keeps track of the employees' factions and ensures that the correct faction wins the vote in the end. By using two queues to represent the 'D' and 'R' employees, the program accurately models the voting process described in the problem. Thus, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
