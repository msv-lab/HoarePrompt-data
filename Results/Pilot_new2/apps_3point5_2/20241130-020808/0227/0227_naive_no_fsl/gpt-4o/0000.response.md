Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to consider all possible combinations of variables b_i to perform the sequence of operations. Additionally, the code provided is incomplete and missing necessary imports. 

An example where the program fails is for the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The expected output is -1, as it is not possible to perform the described sequence of operations. However, the program will output 2 which is incorrect.

Overall, the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, hence it is incorrect.
