Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, `assigned` is not empty and contains the element `a[n-1]`, `m` is 3, `i` is n-1, `x` is `a[n-1]`, `can_form` is True if a[n-1] - x is in assigned. Otherwise, no change in the variables. The current state is that `can_form` is False***
