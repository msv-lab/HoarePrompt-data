Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned contains the last element of list a, m is 1, i is 1, can_form is True, and x is the last element of list a. If not can_form, then n is still a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned contains the last element of list a, m is 2, i is 1, can_form is False, and x is the last element of list a.***
