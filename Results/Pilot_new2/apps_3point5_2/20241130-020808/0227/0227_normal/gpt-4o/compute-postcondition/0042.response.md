Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 3, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `can_form` is False. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
