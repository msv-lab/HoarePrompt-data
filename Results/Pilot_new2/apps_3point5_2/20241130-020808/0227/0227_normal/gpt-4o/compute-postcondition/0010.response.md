Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of list `a`. If a[i] - x is in assigned, then can_form is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
