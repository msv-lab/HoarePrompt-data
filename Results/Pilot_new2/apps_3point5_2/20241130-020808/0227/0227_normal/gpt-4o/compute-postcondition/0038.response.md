Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, `assigned` still has elements left, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `can_form` is True. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
