Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, assigned is not empty, m is 2, i is 2, x is the last element of list a, can_form is True. The value of i is 2. The current value of x is the last element of list a. The current value of m is 2. The current value of assigned is not empty. The current value of can_form is True. The current value of n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23). The current value of a is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added. The current value of (a[i] - x in assigned) is True. We break out of the current loop or if statement.***
