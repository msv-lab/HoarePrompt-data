Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly finds the minimum number of variables m required to perform the described sequence of operations. The program sorts the input sequence and iterates through each element, checking if the difference between the current element and any previously assigned value is already present in the assigned set. If not, it increments the variable m, indicating the need for an additional variable.

The program ensures that each element in the input sequence can be composed from the assigned values using addition operations, as required by the problem description. It correctly computes the minimum number of variables m needed to perform the sequence of operations.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
