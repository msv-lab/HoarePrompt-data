Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, `m` is 5. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index `i-1`, the function will leave the values of `n`, `a`, and `m` unchanged.***
