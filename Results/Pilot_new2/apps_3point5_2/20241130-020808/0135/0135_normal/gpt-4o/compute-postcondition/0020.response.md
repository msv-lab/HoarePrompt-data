Output State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` ≤ `k` along with the new remainder value after adding the new remainder to the set. If at any point during the loop execution, a remainder is found to be already present in `seen_remainders`, the loop will terminate and return 'No'.
