Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` < `n`. `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` ≤ `k` along with the new remainder value. If remainder is in `seen_remainders`, the program returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
