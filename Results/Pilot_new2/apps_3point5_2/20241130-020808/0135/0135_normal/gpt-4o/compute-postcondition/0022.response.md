The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program may return different strings based on various conditions:

Case 1: The program returns the string 'No'.
Case 2: The program returns 'No' since the remainder calculated from `n` modulo `i` is not in the `seen_remainders` set currently.
Case 3: The program returns the string 'No'.
Case 4: The program returns the string 'No'.
Case 5: The program returns 'Yes' if the loop completes without finding a duplicate remainder in 'seen_remainders', otherwise it returns 'No'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and based on certain conditions, it may return different strings ('Yes' or 'No').
