According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `k`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` < `n`. The set `seen_remainders` contains the remainder of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` ≤ `k` along with the new remainder value after adding the new remainder to the set. If the new remainder is already in `seen_remainders`, the program returns the string 'No'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the new remainder value after adding `k + 1` to `seen_remainders` must not already be in `seen_remainders`.
State: **`n`, `k + 1` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k + 1` ≤ 10^18 and `k + 1` < `n`. `seen_remainders` contains the remainder of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` ≤ `k + 1` along with the new remainder value after adding the new remainder to the set and the new remainder value is not already in `seen_remainders`.**
