Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`. The current value of `i` is 1. If the remainder is in `seen_remainders`, then the program state remains the same as the precondition, with the condition that the remainder is in `seen_remainders`.***
