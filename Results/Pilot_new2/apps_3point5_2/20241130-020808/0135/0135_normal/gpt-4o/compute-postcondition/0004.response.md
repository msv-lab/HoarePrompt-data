According to the code, the loop can execute if the range provided (1, k + 1) is valid. Since k is less than n, 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, the loop will execute if k is a valid integer within the given range.

State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n; seen_remainders is an empty set, i is 1**
