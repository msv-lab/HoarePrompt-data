Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if all the remainders of division of `n` by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. It uses a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders seen so far, and if it encounters a duplicate remainder, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, if all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'. This matches the problem description provided.
