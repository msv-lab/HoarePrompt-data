Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It checks if all remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. It uses a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders seen so far, and if it finds a duplicate remainder, it returns 'No'. If no duplicates are found, it returns 'Yes'. The annotation also correctly describes the logic and functionality of the program. The missing edge case of handling `k` equal to 1 is also mentioned in the annotations.
