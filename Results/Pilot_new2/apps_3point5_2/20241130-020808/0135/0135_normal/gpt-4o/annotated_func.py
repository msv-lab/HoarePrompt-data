    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is less than `n`; `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` ≤ `k` along with the new remainder value after adding the new remainder to the set. If at any point during the loop execution, a remainder is found to be already present in `seen_remainders`, the loop will terminate and return 'No'.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes' if the loop completes without finding a duplicate remainder in 'seen_remainders', otherwise it returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is found to be a duplicate within the set `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If no duplicates are found, the function returns 'Yes'. However, there seems to be a missing edge case in the annotations where if `k` is equal to 1, the function should return 'Yes' without entering the loop to avoid division by zero.
