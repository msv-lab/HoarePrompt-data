Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes input values n and k, then iterates over integers from 1 to k and calculates the remainder of dividing n by i. It keeps track of these remainders in a set called `seen`. If at any point during the loop, a remainder is found in the `seen` set, it prints "No" and exits the program. If no duplicate remainders are found, it prints "Yes" at the end.

This approach ensures that the program checks for distinct remainders as required by the problem description.
