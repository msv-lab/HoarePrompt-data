The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function lacks a clear return value and seems to be incomplete as it does not explicitly return any value.
