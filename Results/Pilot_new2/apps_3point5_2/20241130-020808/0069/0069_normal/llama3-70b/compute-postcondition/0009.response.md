Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x` are integers; `s` is assigned the input string; `cnt0`, `cnt1` are the counts of '0' and '1' in `s' respectively; `balance` is equal to `cnt0` - `cnt1` and not equal to `x`. After the if condition, the current value of `balance` is different from `x` and the condition ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0) is true.***
