Postcondition: ***`T` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer input; `x` is an integer input; `s` is assigned the input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s'; `balance` is equal to `cnt0` - `cnt1`. If the balance is equal to `x`, then the program variables remain in their initial state with the specified values.***
