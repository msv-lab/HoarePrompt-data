Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `x` are integers; `s` is a string; `cnt0`, `cnt1` are the counts of '0' and '1' in `s' respectively; `balance` is equal to `cnt0` - `cnt1` and not equal to `x`. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), then the current value of `balance` is different from `x`. Otherwise, the value printed is ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1), where balance is `cnt0` - `cnt1`.***
