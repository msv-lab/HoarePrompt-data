Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `x` are integers; `s` is a string; `cnt0`, `cnt1` are the counts of '0' and '1' in `s' respectively; `balance` is equal to `cnt0` - `cnt1`. If balance is equal to x, then n is incremented by 1. If balance is not equal to x and ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), then balance remains the same as cnt0 - cnt1. Otherwise, the new value of balance is calculated as ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1).***
