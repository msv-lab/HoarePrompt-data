Output State: **`T` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance == x`, then the value of `n + 1` is printed. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed.**
