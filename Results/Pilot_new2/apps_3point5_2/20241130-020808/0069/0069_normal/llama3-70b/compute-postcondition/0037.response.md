Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input, then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads integers `n` and `x`, as well as a string `s`. It calculates the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, determines the balance as the difference between the counts, and based on the balance and `x`, it prints either `n + 1`, -1, or a calculated expression. The function does not accept any parameters and only takes input from the user to perform its calculations.**
