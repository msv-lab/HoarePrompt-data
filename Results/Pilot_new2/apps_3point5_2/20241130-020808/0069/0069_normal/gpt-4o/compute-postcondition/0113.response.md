According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `results` list must have at least 1 element, each element in the `results` list will represent the count of conditions met for each iteration. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least 2 elements with updated counts for the conditions met.
State: **`result` list must have at least 2 elements, each element in the `results` list will represent the count of conditions met for each iteration, and the value of the `result` list is printed**
