Postcondition: ***prefix_balances is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values, i is equal to n, n is greater than or equal to 0, each element in prefix_balances is the sum of the previous element and 1 if the corresponding element in string s is '0', otherwise it subtracts 1 from the previous element, balance is not equal to 0, count is 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), the current value of x, b, balance, and count satisfy the condition where (x - b) % balance is 0 and (x - b) // balance is greater than or equal to 0.***
