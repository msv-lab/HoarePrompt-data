According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is the total number of elements in prefix_balances list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. 
State: **prefix_balances is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values, `i` is 2, `n` is the total number of elements in prefix_balances list**
