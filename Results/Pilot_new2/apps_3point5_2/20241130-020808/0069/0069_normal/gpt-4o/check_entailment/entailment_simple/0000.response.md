Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input correctly, calculates the balance of the given string, and then calculates the prefix balances. It then counts the number of prefixes with a balance equal to x and prints the result. The program correctly handles the case where there are an infinite number of prefixes by outputting -1.

The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for each test case.
