Correctness: **True**

The provided program follows the problem description accurately. It reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string for each test case. It then calculates the number of prefixes with the desired balance as specified in the problem description. The program correctly handles the cases where the number of prefixes can be infinite and outputs the correct results for each test case. The implementation matches the requirements of the problem description.
