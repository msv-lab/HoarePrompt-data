The function `func_1` reads input data that contains information about a certain number of test cases. For each test case, it processes the values of `n`, `x`, and `s` based on the provided constraints. It calculates certain conditions based on the input data and stores the count of how many times these conditions are met for each test case in a results list. Finally, it prints out each count stored in the results list. The function does not explicitly return any value but outputs the calculated counts for each test case.
