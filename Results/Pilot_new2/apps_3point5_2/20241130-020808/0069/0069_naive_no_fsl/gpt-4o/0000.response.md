Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x. There are several issues in the code:
1. The check for an infinite number of prefixes is incorrect. The program checks if the desired balance $x$ is in the list of prefix balances, which is not a correct condition to determine if there are infinite prefixes.
2. The count of prefixes with the desired balance is not calculated correctly. The loop that iterates over prefix balances and checks if the balance can be achieved by adjusting the prefix balance is not accurate.
3. The code does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 1
101
```
The correct output should be 0, as there are no prefixes with balance 1 in the infinite string. However, the provided code will output 1, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
