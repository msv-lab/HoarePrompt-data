Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes the input correctly and processes each test case as described in the problem statement.
- It calculates the balance of the string correctly and then computes the prefix balances.
- It handles the case where the balance is 0 separately, checking if the desired balance "x" exists in the prefix balances array.
- For other cases where the balance is not 0, it correctly counts the number of prefixes that satisfy the given conditions.
- The output is also formatted as required, printing the number of prefixes or -1 if there is an infinite number of prefixes.
- The program logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases provided in the problem statement.
