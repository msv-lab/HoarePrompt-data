Output State: **n, m, k, a, b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. a and b are distinct numbers. block_a is the block number of location a, floor_a is the floor number of location a. block_b is the block number of location b, floor_b is the floor number of location b. If floor_a == 1, time_to_exit is 0. Otherwise, time_to_exit is equal to 10 + (floor_a - 1). direct_walk_time is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15.**
