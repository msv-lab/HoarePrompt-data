The function `func_1` accepts five parameters `n, m, k, a, b`, where `n, m, k, a, and b` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. Additionally, `a` and `b` are distinct numbers. 

After executing the function body, the program returns the total time taken to move from location `a` to location `b`, considering all the given conditions and calculations. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n, m, k, a, b` meeting the specified constraints and return the total time taken to move from location `a` to location `b`.
