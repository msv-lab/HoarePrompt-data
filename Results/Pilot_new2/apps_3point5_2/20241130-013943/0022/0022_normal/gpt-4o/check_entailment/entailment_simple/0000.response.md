Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given string is "s-palindrome" as described in the problem description. It checks if the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in the string `s` are equal for all `i` up to the middle of the string. If they are all equal, the function returns True, indicating that the string is "s-palindrome". If any pair of characters are not equal, it returns False.

This implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description and will correctly identify whether a given string is "s-palindrome" or not.
