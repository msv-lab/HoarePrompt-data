Postcondition: ***`s` is a palindrome string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_palindrome` becomes False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
