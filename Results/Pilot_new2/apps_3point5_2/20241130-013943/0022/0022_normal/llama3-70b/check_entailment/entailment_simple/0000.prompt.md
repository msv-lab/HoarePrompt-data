You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

 [Image] English alphabet 

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition
**s is a string of length at least 1 and at most 1000, consisting of only English letters.**
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    is_spalindrome = True
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - i - 1]:
            is_spalindrome = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `s` is a palindrome string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is True. If `s[i] != s[n - i - 1]` for any i in the range of n//2, then `is_spalindrome` is False.
    print('TAK' if is_spalindrome else 'NIE')

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
