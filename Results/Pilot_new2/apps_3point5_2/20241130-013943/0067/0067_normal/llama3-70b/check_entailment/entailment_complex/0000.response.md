Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, `z` from the input and then determines the result based on the relationships between these values. It handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and outputs the correct result in each case.

Additionally, the program accounts for the uncertainty in the result when there are multiple possible outcomes due to the unknown votes of the `z` persons. It correctly prints '?' in such cases.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
