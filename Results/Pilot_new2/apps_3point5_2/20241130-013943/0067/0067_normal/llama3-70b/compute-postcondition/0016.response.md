Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x < y, then the current value of x is less than y. If x == y and z == 0, then x is equal to y and y is equal to x. If z is not equal to 0 and x == y, x, y, z remain unchanged. If x is not equal to y, x, y, z remain unchanged.***
