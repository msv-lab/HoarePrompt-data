Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. x, y, z are assigned the values obtained from input split into integers. x is less than or equal to y + z. x is greater than or equal to y. The current values of x, y, z satisfy the condition x == y. If z == 0, then x is equal to y and y is equal to x. If z is not equal to 0, then x, y, z remain unchanged.***
