Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from input and compares them based on specific conditions. If max_upvotes is less than min_downvotes, it prints '-', if max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, it prints '+', otherwise it prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and always operates on the input integers x, y, and z.**
