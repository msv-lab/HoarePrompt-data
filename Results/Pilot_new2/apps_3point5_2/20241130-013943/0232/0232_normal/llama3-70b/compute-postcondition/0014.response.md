Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors list contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} and is not empty with at least one more color to iterate through; counts list is populated with integers obtained from splitting the input; color_counts dictionary is updated with the count of the specific color incremented by 1. If color is not in color_counts, then color_counts[color] is 1. The value of color_counts[color] is 0.**
