Output State: **`found` remains True, `window_counts` contains counts of each color equal to their corresponding targets, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is the total number of colors, `color` is now equal to the last color in the list `colors`, `window_counts[color]` is now incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
