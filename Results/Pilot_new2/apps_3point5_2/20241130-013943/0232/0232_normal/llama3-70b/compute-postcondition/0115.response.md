Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` list still contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} and is not empty, `counts` list is still populated with integers obtained from splitting the input, `color_counts` dictionary still contains the count of each color in colors, `found` remains True if all counts in `window_counts` after sorting match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `window_counts` dictionary includes the count of each color as a key with the corresponding value for the last iteration of the loop.**
