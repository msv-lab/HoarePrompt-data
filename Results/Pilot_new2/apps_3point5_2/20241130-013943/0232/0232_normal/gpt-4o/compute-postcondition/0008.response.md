Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`} to the values specified in the list `k`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values initialized to 0; `left` is 0, `right` is in the range of 0 to `n-1`; `current_counts[colors[right]]` has been incremented by 1 and at least one color has count less than its desired count. There exists at least one color such that current_counts[color] is not equal to desired_counts[color]***
