According to the code, the loop will execute again only if there is at least one color for which the `current_counts[color]` is not yet equal to `desired_counts[color`. At the end of the last iteration, the condition is not satisfied, and at least one color has a count less than its desired count. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that there exists at least one color such that `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]`.

State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`} to the values specified in the list `k`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values initialized to 0; `left` is decreased by 1 to the previous value increased by 1; `right` is in the range of 0 to `n-1`; `current_counts[colors[right]]` has been incremented by 1 and at least one color has count less than its desired count. There exists at least one color such that `current_counts[color]` is not equal to `desired_counts[color`. At least one color has count less than its desired count**
