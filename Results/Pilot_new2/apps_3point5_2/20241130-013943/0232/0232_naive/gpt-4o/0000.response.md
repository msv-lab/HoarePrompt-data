Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists. It uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the count of each color of lightsabers and checks if the current window satisfies the desired counts. The program iterates over the colors and checks if all the desired counts have been met within a contiguous interval. If so, it returns 'YES', otherwise it continues to slide the window until it finds a valid interval or reaches the end. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
