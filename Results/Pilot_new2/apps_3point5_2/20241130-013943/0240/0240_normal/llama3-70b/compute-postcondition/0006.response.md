According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the set `t_set`. If there are still characters left in the string `s` that are in the set `t_set`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is not empty, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string containing the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are present in `t_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in `s` needs to be checked. If `c` is in the set `t_set`, then it should be included in the string `n`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
State: **`s` is not empty, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string containing the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are present in `t_set`, `c` represents the next character in `s`. If the current character `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` will contain that character.**
