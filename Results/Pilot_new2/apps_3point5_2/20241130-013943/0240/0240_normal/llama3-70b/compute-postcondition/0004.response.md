Output State: `s` is not empty, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` contains the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are present in `t_set`, `c` represents each character in `s`. If the current character `c` is in the set `t_set`, then the program enters the if condition.
