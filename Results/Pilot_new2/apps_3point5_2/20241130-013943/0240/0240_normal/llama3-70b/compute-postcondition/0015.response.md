The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`. Both `s` and `t` are strings. The function returns the integer value of the concatenation of all characters in string `s` that are present in the unique elements of string `t`, followed by the string `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, and return the integer value of concatenated characters from `s` that are unique in `t`, followed by `t`.
