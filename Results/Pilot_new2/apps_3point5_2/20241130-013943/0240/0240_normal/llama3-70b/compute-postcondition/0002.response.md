According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in string `s`. Since `s` is a string, it will have characters, so the loop will definitely execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, and `n` is an empty string. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `s` is not empty, and `c` represents each character in `s`.

State: **`s` is not empty, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` represents each character in `s`**
