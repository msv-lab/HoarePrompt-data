Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints state that the function `func_1` should create a new string `n` by concatenating all characters from `s` that are present in the unique elements of `t`, followed by the whole string `t`. However, the code does not handle the case where the substring `t` has repeated characters, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `t = '63'`, the code will only append one '6' and one '3' from `s`, and then append the whole `t` resulting in '3063' instead of '3036366999'.
