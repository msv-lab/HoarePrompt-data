Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` represents the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string obtained by joining the first permutation of `chars`. If the current `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with `sub`, then the `candidate` has been yielded.***
