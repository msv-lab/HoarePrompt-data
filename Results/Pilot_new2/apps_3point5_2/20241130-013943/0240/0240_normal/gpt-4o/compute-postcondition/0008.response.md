Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` represents the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string obtained by joining the next permutation of `chars` where `candidate` is equal to ''.join(perm), and the next permutation of `chars` is yielded. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the program continues execution according to the condition.***
