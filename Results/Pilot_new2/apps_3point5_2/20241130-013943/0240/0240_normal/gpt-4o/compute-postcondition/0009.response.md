According to the code, the loop can execute again depending on the permutations of the `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` represents the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string obtained by joining the next permutation of `chars` where `candidate` is equal to ''.join(perm).

To execute the loop one more time:
- The next permutation of `chars` should be yielded.
- The `candidate` obtained from the next permutation should be a valid number with respect to `sub`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` represents the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string obtained by joining the next permutation of `chars` where `candidate` is equal to ''.join(perm), and the next permutation of `chars` is yielded and `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`**.
