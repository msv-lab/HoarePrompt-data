According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `chars` string is not empty. In this case, since `chars` is a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, the loop will execute. The loop will iterate over permutations of the characters in `chars`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the `perm` variable represents the first permutation of `chars`.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty sequence of arbitrary digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` represents the first permutation of `chars`**
