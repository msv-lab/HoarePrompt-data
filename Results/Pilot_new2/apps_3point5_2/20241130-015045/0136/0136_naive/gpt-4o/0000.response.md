Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two very long integers a and b as strings from input and removes leading zeroes.
2. It compares the length of a and b, if one is longer, it prints the corresponding symbol (< or >).
3. If the lengths are equal, it compares the actual integer values of a and b. 
4. The program correctly handles cases where a < b, a > b, and a = b, as demonstrated in the provided examples.
5. There are no missing edge cases or logic errors in the code that would lead to incorrect output.
