Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two very long integers a and b without any issues.
2. The program correctly removes leading zeroes from both a and b using the lstrip('0') method.
3. It then compares a and b as strings and correctly prints "<", ">", or "=" based on the comparison.
4. The program accounts for all possible cases mentioned in the problem description, including cases where a is less than b, a is greater than b, and a is equal to b.
5. The logic of the program is sound and covers all potential cases, making it correct.
