Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, `data` is a list containing the input values, `b` is the value of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed. If `a` evaluates to False (a string '0'), then the current value of `a` becomes False. If `b` is 0, then the value of `a` remains unchanged. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. The length of `a` is not greater than the length of `b`. If the condition (a < b) is true, then the current value of `a` is less than `b` and the code prints '<'. If the condition (a >= b) is true, then the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
