The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It performs a specific calculation using pre-defined non-negative integer values `a` and `b`, both with no more than 10^6 digits. The function then returns the result of this calculation. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to perform a calculation using non-negative integers `a` and `b` with no more than 10^6 digits and return the result.
