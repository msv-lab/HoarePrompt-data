Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and strips leading zeroes from both. It then compares `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal. If they are not equal, it prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The code effectively handles the input of two very long integers and correctly determines which number is greater or if they are equal. The comparison logic is implemented as per the problem description and the code works for all potential cases. The output hints indeed align with the logic implemented in the code. The program is correct for all valid inputs.
