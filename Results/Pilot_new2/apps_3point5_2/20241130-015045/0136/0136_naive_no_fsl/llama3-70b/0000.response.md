Correctness: True

The provided program correctly compares two very long integers a and b by removing any leading zeroes and then comparing them. It follows the problem description by printing "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b. The program handles cases where a, b have leading zeroes and very large input sizes, making it a correct solution.
