Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the minimum sum that can be achieved with k numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than n, in which case it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, it calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It then calculates the remainder left after constructing the base sequence of k numbers.
5. The program constructs the sequence by multiplying each number in the base sequence by d and then distributing the remainder to each number in decreasing order.
6. Finally, the program prints the resulting sequence if it is valid, or -1 otherwise.
7. The logic provided in the program correctly follows the problem description and ensures that a valid sequence with maximum greatest common divisor is generated.
