Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is necessary for finding the optimal solution for the given problem. The program then uses the calculated greatest common divisor to create a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers that sum up to `n` and have the maximal greatest common divisor.

Since the program follows the problem description and uses the necessary steps to find the optimal solution, it can be considered correct.
