Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. It then creates a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor is maximal. If such a sequence exists, it outputs the sequence. If not, it outputs -1.
- The code ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing by starting with 1 and incrementing the numbers. It checks if the sum of the numbers in the sequence equals `n`, and if so, prints the sequence. If not, it prints -1.
- The code handles cases where `n` is less than `k` by directly outputting -1.
- The code correctly outputs any valid sequence that meets the conditions in the problem description.

Since the code aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases, the correctness is determined to be True.
