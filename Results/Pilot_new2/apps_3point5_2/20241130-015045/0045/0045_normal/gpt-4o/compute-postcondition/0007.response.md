According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10
- `min_sum` is assigned the value of k * (k + 1) // 2 and min_sum is less than or equal to n
- `d` is assigned the value n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)
- `remainder` is assigned the value n - d * min_sum
- `sequence` is a list containing elements d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd
- `i` is set to k - 1

State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, min_sum is assigned the value of k * (k + 1) // 2 and is less than or equal to n, d is assigned the value n // (k * (k + 1) // 2), remainder is assigned the value n - d * min_sum, sequence is a list containing elements d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, i is k - 1**
