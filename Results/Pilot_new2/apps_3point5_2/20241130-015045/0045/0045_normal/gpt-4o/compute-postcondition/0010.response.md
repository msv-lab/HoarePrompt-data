Postcondition: ***n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, min_sum is assigned the value of k * (k + 1) // 2 and is less than or equal to n, d is assigned the value n // (k * (k + 1) // 2), remainder is assigned the value n - d * min_sum, sequence is a list containing elements d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, i is k - 1. If remainder is 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
