According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are all integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s_i` and `b_i` are integers indicating the price of shares such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list containing integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in descending order, `shares` is assigned the value 0, `i` is 0**
