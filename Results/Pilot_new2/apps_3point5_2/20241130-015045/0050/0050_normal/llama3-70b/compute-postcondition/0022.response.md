Postcondition: ***n is between 2 and 30, m, r are all integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, s_i and b_i are integers indicating the price of shares such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000, s is a list containing integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, b is a list containing integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in descending order. If r >= s[i], then shares is updated to the sum of the integer division of r by s[i] and the integer division of r by s[i+2]. Additionally, r is updated to the remainder of the division of r by s[i]. If r < s[i], the loop or if statement is exited.***
