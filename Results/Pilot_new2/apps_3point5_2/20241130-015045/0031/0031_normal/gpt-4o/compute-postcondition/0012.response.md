Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is equal to the result of `(total_days - (i + 1)) % MOD`, `denominator` is equal to `total_days` % MOD, `i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ i < k, `k` must be greater than `i + 1, `numerator` is equal to `(numerator * (total_days - i)) % MOD`**
