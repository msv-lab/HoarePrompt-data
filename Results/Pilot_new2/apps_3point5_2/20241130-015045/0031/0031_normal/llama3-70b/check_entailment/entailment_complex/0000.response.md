Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The annotated program `func_1` correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in Udayland with 2^n days in a year. The program first calculates the total number of days, then iterates through k people to calculate the numerator and denominator as described in the problem description. It then finds the gcd of the numerator and denominator, divides both by the gcd, and returns the remainders of the division by (10^6 + 3) as required.

The program always follows the problem description and provides the correct output for any valid input values of n and k. Therefore, it is correct.
