Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland for the given values of n and k. It calculates the probability using the formula and then reduces the fraction to its simplest form by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd). Finally, it takes the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 as required and returns the values A and B. The program handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
