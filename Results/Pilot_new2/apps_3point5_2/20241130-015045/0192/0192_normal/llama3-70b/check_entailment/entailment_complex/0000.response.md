Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y and prints it, which is not the correct solution to the problem.

The correct solution to the problem involves finding the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting from the equilateral triangle of side length x, by modifying the length of a single side of the current triangle. This requires a different approach than what the provided program is doing.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
