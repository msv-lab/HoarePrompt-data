According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cubes`. If `cubes` contains at least 1 list, the loop can execute. Since `n` is a positive integer and `cubes` is a 2D list containing n lists of integers, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` being an empty set does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a 2D list containing n lists of integers, `digits` is an empty set**
