#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3. cubes is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes (0 <= a_{i}_{j} <= 9).**
def func_1(n, cubes):
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]
    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of n lists, cube_faces is a list of n sets, x is increased by 3 from its original value
    return x
    #The program returns x increased by 3 from its original value
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and cubes. n is an integer between 1 and 3, while cubes is a list of n lists containing integers representing numbers on the faces of cubes. The function iterates through the cubes to create sets of unique faces. It then increments x by 3 until a condition defined in can_form_number function is met. The function returns the final value of x increased by 3.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer greater than 0.**
def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))
    used_cubes = [False] * n
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: At the end of the loop execution, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the last digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True if at least one cube was found for the corresponding digit in `digits`, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `digits` and checked for each cube face in `cube_faces`. Additionally, `found` remains False
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_form_number` accepts an integer `num` greater than 0. It iterates through the digits of `num`, checks if each digit can be formed using available cube faces, and updates the status of used cubes. If a cube face is found for each digit, the function returns True. If any digit cannot be formed with the available cube faces, the function returns False. The functionality does not cover cases where the input `num` is not a positive integer or where there are missing cube faces for certain digits.
