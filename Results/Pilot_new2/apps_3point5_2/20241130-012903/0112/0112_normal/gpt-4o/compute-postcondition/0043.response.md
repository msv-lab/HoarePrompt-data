Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True if `digit` is in any of the `cube_faces` lists, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `digits` and checked for each cube face in `cube_faces`. If `found` is False after the loop execution, then `found` remains False.***
