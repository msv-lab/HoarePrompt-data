According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `digits` has at least 1 element. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `digits` must have at least 1 element, and the variable `digit` should be the first digit in the list. At the start of the loop, the list `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to False. So, for the loop to execute, the list `used_cubes` must have the same number of elements as the list `digits`, and all elements in `used_cubes` should be set to False.
State: **num is an integer greater than 0, digits is a list containing the digits of num with at least 1 element, used_cubes is a list of n elements all set to False, digit is the first digit in the list digits**
