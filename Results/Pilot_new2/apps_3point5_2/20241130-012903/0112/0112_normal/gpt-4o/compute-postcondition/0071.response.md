Functionality: **The function `can_form_number` accepts an integer `num` greater than 0. It iterates through the digits of `num`, checks if each digit can be formed using available cube faces, and updates the status of used cubes. If a cube face is found for each digit, the function returns True. If any digit cannot be formed with the available cube faces, the function returns False. The functionality does not cover cases where the input `num` is not a positive integer or where there are missing cube faces for certain digits.**
