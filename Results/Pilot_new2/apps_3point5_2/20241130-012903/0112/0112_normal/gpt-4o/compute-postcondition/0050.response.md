Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is False, `i` is 0. The current state now is that `used_cubes[i]` is True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
