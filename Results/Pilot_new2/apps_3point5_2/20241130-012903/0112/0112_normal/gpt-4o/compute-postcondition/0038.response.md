Output State: `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is adjusted to i+1, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, the current value of `used_cubes[i+1]` is False, `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i+1]`, and the loop can execute one more time.
`used_cubes[i]` is set to True.
