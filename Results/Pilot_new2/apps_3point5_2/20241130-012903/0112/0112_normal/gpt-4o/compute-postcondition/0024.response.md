According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more digits left in the `digits` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is greater than 0, `digits` contains the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` has n elements, `digit` is the last digit in the list `digits`, `found` is False, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `digits`. To execute the loop one more time, the loop needs to move on to the next digit in the list `digits`.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True if at least one cube was found for the corresponding digit in `digits`, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `digits` and checked for each cube face in `cube_faces`**
