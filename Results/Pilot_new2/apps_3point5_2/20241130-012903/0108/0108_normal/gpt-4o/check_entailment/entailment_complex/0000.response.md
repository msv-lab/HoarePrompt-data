Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string `s` and iterates through it to find the characters of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the same order. If all characters are found in `s`, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If not, it prints -1, as required by the problem description. The program also handles the case where the string `s` is empty, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description but is a valid case. Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all cases.
