Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of target, `i` must be less than the length of `s` + 2, `j` has either been incremented by 1 or remained the same based on the condition `s[i] == target[j` after the execution of the if else block. The variable `j` has been incremented by 1 if `s[i]` equals `target[j]`.***
