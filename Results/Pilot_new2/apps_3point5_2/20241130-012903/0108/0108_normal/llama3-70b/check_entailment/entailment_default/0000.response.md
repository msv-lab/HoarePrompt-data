Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads a string consisting of only lowercase English letters, iterates over the alphabet, and appends each character in order by replacing occurrences of that character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet. After processing all characters in the alphabet, if the result string contains all 26 letters, it is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed. The code handles all edge cases and accurately fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
