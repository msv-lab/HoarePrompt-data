Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used given the constraint that for each lemon, there should be 2 apples and 4 pears. It then calculates the total quantity of fruits that can be used in the compote. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases as it correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. The output hints also align with the code's functionality. Therefore, the code is correct.
