Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote based on the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. It then computes the total number of fruits by summing the appropriate multiples of lemons, apples, and pears. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits, which aligns with the desired output as specified in the problem description. 

Additionally, the output hints correctly summarize the code's functionality without introducing any misleading information. Hence, there are no discrepancies between the code, problem description, and output hints, leading to the conclusion that the code is correct for all cases.
