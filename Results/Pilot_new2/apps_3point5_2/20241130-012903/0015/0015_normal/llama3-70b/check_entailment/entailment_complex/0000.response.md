Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if `c` divides the difference between `b` and `a` evenly and if the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES'. If either condition is not met, it prints 'NO'.

The program handles all cases mentioned in the problem description and gives the correct output for each case. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
