Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If c == 0 and a equals b, then c remains 0. If c == 0 and a is not equal to b, the program prints 'NO' and the values of a, b, and c remain the same as before. If c is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0), then a, b, and c remain unchanged. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.***
