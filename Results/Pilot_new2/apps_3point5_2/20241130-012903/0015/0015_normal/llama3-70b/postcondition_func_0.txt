The function `func` reads three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c` from input. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if `c` divides the difference between `b` and `a` evenly and if the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES'. If either condition is not met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value, it only prints the corresponding result based on the conditions.
