Correctness: **True**

The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It compares `b` and `a`, if they are equal, it prints 'YES'. If `b` and `a` are not equal, it checks if `c` is 0, in which case it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The logic covers all scenarios mentioned in the problem description and the examples given.
