Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It checks if the favorite number b appears in the sequence generated based on the given conditions. It handles the cases where b is equal to the first element of the sequence, where c is equal to 0, and where (b - a) is a multiple of c and positive. 

Therefore, the program outputs "YES" if b appears in the sequence and "NO" otherwise, as specified in the problem description.
