You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya likes everything infinite. Now he is studying the properties of a sequence s, such that its first element is equal to a (s_1 = a), and the difference between any two neighbouring elements is equal to c (s_{i} - s_{i} - 1 = c). In particular, Vasya wonders if his favourite integer b appears in this sequence, that is, there exists a positive integer i, such that s_{i} = b. Of course, you are the person he asks for a help.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contain three integers a, b and c ( - 10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) — the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number and the difference between any two neighbouring elements of the sequence, respectively.


-----Output-----

If b appears in the sequence s print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
1 7 3

Output
YES

Input
10 10 0

Output
YES

Input
1 -4 5

Output
NO

Input
0 60 50

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the sequence starts from integers 1, 4, 7, so 7 is its element.

In the second sample, the favorite integer of Vasya is equal to the first element of the sequence.

In the third sample all elements of the sequence are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.

In the fourth sample, the sequence starts from 0, 50, 100, and all the following elements are greater than Vasya's favorite integer.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.**
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (b == a) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        if (c == 0) :
            print('NO')
        else :
            if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) :
                print('YES')
            else :
                print('NO')
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *a, b, c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. b is not equal to a. c is not equal to 0. If (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, 'YES' is printed. If either (b - a) % c != 0 or (b - a) / c < 0, 'NO' is printed.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *a, b, c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. b is not equal to a. If c == 0, 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to 0, if (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, 'YES' is printed. If either (b - a) % c != 0 or (b - a) / c < 0, 'NO' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *a, b, c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If b == a, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to a, if c == 0, 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to 0, if (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, 'YES' is printed. If either (b - a) % c != 0 or (b - a) / c < 0, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three integers a, b, and c as input. It compares b and a, if they are equal, it prints 'YES'. If b and a are not equal, it checks if c is 0, in which case it prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, it verifies if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
