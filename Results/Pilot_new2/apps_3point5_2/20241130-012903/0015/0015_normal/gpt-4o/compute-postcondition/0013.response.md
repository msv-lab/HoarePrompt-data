Postcondition: ***a, b, c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If b == a, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to a, if c == 0, 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to 0, if (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, 'YES' is printed. If either (b - a) % c != 0 or (b - a) / c < 0, 'NO' is printed.***
