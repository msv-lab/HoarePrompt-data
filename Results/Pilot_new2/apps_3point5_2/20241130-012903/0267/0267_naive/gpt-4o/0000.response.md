Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions: func_1 checks if a number contains at most k different digits, and func_2 calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that meet the criteria specified in func_1. The program then reads input, calls func_2, and prints the result. 
The logic in func_1 correctly checks if a number contains at most k different digits by converting the number to a string, converting the string to a set to get unique digits, and comparing the length of the set to k. 
The logic in func_2 iterates through all numbers from l to r, checks if each number meets the criteria using func_1, and sums up the valid numbers while taking the modulo operation. 
Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and the logic is correct, the correctness is True.
