Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines a function `func_1` to check if a number has at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string and checking the length of the set of digits.
2. The program correctly iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive), calculates the sum of numbers that satisfy the condition in `func_1`, and computes the result modulo `998244353`.
3. The program correctly takes input, calls the `func_2` function, and prints the result. 
4. The program logic matches the problem description for all potential cases, including the example cases provided in the description.
