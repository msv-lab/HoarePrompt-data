Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of numbers that meet the given conditions. The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement to count the numbers with at most k different digits within the range from l to r. The function uses memoization to optimize the calculation and returns the result modulo 998244353, as required. The input is correctly read and passed to the function, and the output is printed as expected. Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct results for all potential cases.
