According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range from l to r is not empty. So, for the loop to execute, the range from l to r must have at least one number. At the start of the loop, total_sum is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the range from l to r needs to contain at least one number, and num is equal to l.
State: **l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, total_sum is 0, num is equal to l, range from l to r must have at least one number**
