Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the count of unique digits in a number is less than or equal to `k`. However, the function `func_2` only sums the numbers in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition of `func_1`, but it does not take into account the condition of having at most `k` different digits.

For example, if we consider `l = 1`, `r = 2`, and `k = 1`, the correct output should be `1` since both `1` and `2` have only one unique digit. However, the current implementation will return `3` as the sum of `1` and `2` without considering the restriction of at most one different digit.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
