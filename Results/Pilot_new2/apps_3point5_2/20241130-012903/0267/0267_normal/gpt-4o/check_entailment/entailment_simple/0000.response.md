Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions. The first function `func_1` checks if the count of unique digits in the string representation of the number `n` is less than or equal to `k`. The second function `func_2` iterates over the range from `l` to `r` and calculates the sum of numbers where each number satisfies the condition specified in `func_1`.

The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
