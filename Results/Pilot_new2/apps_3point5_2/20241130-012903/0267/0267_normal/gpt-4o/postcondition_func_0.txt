The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number to be evaluated and `k` represents the maximum number of unique digits allowed in `n`. The function returns True if the count of unique digits in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns False. The code accurately checks if the count of unique digits is within the specified limit. However, potential edge cases or missing functionalities could include handling non-integer inputs or scenarios where `n` is negative, which are not addressed in the current implementation.
