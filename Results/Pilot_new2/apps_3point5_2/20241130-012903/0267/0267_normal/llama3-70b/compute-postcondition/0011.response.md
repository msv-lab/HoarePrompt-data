The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)). The initial state remains the same, with `n`, `k`, and `dp` unchanged, and `i` is 1. The pair (n, k) is not present in the dp dictionary.
Output State: **The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))**
