According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the pair (n, k) should not be present in the dp dictionary. Hence, the states need to be adjusted to `n`, `k`, and `dp` remain the same, `i` is 1, and the pair (n, k) is not present in dp dictionary.
State: **`n`, `k`, and `dp` remain the same, `i` is 1, and the pair (n, k) is not present in dp dictionary**
