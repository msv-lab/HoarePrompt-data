Output State: N is an integer greater than or equal to 4, K is an integer greater than or equal to 0, A_i are positive integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, N and K are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces, A is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, gcd is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the previous gcd and all elements in the list A. After executing the code, gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of the previous gcd and the new element A[i].
