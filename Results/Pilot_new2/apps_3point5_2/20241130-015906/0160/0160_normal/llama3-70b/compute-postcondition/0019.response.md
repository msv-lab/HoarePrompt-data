Output State: **`N`, `K`, `A_i` are positive integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i. `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces. `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list A. The square root of `gcd` is at least 1. `i` is updated to the next divisor of `gcd` after the current `i`. After the if else block executes, the value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, which is equal to the maximum of the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.
`max_divisor = max(max_divisor, i)`**
