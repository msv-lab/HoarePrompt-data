Output State: **`A` is a list of N integers, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, each element of `A` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `divisors` now includes all the previous divisors of x and the new divisors obtained by dividing x by each element i in the set, and one additional divisor obtained by dividing x by the next value of `i`, and `divisors` has now added the value of `i+1` to its set. `divisors` has added the value of `i+1` to its set.**
