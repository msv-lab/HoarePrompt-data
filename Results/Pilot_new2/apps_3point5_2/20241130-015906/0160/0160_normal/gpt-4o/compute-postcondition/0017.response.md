Functionality: The function `func_2` takes a parameter `x`, which is a list of N integers (2 <= N <= 500) where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6. It also accepts an integer `K` (0 <= K <= 10^9). The function computes all the divisors of `x` and returns them in a sorted list in reverse order.

Note: The code correctly computes the divisors of `x` and returns them in reverse order as specified in the annotations. The edge cases of negative numbers for `x` or `K` are not explicitly handled in the annotations or code.
