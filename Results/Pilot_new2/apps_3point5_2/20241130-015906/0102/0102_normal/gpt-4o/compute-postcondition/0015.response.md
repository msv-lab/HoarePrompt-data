The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99. After executing the function body, the function returns different strings based on the value of `n` according to the following cases:
- Case 1: If n is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representing the integer value of n in the list 'ones'.
- Case 2: If n is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string from the 'teens' list at index n-10.
- Case 3: If n is between 10 and 99 inclusive and n % 10 equals 0, the function returns the string from the 'tens' list at the index n//10.
- Case 4: If n is between 10 and 99 inclusive and n % 10 does not equal 0, the function returns the combination of the string in the 'tens' list at index n // 10 and the string in the 'ones' list at index n % 10, separated by a hyphen '-'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` between 0 and 99, and return different strings based on the value of `n` according to the specified cases.
