Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the k-rounding of a positive integer n as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters, `n` and `k`, and calculates the positive integer x by multiplying n with a value derived from `k` and `n`. This approach ensures that the output x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n. 

The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output for each case. The provided examples also demonstrate that the code works correctly for various inputs. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, we can confidently say that the code is correct.
