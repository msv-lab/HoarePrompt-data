#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.**
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns the positive integer x, which is equal to n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer with a range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer with a range of 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The function calculates the positive integer x by multiplying n with a value derived from `k` and `n`, and returns this value.
