Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the arrival times and intervals for each bus route.
- The `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route based on the time Serval goes to the station and whether the bus route has passed or the waiting time between buses.
- The program correctly determines the chosen route based on the minimum wait time calculated for each bus route.
- The program handles multiple buses arriving at the same time by choosing any of them as valid answers.
- The program outputs the correct bus route that Serval will use based on the given inputs.
