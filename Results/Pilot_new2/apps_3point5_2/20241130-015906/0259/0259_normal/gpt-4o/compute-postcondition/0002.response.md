According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity, so it does not affect the loop execution. The variables `t`, `bus_routes`, and `chosen_route` are not involved in the loop execution. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `n` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0.
State: **`min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
