Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is equal to 0, `s_i` is equal to the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, `s_i` is less than `t`. If ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0), then `wait_time` is set to 0. If ((t - s_i) % d_i != 0), then `wait_time` is assigned the value `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
