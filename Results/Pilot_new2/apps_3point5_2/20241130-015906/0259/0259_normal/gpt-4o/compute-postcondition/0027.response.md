According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time` are updated based on the conditions in the if else block. For the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be increased by 1. 
State: *`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i` is increased by 1, `s_i`, `d_i` remain the same, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the new `i`.
