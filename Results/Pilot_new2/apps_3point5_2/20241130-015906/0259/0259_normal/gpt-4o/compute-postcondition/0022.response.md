Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time` are updated. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, `min_wait_time` is updated, `chosen_route` is updated if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `i` is increased by 1, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the `bus_routes` list at index `i`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the `bus_routes` list at index `i`, `wait_time` is set to 0. If the condition is false, `min_wait_time` is updated, `chosen_route` is updated if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `i` is increased by 1, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the `bus_routes` list at index `i`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the `bus_routes` list at index `i`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
