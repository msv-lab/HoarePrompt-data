Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input for the number of bus routes and a specific time, then reads the arrival times and intervals for each bus route.
- It calculates the time until the next bus arrives based on the input time and bus schedules.
- The code then prints the index of the bus route with the shortest waiting time.
- The output produced by the code aligns with the problem description and covers all possible cases based on the constraints provided.
- The code correctly determines the bus route that Serval will use according to the given conditions.
