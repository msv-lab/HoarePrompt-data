According to the code, the loop can execute `n` times based on the condition. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `buses` list contains bus routes with arrival time `s_i` and interval `d_i` for each route, and a new bus route with arrival time `s` and interval `d` is added to the `buses` list. For the loop to execute one more time, a new bus route with arrival time `s` and interval `d` should also be added to the `buses` list.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `buses` list contains bus routes with arrival time `s_i` and interval `d_i` for each route including the new bus route with arrival time `s` and interval `d`, `s` is assigned the next integer from input, `d` is assigned the next integer from input**
