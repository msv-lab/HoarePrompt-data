According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `buses` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1, and we need to update the state to include the values of `s_i` and `d_i` for each bus route added to the `buses` list.
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `buses` list should contain bus routes with arrival time `s_i` and interval `d_i` for each route**
