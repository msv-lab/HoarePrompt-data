Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements in the array by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements and then calculating the distance between them. It considers all possible scenarios by comparing the distances from the minimum element to the ends of the array and from the maximum element to the ends of the array. The maximum distance is then computed and printed, which satisfies the requirements of the problem description. The logic implemented in the program covers all potential cases, making it correct.
