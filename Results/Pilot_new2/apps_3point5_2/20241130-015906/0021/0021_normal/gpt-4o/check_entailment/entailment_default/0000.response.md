Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the distance between the minimum and maximum elements in the permutation array but does not perform exactly one swap to maximize this distance. The output hints are consistent with this analysis. For example, in the case of `6 5 4 3 2 1`, the maximum distance should be 5, but the code does not handle this scenario correctly.
