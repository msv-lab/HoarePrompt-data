Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, then determines the distance of these elements from the beginning and end of the array. It then calculates the maximum distance achievable by swapping one element and outputs this value, which is the correct answer according to the problem description. The program works for all potential cases as it always calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap.
