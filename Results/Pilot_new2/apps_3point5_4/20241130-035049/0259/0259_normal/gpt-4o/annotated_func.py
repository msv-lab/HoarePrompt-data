#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route.**
def func_1(n, t, bus_routes):
    min_wait_time = float('inf')
    chosen_route = -1
    for i in range(n):
        s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]
        
        if s_i >= t:
            wait_time = s_i - t
        elif (t - s_i) % d_i == 0:
            wait_time = 0
        else:
            wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
        
        if wait_time < min_wait_time:
            min_wait_time = wait_time
            chosen_route = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All variables `n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i, s_i, d_i` are positive integers. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is 0, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After all iterations, `min_wait_time` will be the minimum wait time among all routes, and `chosen_route` will be the route with the minimum wait time.
    return chosen_route
    #The program returns the route with the minimum wait time among all routes
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: n, t, and bus_routes. It iterates through the bus_routes to calculate the minimum wait time for each route based on the arrival time and interval. Then, it returns the route number with the minimum wait time among all routes. If there are multiple routes with the same minimum wait time, it returns the route that appears first in the list.
