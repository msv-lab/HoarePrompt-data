Postcondition: *n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the first positive integer from the first tuple in bus_routes, d_i is the second positive integer from the first tuple in bus_routes. Also, s_i is less than t. Additionally, ((t - s_i) % d_i != 0)***
