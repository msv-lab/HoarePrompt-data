According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `n` is a positive integer. Additionally, since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, the loop will execute for each bus route represented in the `bus_routes` list. 

To ensure the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0 (to represent the first iteration of the loop)**
