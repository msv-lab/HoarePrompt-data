Output State: **All variables `n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i+2, s_(i+2), d_(i+2)` are positive integers. If the wait time is less than the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 2`. `s_i` is assigned the value of `s_i` of the `i-th` bus route, and `d_i` is assigned the value of `d_i` of the `i-th` bus route.**
