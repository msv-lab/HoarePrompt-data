The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of bus routes), `t` (a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station), and `bus_routes` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route). After executing the function body, the program returns the route with the minimum wait time among all routes. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of bus routes, and then return the route with the minimum wait time. 
Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n, t, and bus_routes. It returns the route with the minimum wait time among all routes.**
