Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input correctly and stores the bus arrival times and intervals in a list of tuples.
- It then calculates the minimum time difference between `t` and each bus arrival time, taking into account the intervals between buses.
- Finally, it prints the index of the bus with the minimum time difference, which corresponds to the bus that Serval will use.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output based on the given examples.
