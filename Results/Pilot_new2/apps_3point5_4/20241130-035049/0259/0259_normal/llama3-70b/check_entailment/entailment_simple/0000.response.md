Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input correctly and stores the bus routes in a list of tuples. Then, it iterates over each bus route to calculate the time Serval needs to wait in order to catch a bus for that route, based on the current time ($t$) and the arrival time of the first bus of that route ($s_i$) and the interval between buses of that route ($d_i$). 

The program correctly determines which bus route Serval will use by finding the minimum waiting time among all routes and then prints the index of that route plus one as the output. This aligns with the problem description, where Serval will choose the bus that requires him to wait the least amount of time. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
