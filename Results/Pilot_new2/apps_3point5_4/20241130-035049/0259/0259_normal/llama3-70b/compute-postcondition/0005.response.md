According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the counter `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. So for the loop to execute one more time, the counter `_` should be incremented by 1 and `n` should still be within the range of 1 to 100.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is a list that contains at least one element with the tuple (s, d), where `s` is the first integer from the input, and `d` is the second integer from the input.**
