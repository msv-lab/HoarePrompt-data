According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should still be within the valid range, so it should remain unchanged. The tuple `(s, d)` has been appended to the `buses` list, so the `buses` list now contains at least two elements. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is a list that contains at least two elements with the tuple `(s, d)`**
