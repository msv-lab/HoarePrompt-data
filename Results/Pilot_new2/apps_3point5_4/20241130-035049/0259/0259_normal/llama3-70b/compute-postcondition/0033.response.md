Functionality: **The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `t`, then reads `n` pairs of positive integers representing bus arrival times and intervals. It calculates the minimum time difference between `t` and bus arrival times, and prints the index of the bus with the minimum time difference. The function does not have a specific return value.**
