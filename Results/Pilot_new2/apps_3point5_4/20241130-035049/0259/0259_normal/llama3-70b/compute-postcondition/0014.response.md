According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `buses` list has at least 1 element. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, it meets the condition for the loop to execute. The loop will iterate through each tuple `(s, d)` in the `buses` list. 

To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is a list that contains at least 1 element with the tuple `(s, d)`, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values from the first tuple in `buses`**
