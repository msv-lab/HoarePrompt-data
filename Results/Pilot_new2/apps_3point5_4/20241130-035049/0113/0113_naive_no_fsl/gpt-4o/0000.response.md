Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program calculates the k-rounding of n correctly by finding the multiplier needed to add the required number of zeros at the end of n such that the resulting number is divisible by n. The math.gcd() function is used to find the greatest common divisor between n and the multiplier. Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for all the given examples.
