According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `x`. If `n % x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is increased by 1. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` should be such that `n % x` is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` must be such that `n % x` is not equal to 0**
