Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements of A and then finds all the divisors of the sum of A. It then iterates over these divisors and checks if each divisor can divide every element of A after the operations. If it can, then it prints the divisor. The program covers all potential cases and the logic seems sound, making it correct.
