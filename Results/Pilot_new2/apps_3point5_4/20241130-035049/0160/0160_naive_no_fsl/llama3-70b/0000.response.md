Correctness: True

Explanation:
The given Python program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, and then iterates through the divisors of the gcd to find the maximum divisor that satisfies the given condition. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
