According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already executed for all values of `i` up to the square root of `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state should be:
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all 1 <= i <= N, x is a perfect square. If x is divisible by i, divisors will be updated to include x divided by i for each i in divisors, i is incremented by 1.**
