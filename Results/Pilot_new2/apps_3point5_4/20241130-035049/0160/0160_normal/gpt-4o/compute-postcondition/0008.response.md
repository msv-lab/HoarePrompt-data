Output State: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing the divisors of x, x is a perfect square. The set divisors is updated to include the integer i and x divided by i for each i in divisors.
