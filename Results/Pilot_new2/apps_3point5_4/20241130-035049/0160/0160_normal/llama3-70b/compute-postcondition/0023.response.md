According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `gcd`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, `gcd` and `max_divisor` are positive integers. If gcd % i == 0 and i * i != gcd, max_divisor is equal to max(max_divisor, gcd // 2). Otherwise, max_divisor is a positive integer equal to max(max_divisor, gcd // (i-1). 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition for the loop to continue. Since the loop increases `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **N is at least 2, gcd and max_divisor are positive integers. If gcd % i == 0 and i * i != gcd, max_divisor is equal to max(max_divisor, gcd // 2). Otherwise, max_divisor is a positive integer equal to max(max_divisor, gcd // (i-1)). `i` needs to be incremented by 1.**
