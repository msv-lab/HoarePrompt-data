Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly finds the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculates the maximum possible distance between them after performing exactly one swap. It considers all possible cases for the positions of the minimum and maximum elements and calculates the distances accordingly. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
