Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and then calculating the distances between these elements and the ends of the array. It then calculates the maximum distance possible and prints it as the output. The logic of finding the minimum and maximum positions and calculating the distances is correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.
