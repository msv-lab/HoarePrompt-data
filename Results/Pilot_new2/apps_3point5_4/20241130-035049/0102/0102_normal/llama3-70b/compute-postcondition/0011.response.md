Postcondition: ***s is an input integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list containing string representations of numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list containing string representations of numbers from ten to nineteen; tens is a list containing string representations of the tens place values. If s is less than 20, the function returns the string representation of the number indexed by `s - 10` in the teens list. If s is larger or equal to 20, the function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens place value of s and the string representation of the ones place value of s if non-zero, separated by a hyphen if the ones place value is non-zero.***
