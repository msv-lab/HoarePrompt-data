Postcondition: ***s is an input integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list containing string representations of numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list containing string representations of numbers from ten to nineteen; tens is a list containing string representations of the tens place values. If s < 10, the function prints the string representation of the number indexed by s in the ones list. If s is between 10 and 19, the function returns the string representation of the number indexed by `s - 10` in the teens list. If s is 20 or greater, the function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens place value of s and the string representation of the ones place value of s if non-zero, separated by a hyphen if the ones place value is non-zero.***
