Output State: **s is an input integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list containing string representations of numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list containing string representations of numbers from ten to nineteen; tens is a list containing string representations of the tens place values. The current value of s is less than 20; the string representation of the number calculated by indexing the teens list at position `s - 10` is returned.**
