Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts an integer score between 0 and 99 to its English equivalent as described in the problem description. It uses three lists to represent the English words for numbers from 0 to 9 ('ones'), numbers from 11 to 19 ('teens'), and multiples of ten from 10 to 90 ('tens'). The program handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and returns the correct English word for the input integer. It concatenates the words with a hyphen where necessary to form the final string representation of the number.
