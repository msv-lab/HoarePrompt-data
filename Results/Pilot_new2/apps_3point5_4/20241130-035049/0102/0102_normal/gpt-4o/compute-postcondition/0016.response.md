Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer parameter `n` in the range 0 to 99 and returns a string representation of that number based on specific cases:
- If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the string representation of `n` from the 'ones' list.
- If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the string value representing that number from the 'teens' list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99 and divisible by 10, it returns the element at index `n // 10` from the 'tens' list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99 but does not fall into the above cases, it returns the string representation of `n` using the 'tens' and 'ones' lists.
The function provides a textual representation of the input number based on these conditions.**
