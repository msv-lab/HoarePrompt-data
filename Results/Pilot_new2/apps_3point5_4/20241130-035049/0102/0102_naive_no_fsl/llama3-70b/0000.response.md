Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly maps the input score to its corresponding English word representation as described in the problem statement. It covers all cases from 0 to 99 and provides the correct output for each case. The logic for handling numbers less than 10, numbers between 10 and 19, and numbers between 20 and 99 is implemented correctly. The program also accounts for cases where the number is divisible by 10 and where it is not, appending a hyphen and the corresponding word for the ones digit. Overall, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description.
