Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly maps the input integer score to its English word representation as described in the problem description. It covers all possible cases for the input score and returns the corresponding English word. The logic is implemented correctly and provides the expected output for all valid inputs within the specified range (0 ≤ s ≤ 99).
