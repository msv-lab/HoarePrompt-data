Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by counting the number of depublicans and remocrats and outputting the result based on which fraction has more members. The program loops through all employees, denying the right to vote to some employees according to their statements, and determines the outcome of the vote based on the remaining eligible voters. The logic implemented in the program ensures that the correct faction wins the vote according to the rules described in the problem.
