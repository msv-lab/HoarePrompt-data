Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It maintains two queues, one for the depublicans and one for the remocrats. It processes the statements of employees one by one and keeps track of the indices of the employees who are no longer allowed to vote. The program then determines the outcome of the vote based on the remaining employees in the queues.

The program considers all possible cases where an employee is denied the right to vote and updates the queues accordingly. It ensures that the process is repeated until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining.

Based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented in the program, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases.
