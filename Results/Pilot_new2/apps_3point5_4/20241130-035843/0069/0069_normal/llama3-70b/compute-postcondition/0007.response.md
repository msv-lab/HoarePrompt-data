Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, `T` is greater than 0, `cnt0` is the number of occurrences of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in string `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0` - `cnt1`, if the balance is equal to `x`, then the current state of the program variables is such that the balance is equal to `x`, `n` is incremented by 1.**
