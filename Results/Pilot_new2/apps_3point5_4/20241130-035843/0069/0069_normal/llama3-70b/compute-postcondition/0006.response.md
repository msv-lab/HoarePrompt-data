Postcondition: ***s is a string of length n, n is an input integer, x is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, T must be greater than 0, cnt0 is the number of occurrences of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the number of occurrences of '1' in string s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1. If the balance is equal to x, then the current state of the program variables is such that the balance is equal to x.***
