Postcondition: ***s is a string of length n, n is an input integer, x is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, T must be greater than 0, cnt0 is the number of occurrences of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the number of occurrences of '1' in string s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then after the execution of the if else block, n is incremented by 1. If balance is not equal to x and (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) != 0, then print((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is executed.***
