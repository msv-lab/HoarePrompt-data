Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the balance of the given string $s$ and determines the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$. It handles the case where there may be an infinite number of such prefixes by checking if the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the current balance can be reached by repeating the string $s$.

The program follows the problem description by considering all possible scenarios and providing the correct output for each test case.
