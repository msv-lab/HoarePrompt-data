Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the integer value at index 8 of the list `data`, `s` is the integer value at index 10 of the list `data`, `balance` is equal to the result of subtracting the count of '1's in `s` from the count of '0's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the differences between the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i - 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is the total number of times the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` are satisfied during the loop execution.**
