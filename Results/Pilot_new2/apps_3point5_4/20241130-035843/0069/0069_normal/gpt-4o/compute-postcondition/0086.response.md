According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1. After running the code, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to be `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. Therefore, for the next iteration:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `x`, `s`, `balance`, `prefix_balances`, `results`, and `T` must be correctly updated. `prefix_balances[i]` will be updated as described.**
