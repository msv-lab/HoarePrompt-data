According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next iteration will have `i` as 2. 
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at index 8 of the list `data`, `s` is assigned the integer value at index 10 of the list `data`, `balance` is equal to the result of subtracting the count of '1's in `s` from the count of '0's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
