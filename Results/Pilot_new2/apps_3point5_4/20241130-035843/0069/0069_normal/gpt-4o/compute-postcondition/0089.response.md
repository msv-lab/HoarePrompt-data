Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `n`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, `prefix_balances`, `results`, and `T` will be correctly updated based on the loop code. The `prefix_balances` list will contain the accumulated sum of 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0' and -1 otherwise. If `balance` is 0, then the current state of the program variables is such that `balance` equals 0.***
