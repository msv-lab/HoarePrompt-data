Correctness: **False**.

In the provided program, the function `func_1` attempts to calculate the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$. However, there is an issue in the logic of the program that causes it to provide incorrect results.

The problem lies in the condition where it checks if `x` is in `prefix_balances` list. This condition is not correctly defined, as `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values of the prefixes, not the target balance `x`. This can lead to incorrect results being printed when `x` is not in `prefix_balances`. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 2
101
```
The expected output is `1`, as the prefix `101` has a balance of 2. However, the program might output `0` due to the flawed logic in the condition.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case, making the Correctness **False**.
