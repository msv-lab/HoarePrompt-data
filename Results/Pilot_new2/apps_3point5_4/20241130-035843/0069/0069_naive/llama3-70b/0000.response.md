Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input for each test case, calculates the balance of the string, and then determines the number of prefixes with the desired balance according to the problem description. It covers all potential cases where the number of prefixes could be infinite by checking if the difference between the desired balance and the calculated balance is divisible by the difference in counts of 0s and 1s. Thus, the program seems to be handling all cases correctly.
