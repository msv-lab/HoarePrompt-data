Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly checks if all the remainders when dividing `n` by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. It first checks if `k >= n`, if so, it directly returns 'No' since there will be at least one repeating remainder. Then it iterates through all integers from 1 to `k`, calculates the remainder, and checks if it has been seen before. If it has been seen before, it returns 'No' immediately. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to a set of seen remainders. If the loop completes without any repeating remainders, it returns 'Yes'. The program covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
