Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `n` and `k` are assigned values obtained from splitting the input string into integers, `seen` is a set containing the remainder of dividing `n` by 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2, and the `remainder` along with `n % i` has been added to the set `seen`.**
