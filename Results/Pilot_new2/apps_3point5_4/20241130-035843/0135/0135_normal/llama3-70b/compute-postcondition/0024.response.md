Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then iterates from 1 to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each number. If any remainder is found in the set `seen`, it prints 'No' and exits. If no repeated remainder is found, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
