You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting. [Image] 

Some numbers, carved in chaotic order, immediately attracted his attention. Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number n by all integers i from 1 to k. Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all $n \text{mod} i$, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair (i, j) that:   1 ≤ i < j ≤ k,  $n \operatorname{mod} i = n \operatorname{mod} j$, where $x \operatorname{mod} y$ is the remainder of division x by y. 


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).


-----Output-----

Print "Yes", if all the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).


-----Examples-----
Input
4 4

Output
No

Input
5 3

Output
Yes



-----Note-----

In the first sample remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.**
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k >= n) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. k is less than n
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n >= k, k < n, seen_remainders is a set containing all unique remainders of n modulo i for i in the range [1,k]. If any remainder is repeated, the program returns 'No'.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` satisfy 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it returns 'No'. If k is less than n, the function iterates through the range [1, k] to calculate the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. If no remainders are repeated, the function returns 'Yes'. The functionality covers the cases where k is equal to n, k is less than n, and also ensures that all unique remainders are accounted for.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
