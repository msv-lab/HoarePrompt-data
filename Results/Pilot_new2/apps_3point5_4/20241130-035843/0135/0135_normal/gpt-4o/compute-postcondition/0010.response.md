According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is less than `n`, seen_remainders is a set containing the value of n modulo i, and the remainder is not in seen_remainders. Since the loop is iterating from 1 to k+1, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of k should be incremented by 1.
State: **n is greater than or equal to k+1, k is less than n+1, seen_remainders is a set containing the value of n modulo i, and the remainder is not in seen_remainders**
