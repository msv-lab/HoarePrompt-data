Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` satisfy 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it returns 'No'. If k is less than n, the function iterates through the range [1, k] to calculate the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. If no remainders are repeated, the function returns 'Yes'. The functionality covers the cases where k is equal to n, k is less than n, and also ensures that all unique remainders are accounted for.**
