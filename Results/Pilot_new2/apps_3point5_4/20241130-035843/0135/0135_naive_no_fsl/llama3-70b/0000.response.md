Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if the remainder has been seen before. If the remainder is already in the set, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. Finally, if all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". The program handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
