Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem description. The program calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given inputs of the number of blocks, floors, apartments, Edward's apartment number, and Natasha's apartment number. The program calculates the time taken for Edward to exit his apartment, the time taken to walk around the building clockwise or counterclockwise, and the time taken to reach Natasha's floor. Finally, it calculates the total time taken and returns the result, which is then printed.

The program considers all the possible scenarios and correctly calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
