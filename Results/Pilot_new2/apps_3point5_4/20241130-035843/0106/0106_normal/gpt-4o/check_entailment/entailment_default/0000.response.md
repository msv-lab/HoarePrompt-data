Correctness: **False**

The code provided may not always follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the specified conditions. However, there are potential edge cases that are not handled correctly in the code.

One key issue arises when Edward and Natasha live in apartments that are on different blocks but have the same target floor. In this scenario, the code may not consider the additional time needed for Edward to move between blocks before reaching the target floor. This can result in an incorrect calculation of the total time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

To illustrate this problem, consider the following example:
Input:
4 10 5
30 10

Expected Output:
60

In this case, Edward resides in block 4 on the 10th floor, while Natasha lives in block 1 on the 10th floor. The correct minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha should involve moving between blocks and then reaching the 10th floor. However, the current code implementation may not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, based on this potential edge case and the discrepancy between the code's handling of block transitions and the problem description, the correctness of the program is **False**.
