The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`, which is an integer representing the apartment number where Edward or Natasha live. The function then calculates the `block` and `floor` based on the input `apartment`. 
The `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and the `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` representing the apartment number and return the `block` and `floor` where the apartment is located.
