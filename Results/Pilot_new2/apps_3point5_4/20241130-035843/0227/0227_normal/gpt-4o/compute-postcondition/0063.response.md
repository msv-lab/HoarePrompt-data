Output State: `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. If `can_form` is False, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains the next element in the list `a`, `i` is increased by 1, and the loop has finished executing. The current value of `can_form` is still False. `assigned` now contains the element `a[i]`.
