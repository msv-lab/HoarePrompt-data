Postcondition: ***All variables are positive integers. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is True. `x` is the next element in `assigned` and there is at least one more element in `assigned` to iterate over. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
