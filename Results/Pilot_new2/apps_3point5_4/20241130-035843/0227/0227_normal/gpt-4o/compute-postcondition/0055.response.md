According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `assigned`. If `assigned` has at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains the next element in the list `a`, `i` is increased by 1, `assigned` must have at least one element, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and the current value of `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `assigned` must contain at least one more element.
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains the next element in the list `a`, `i` is increased by 1, `assigned` must have at least two elements, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, the current value of `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`**
