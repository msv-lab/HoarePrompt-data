Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i` are all positive integers. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. If there exists a pair of elements in `assigned` such that the difference between them is equal to any element in the list `a`, `can_form` is True. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. After all iterations, `m` contains the number of times `can_form` was False, and `assigned` contains all elements of list `a`.**
