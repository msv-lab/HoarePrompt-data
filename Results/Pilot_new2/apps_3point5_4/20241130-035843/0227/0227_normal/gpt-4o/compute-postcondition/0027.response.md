Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `a`, `assigned` contain at least 1 element. `m`, `i` are all positive integers. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. `can_form` is False. The current value of `n`, `x`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, `can_form` is the same as before. The current value of `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`.***
