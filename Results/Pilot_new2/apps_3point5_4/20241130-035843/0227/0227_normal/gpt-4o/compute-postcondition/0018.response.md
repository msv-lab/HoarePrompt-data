Postcondition: ***`n`, `x` are the next elements in `assigned`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i` are all positive integers, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `can_form` is True. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
