The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a sequence of distinct positive integers. It sorts the sequence and then iterates through the sorted array to find how many times an element is not twice the previous element. The function then prints the count of such occurrences, unless it exceeds 23, in which case it prints -1. Essentially, the function determines the maximum number of elements in the sequence that do not follow the pattern of being twice the previous element.
