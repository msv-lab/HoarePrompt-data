Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an input integer `n` followed by a sequence of distinct positive integers. It then sorts the sequence and iterates through the sorted array to find how many times an element is not twice the previous element. The code correctly determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations. It prints `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise prints -1. The code follows the problem description for every potential case and the output hints agree with the code. Thus, the code is correct.
