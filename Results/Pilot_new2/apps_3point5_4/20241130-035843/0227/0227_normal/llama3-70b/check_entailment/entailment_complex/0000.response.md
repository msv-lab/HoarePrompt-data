Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence and then iterates through it to find how many times an element is not twice the previous element. This directly corresponds to the problem description's requirement of assigning values based on the sum of previous values. 

The program outputs the correct result for all possible cases as it accurately calculates the number of operations required based on the given sequence. Thus, it follows the problem description and is correct.
