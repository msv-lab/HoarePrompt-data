Postcondition: ***'a', 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b'. The condition (a >= b) is true. If 'a' is greater than 'b', the function will execute the if part, otherwise, it will execute the else part. In the if part, 'a' and 'b' remain unchanged. In the else part, 'a' and 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b'. The condition (a >= b) is true, and 'a' is not greater than 'b'.***
