Postcondition: ***'a', 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b'. If 'a' is less than 'b', no change occurs in 'a' and 'b'. If 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b', 'a' and 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b'. The condition (a >= b) is true, and 'a' is not greater than 'b'.***
