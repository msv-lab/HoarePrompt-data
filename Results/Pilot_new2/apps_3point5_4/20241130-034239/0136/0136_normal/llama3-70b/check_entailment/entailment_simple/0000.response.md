Correctness: **True**

The program reads two very large integers as strings and removes any leading zeros. It then compares the two integers and prints "<" if the first integer is less than the second, ">" if the first integer is greater than the second, and "=" if they are equal. The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output based on the comparison of the two integers.
