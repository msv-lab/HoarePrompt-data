Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. It reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, removes leading zeros from both, and then compares them. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '=', if `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<', and if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. The program handles cases where the inputs have leading zeros and ensures that the comparison is done correctly.
