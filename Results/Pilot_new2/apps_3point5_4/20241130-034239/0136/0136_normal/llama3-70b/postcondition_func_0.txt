Functionality: The function takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, each containing no more than 10^6 digits as input. It compares the values of `a` and `b` after removing leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is not equal to `b` and not less than `b`, it continues without any output. It does not calculate the sum of the digits as stated in the annotations. Make sure to handle edge cases where inputs have leading zeros or differ in length.
