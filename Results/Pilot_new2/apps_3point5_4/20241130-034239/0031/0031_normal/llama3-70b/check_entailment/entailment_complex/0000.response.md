Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. The program calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` based on the formula provided in the problem description. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`, updates the values accordingly, and returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` modulo (10^6 + 3).

The program ensures that the values of `numerator` and `denominator` are coprime since it calculates their gcd and divides by it. Additionally, the program correctly handles the large numbers involved by taking the remainders modulo (10^6 + 3) before returning the values.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
