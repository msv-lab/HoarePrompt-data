You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: ZS the Coder has recently found an interesting concept called the Birthday Paradox. It states that given a random set of 23 people, there is around 50% chance that some two of them share the same birthday. ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.

In Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. 

ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?


-----Input-----

The first and only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), meaning that there are 2^{n} days in a year and that ZS the Coder wants to interview exactly k people.


-----Output-----

If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ≥ 0, B ≥ 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.

Since these numbers may be too large, print them modulo 10^6 + 3. Note that A and B must be coprime before their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 are taken.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2

Output
1 8
Input
1 3

Output
1 1
Input
4 3

Output
23 128


-----Note-----

In the first sample case, there are 2^3 = 8 days in Udayland. The probability that 2 people have the same birthday among 2 people is clearly $\frac{1}{8}$, so A = 1, B = 8.

In the second sample case, there are only 2^1 = 2 days in Udayland, but there are 3 people, so it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday. Thus, the probability is 1 and A = B = 1.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Input**: The input consists of two integers, \(n\) and \(k\) (1 ≤ \(n\) ≤ \(10^{18}\), 2 ≤ \(k\) ≤ \(10^{18}\), representing the number of days in a year (2^n) and the number of people interviewed (k) by ZS the Coder.

**Output**: The output should be two integers, A and B, representing the irreducible fraction A/B where A and B are coprime and must be printed modulo 10^6 + 3.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The loop will execute multiple times until `b` becomes 0. After the loop finishes, `a` will store the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `a` stores the GCD and `b` becomes 0 after the loop finishes.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.**
def func_2(n, k):
    MOD = 10 ** 6 + 3
    if (k > 1 << n) :
        print(1, 1)
        return
        #The program returns the current value of 'k' after shifting it left by 'n' bits, where 'k' is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and 'n' is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`MOD` is assigned the value 1000003. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. `k` is less than or equal to 1 shifted left by `n`.
    total_days = 1 << n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD
        
        denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `MOD` is assigned the value 1000003, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that k is greater than or equal to 1, `total_days` is equal to 2 to the power of n, `numerator` is assigned the value calculated by `numerator * (total_days - k) % MOD`, `denominator` is assigned the value `total_days^k % MOD`
    p_no_shared = numerator
    p_total = denominator
    p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
    A = p_shared
    B = p_total
    g = func_1(A, B)
    A //= g
    B //= g
    print(A % MOD, B % MOD)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
