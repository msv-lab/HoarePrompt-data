The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The resulting GCD is stored in `a`, and `b` becomes 0 after the loop finishes. The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is stored in `a` and must be printed modulo 10^6 + 3.
