Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It uses a formula to calculate the probability as an irreducible fraction and then reduces the fraction before taking the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3. The program handles the given constraints and requirements of the problem description. The implementation is mathematically sound and should work correctly for all possible inputs within the constraints specified.
