Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description states that Memory should be able to modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle at any moment of time. However, the provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y and prints the result, without actually performing the necessary operations to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
