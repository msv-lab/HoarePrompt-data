Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting with the equilateral triangle of side length x. It follows the problem description by reading two integers x and y within the specified range, and then calculating the result as ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2) which represents the minimum number of seconds required.

The program ensures that the sides of the triangle remain integers and non-degenerate throughout the process. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
