Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two integers x and y as input, where x is the starting equilateral triangle side length and y is the ending equilateral triangle side length. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y based on the formula ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2) and prints the output.

The code follows the problem description for all potential cases as it correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required based on the given conditions. The formula used in the code aligns with the logic provided in the problem description, making it a correct solution. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.
