Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m`, `r` is updated to the remainder of the previous value of `r` divided by `s[i]`, `s_i`, `b_i` are unchanged, `s` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is updated to the floor division of the sum of shares and r divided by s[i], `i` is 1. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], then r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r is less than s[i], the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
