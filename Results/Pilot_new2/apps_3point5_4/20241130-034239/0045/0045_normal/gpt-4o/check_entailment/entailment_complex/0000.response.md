Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, calculates the minimum sum based on `k`, checks if the minimum sum exceeds `n`, and returns -1 if it does. Otherwise, it constructs a list `sequence` containing `k` elements that are strictly increasing and have a sum equal to `n`. The greatest common divisor of this sequence is maximized. The program outputs the correct sequence when it exists and outputs -1 when there is no possible sequence. The annotations provided in the code also match the steps described in the problem description.
