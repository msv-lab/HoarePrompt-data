According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, and `i` remain the same as the initial state, and `remainder` is decreased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to one less than its current value.
State: **`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, and `i` remain the same as the initial state, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is one less than its current value**
