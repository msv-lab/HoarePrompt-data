Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly takes input for n and k.
- It then checks if n is less than k and if so, prints -1.
- Otherwise, it generates a sequence of k positive numbers starting from 1, increasing by 1 each time, such that their sum is equal to n. This ensures a strictly increasing sequence with the maximum possible greatest common divisor.
- If the generated sequence does not have exactly k elements, it prints -1.
- The output format is also correct, printing the resulting sequence if it exists. 

The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints confirm the correct functionality of the code.
