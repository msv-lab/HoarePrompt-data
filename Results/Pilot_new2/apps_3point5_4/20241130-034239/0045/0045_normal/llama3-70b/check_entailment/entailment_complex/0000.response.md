Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not actually solve the problem described in the problem description. The program only contains a function `func_1` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, the problem description requires generating a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers that sum up to a given number `n` and have the maximum GCD possible.

The program does not include any logic to generate such a sequence of numbers. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
