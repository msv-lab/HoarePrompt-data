According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b` and `b` is equal to the previous value of `a` modulo `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, the initial values of `a` and `b` must have been such that `b` was not equal to 0. Additionally, after the previous iteration, `a` should now be equal to the value of `b` and `b` should now be equal to the value of `a` modulo `b` for the loop to proceed.
State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, a is now equal to the previous value of b, b is now equal to the previous value of a modulo b and b must not be equal to 0**
