Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes in two integers, n and k, and then tries to create a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal. It then outputs the resulting sequence or -1 if the answer does not exist.

The program first checks if n is less than k, in which case it prints -1. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to k, adding numbers to the sequence if n is greater than or equal to the current number. If at the end, the length of the sequence is not equal to k, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence.

The logic of the program correctly follows the problem description by creating a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is n and the greatest common divisor is maximal. The program handles the edge case of n < k by outputting -1 and ensures that the resulting sequence is strictly increasing and has the correct sum. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
