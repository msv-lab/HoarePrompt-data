Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the minimum sum that can be achieved with k numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than n, if so, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence in that case.
3. It then calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It calculates the remainder by subtracting d * min_sum from n.
5. It then creates a sequence by multiplying each number by d starting from 1 up to k.
6. It then distributes the remainder among the numbers in the sequence in a way that the greatest common divisor remains maximal.
7. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence or -1 if no sequence is possible. 

The program covers all possible cases and generates a sequence that meets the requirements of the problem description.
