Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a string received by Kate and a substring that Vasya remembers as input. It then generates all possible numbers by permuting the remaining characters after removing the substring from the input string. It checks for each possible number if it is a valid number (contains the remembered substring and has the same length as the original number) and returns the smallest valid number. The program logic follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
