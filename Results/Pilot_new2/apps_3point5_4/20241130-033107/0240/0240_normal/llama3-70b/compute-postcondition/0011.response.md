Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer that is not empty, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string with the character `c` appended to the end if `c` is in `t_set` and `n` is the original `n` plus `c` if `c` is in `t_set`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` has `c` appended to the end. Otherwise, `n` remains the same.***
