The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `t`. Parameter `s` is a string representing a very large integer, and `t` is a substring of `s`. After executing the function body, the program returns the integer value of `n` after being increased by the initial value of `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `s` representing a very large integer and a substring `t` of `s`, and return the integer value of `n` after increasing it by the initial value of `t`.
