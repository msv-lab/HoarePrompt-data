Function number 1:
The function `func_1` appears to correctly address the problem description by taking a large integer string `s` and a remembered substring `sub`, then finding the smallest possible initial integer `n` that could have been passed to Kate. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing `sub`, generates possible numbers using the remaining characters and `sub`, and returns the smallest number based on their integer values.

Function number 2:
The function `is_valid_number` checks if a given number string `num_str` is valid by ensuring that the remembered substring `sub` is present in `num_str` and the length of `num_str` matches `n_len`. This provides a necessary validity check for the numbers generated in `func_1`.

Function number 3:
The function `generate_possible_numbers` generates all possible permutations of the characters in `chars` and yields those permutations that form valid numbers with the substring `sub`. However, it mentions an essential function `is_valid_number` that is not included in the provided code, which is needed for complete functionality. This missing function could potentially lead to invalid numbers being considered as valid.

Output hints for function 1, 2, and 3:
The output descriptions align with the code functionality and provide a clear understanding of the purpose of each function. They emphasize the process of finding the smallest initial integer `n` by considering the remaining characters in the large integer string `s` after removing the remembered substring `sub`, generating possible numbers, and ensuring their validity.

After analyzing the code and the provided descriptions, it seems that the program is not able to handle all potential cases correctly. The missing `is_valid_number` function in `generate_possible_numbers` could lead to incorrect numbers being considered valid, thus not meeting the problem description requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
