Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by taking in the string received by Kate and the substring Vasya remembers. It then constructs the smallest integer n possible by including only the characters that are in the remembered substring and appending the remembered substring at the end. The program handles the case of leading zeroes correctly as well. The logic of the program seems sound and there are no obvious edge cases where it would fail to produce the correct output.
