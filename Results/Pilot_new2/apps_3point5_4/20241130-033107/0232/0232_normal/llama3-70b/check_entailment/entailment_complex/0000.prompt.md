You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.


-----Example-----
Input
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
1 2

Output
YES
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n. The list of colors of the lightsabers contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. The list of desired counts of lightsabers for each color contains m integers such that the sum of all desired counts is between 1 and n inclusive.**
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    colors = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counts = list(map(int, input().split()))
    color_counts = {}
    for color in colors:
        if color not in color_counts:
            color_counts[color] = 0
        
        color_counts[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n, m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers, counts is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers, color_counts is a dictionary with each unique color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value. The dictionary will contain all unique colors from the colors list with their respective counts.
    found = False
    for i in range(n):
        window_counts = {}
        
        for j in range(i, n):
            color = colors[j]
            if color not in window_counts:
                window_counts[color] = 0
            window_counts[color] += 1
            if all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.
                values()), counts)):
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: At the end of the loop execution, `found` is True. The loop will break at some index `i` and `j` will be equal to `n`. `window_counts` will contain each color from `colors[i]` to `colors[n-1]` with their respective counts sorted in the same order as the corresponding targets in `counts`. `color_counts` will remain the same as the original dictionary.
    print('YES' if found else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for the number of lightsabers and their colors, processes the data to check if there exists a subsequence of colors that matches the desired counts, and prints 'YES' if such a subsequence is found, 'NO' otherwise. The function handles cases where the desired counts are not achievable or where the provided input does not meet the constraints.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
