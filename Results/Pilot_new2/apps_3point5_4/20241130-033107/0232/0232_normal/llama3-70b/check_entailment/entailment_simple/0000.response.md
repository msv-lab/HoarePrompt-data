Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values, counts the occurrences of each color in the list, and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals to check if the count of each color matches the desired count. If such an interval exists, it sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints "YES" if `found` is True, and "NO" otherwise.

The program follows the problem description as it accurately determines if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists. It checks all possible intervals and correctly compares the color counts to the desired counts. Therefore, the program is correct.
