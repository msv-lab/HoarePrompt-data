Output State: **n, m+1 are positive integers such that 1 <= m+1 <= n, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers, counts is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers, color_counts is a dictionary with the key 'color' and value incremented by 2, colors list must have at least 1 color, m+1 is the length of the colors list increased by 1, color is the (m+1)th color in the list, if color is not already in color_counts, then color_counts[color] is 1.**
