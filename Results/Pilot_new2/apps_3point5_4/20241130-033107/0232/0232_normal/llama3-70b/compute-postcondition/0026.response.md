Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each unique color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` and the value incremented by 1 if `color` was not in `window_counts` initially, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than `i`, and `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list.**
