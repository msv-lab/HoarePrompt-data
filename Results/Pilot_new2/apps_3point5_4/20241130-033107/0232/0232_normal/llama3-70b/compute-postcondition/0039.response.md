State: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each unique color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `window_counts` is a dictionary with each unique color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value after sorting, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each unique color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, `color` is equal to `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged. If all counts in sorted `window_counts.values()` match the corresponding `counts`, the program state remains the same.
