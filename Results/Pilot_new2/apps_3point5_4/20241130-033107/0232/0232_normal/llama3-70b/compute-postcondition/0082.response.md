Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, if the condition `(found)` is satisfied, `found` will be True. `i` will be an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` will be equal to `n`, `n` will be an integer greater than or equal to 1. `window_counts` will contain the keys `colors[i]` to `colors[n-1]` with their respective counts. All counts in `window_counts` will be equal to the corresponding targets in `counts` in a sorted manner. `color_counts` will remain the same, and `color` will be the color at index `n-1` in the list `colors`. Additionally, after the if condition `(found)` is satisfied and we break out of the loop or if statement.***
