Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. It uses two pointers to keep track of the current counts of each color and iterates through the Jedi Knights' colors to determine if the desired counts are met within a contiguous interval. The program returns 'YES' if such an interval is found, and 'NO' otherwise. The program handles all potential cases specified in the problem description and provides the correct output.
