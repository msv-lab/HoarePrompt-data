Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values, calculates the color counts for each window of Jedi Knights, and checks if there exists a contiguous interval with the prescribed color counts. The program uses nested loops to iterate through all possible windows efficiently and checks if the color counts match the desired counts. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description, and there are no missing edge cases identified where the program would fail to provide the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
