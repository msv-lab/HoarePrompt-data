Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It rounds the given integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is divisible by 10, it means it already ends with 0, so it prints the value of `n`. If not divisible by 10, it rounds down if the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, and rounds up if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5. The code covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
