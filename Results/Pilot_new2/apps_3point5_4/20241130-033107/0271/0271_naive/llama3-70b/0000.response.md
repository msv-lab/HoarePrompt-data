Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It checks if the given number ends with 0, then it rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference to the next 10. The program covers all possible cases and provides the correct output according to the problem statement.
