Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes an input string and checks if it is an "s-palindrome" by iterating through the string and comparing characters at opposite ends.
- The function `func_1` correctly checks if the characters at index `i` and `n - 1 - i` are equal for all `i` up to `n // 2`.
- The code follows the problem description as it accurately identifies "s-palindromes" based on the symmetric property described.
- The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, and all the examples provided in the problem description also work correctly, ensuring the correctness of the program.
