Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z, calculates the minimum and maximum values for upvotes and downvotes based on these inputs, and then determines the result ('+', '-', or '?') according to the rules outlined in the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and produces the expected output for each case. Hence, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
