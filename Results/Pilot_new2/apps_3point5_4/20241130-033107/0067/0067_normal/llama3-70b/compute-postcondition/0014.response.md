Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The condition (x <= y + z) is true. `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. `x` is not equal to `y`, and the relationship `x <= y` is maintained.**
