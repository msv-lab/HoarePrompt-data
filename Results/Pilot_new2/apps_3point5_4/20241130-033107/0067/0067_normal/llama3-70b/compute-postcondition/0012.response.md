Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. The condition (x <= y + z) is true. `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. In the current state, `x` is equal to `y`. If z == 0, then after the execution, `z` is set to 0. If z is not equal to 0, then `x` is still equal to `y`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and z is not equal to 0.***
