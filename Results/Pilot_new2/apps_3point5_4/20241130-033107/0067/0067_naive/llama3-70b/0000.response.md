Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If `x > y + z`, it means there are more upvotes than downvotes, so the result is "+". This covers the case when there are more upvotes than downvotes.
- If `x < y`, it means there are more downvotes than upvotes, so the result is "-". This covers the case when there are more downvotes than upvotes.
- If `x == y`, it means there are equal votes, so the result depends on the value of `z`.
  - If `z == 0`, then the result is "0".
  - If `z != 0`, then there are two possible outcomes depending on whether the unknown voters upvote or downvote, hence the result is "?".
- If none of the above conditions are met, it means the result is uncertain and should be "?". This covers all possible cases as per the problem description.
