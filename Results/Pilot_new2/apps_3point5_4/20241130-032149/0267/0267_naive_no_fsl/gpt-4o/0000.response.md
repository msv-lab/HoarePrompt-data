Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions, `func_1` which checks if a number has at most `k` different digits, and `func_2` which calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition in `func_1`. The program then takes input for `l`, `r`, and `k`, calls `func_2` with these inputs, and prints the result.

The program iterates through each number from `l` to `r`, checks if it has at most `k` different digits using `func_1`, and adds it to the total sum if it satisfies the condition. The final result is calculated modulo `998244353`.

The logic implemented in the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
