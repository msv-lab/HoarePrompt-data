Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function `count` calculates the count of such numbers within a range efficiently using dynamic programming. The main function `func_1` then calculates the final sum by subtracting the count for $l-1$ from the count for $r$, modulo $998244353$. The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
