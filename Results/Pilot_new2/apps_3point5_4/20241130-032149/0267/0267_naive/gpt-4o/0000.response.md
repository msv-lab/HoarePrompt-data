Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, to check if a number contains at most k different digits and calculate the sum of numbers from l to r that satisfy this condition, respectively. The program then reads the input values for l, r, and k, calls func_2, and prints the result.

The program iterates through numbers from l to r and checks if the number contains at most k different digits using func_1. If the condition is met, the number is added to the total sum modulo 998244353.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description as it correctly calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that contain at most k different digits. The implementation covers all potential cases, including edge cases, and provides the expected output based on the problem statement. Thus, the program is correct.
