Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions, func_1 and func_2, that work together to calculate the sum of numbers from l to r such that each number contains at most k different digits. The functions correctly handle the constraints provided in the problem description (1 <= l <= r < 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10) and follow the logic described in the problem statement.

func_1 checks if the number of unique digits in a given integer is less than or equal to k, which is essential for determining if a number satisfies the condition of having at most k different digits. This function is used in func_2 to filter out numbers that do not meet the criteria.

func_2 iterates through the range [l, r] and accumulates the sum of numbers that satisfy the condition specified in func_1. The sum is calculated correctly by adding each valid number and taking the modulo MOD as required. The output of func_2 is the sum of all numbers within the specified range that meet the criteria.

Since the code implements the correct logic based on the problem description and handles the given constraints effectively, it can be considered correct.
