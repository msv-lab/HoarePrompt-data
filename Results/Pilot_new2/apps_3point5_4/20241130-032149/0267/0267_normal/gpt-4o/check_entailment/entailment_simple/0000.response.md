Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and then print this sum modulo `998244353`. 

The `func_1` function correctly determines if a given number `n` has at most `k` different digits by converting the number to a string, finding the unique digits, and checking if the count of unique digits is less than or equal to `k`. This function is essential for filtering out numbers that do not meet the criteria specified in the problem description.

The `func_2` function iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]` and calls `func_1` to determine if the number satisfies the condition of having at most `k` different digits. If the condition is met, the number is added to the total sum, which is calculated modulo `998244353`. The function then returns the final sum as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and ensures that the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` with at most `k` different digits is calculated and returned modulo `998244353`.
