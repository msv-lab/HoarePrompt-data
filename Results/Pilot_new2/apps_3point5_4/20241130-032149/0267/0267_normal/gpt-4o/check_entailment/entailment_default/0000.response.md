Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be correctly implemented based on the problem description.
- `func_1` checks if the number of unique digits in a given number `n` is less than or equal to `k`, which aligns with the condition provided in the problem description.
- `func_2` iterates through the range `[l, r]` and calculates the sum of all numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits. It correctly considers all numbers in the range and updates the total sum accordingly.
- The code handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as the constraints on input values for `l`, `r`, and `k`.
- The output hints also align with the code and provide a clear explanation of what each function does, without introducing any contradictory cases.

Therefore, based on the initial assessment and considering the output hints, the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
