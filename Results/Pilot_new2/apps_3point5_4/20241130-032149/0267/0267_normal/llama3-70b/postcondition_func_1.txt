The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. Parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary. The function calculates a value based on the conditions provided in the code and stores it in the dictionary `dp` at key (n, k). The function then returns this calculated value. If the calculated value is already present in the dictionary, the function retrieves and returns it. In case none of the conditions are met, the function returns 0.
