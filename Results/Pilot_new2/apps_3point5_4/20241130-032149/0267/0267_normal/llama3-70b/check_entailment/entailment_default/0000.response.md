Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions, `func_1` and `count`, to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`.
- The `func_1` function acts as a coordinator for invoking the `count` function with the given parameters `l`, `r`, `k`, and an empty dictionary `dp`. It then computes the result based on the returned values from the `count` function.
- The `count` function calculates the value based on the conditions provided in the code. It handles cases where `k = 0`, calculates the sum efficiently for numbers with at most `k` different digits, and stores the calculated values in the dictionary `dp` for future reference.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no evident edge cases or scenarios where the code fails to meet the specified requirements. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, providing additional clarity on how the calculations are performed.
