Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits by utilizing the `count` function. The `count` function recursively calculates the count of valid numbers for a given `n` and `k` based on the constraints provided in the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases and ensures that the final result is modulo `998244353`, as required. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
