According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than 2. Since the loop is iterating over the range from 1 to k exclusive, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration would be:
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, k is greater than 1, i is 3, dp[n, k] = 9 and dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * 10, dp[n, k] += 9 * 10**
