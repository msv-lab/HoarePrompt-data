#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10
def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #The program returns the result of the calculation (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD, where l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is an empty dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k within the specified constraints and returns the result of a calculation involving these parameters and an empty dictionary dp. The calculation is (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD where count is a function that is expected to be defined elsewhere. However, the actual functionality heavily relies on the implementation of the count function, which is not provided in this code snippet. Therefore, the function func_1 acts as a coordinator for invoking the count function with the given parameters and computing the result based on the returned values.

    if (n < 10 ** k) :
        dp[n, k] = n

        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. dp is a dictionary. k is not equal to 0. If n < 10
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value stored in the dictionary dp at key (n, k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. Parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary. The function calculates a value based on the conditions provided in the code and stores it in the dictionary `dp` at key (n, k). The function then returns this calculated value. If the calculated value is already present in the dictionary, the function retrieves and returns it. In case none of the conditions are met, the function returns 0.
