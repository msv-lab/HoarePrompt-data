Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a string `s` and iterates over it along with the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to match characters. It increments the index `j` if the characters in `s` match the sequence in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' consecutively. If `j` reaches the length of the target sequence, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; otherwise, it prints -1. The code follows the problem description as it checks if the input string `s` contains the sequence 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in order. The code handles the case where it is impossible to form the English alphabet as a subsequence correctly by printing -1. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
