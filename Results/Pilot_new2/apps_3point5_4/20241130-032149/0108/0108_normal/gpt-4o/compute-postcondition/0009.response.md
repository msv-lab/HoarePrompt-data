According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables i and j, as well as the lengths of s and target. If i is less than the length of s and j is less than the length of target, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the condition for the loop to execute one more time would be that i is less than the length of s, j is less than target_len, and the character at index i in s is equal to the character at index j in target. 
State: **s is a string consisting of |s| small English letters where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5, target is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', target_len is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', i is less than len(s)+1, j is less than target_len, and the character at index i in s is equal to the character at index j in target.**
