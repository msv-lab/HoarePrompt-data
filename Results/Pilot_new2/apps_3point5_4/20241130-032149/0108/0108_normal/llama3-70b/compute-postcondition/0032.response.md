According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has the next character in `alphabet` replaced by the character that comes after it, `res` includes all unique characters replaced, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that is not present in `s` and is no longer in `s`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. 
State: **`s` has the next character in `alphabet` replaced by the character that comes after it, `res` includes all unique characters replaced, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that is not present in `s` and `char` is in `s`**
