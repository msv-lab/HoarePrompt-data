Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The provided program reads an input string `s` and checks if the characters in the string match the characters of the alphabet in order. If they do, it prints the alphabet, otherwise, it prints -1. The program iterates through both the input string and the target alphabet to check for a match. If at the end of the iteration, all characters of the alphabet are matched, it prints the alphabet. If not, it prints -1.

The program covers all potential cases where the input string can be transformed into the English alphabet as a subsequence. It correctly handles the scenario where the input string has all the necessary characters to form the alphabet sequence and also the scenario where it does not. Therefore, the program is correct.
