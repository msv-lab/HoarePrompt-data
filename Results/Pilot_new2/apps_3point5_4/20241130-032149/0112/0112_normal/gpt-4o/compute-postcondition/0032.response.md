According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and digit is in cube_faces[i], then `used_cubes[i]` becomes True, `found` becomes True, `i` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values with `used_cubes[i]` is False and digit is not in cube_faces[i] for the next iteration, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1 if the loop continues**
