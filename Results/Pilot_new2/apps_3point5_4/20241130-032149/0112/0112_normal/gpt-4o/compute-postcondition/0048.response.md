According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the initial values of `num`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, and `found` are maintained. 
State: **`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `found` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
