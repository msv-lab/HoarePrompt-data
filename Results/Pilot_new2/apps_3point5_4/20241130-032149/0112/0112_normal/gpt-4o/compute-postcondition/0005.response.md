Postcondition: ***num is a list of n tuples, digits is a list of strings with at least 1 element, used_cubes is a list of n False values, found is False, i is 0, n must be greater than 0. If (not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]), then the current value of used_cubes[i] is False and digit is in cube_faces[i].***
