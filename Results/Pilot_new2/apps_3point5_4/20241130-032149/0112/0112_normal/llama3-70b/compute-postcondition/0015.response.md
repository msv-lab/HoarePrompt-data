The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the input such that 1 <= n <= 3. Then, for each of the n lines, it reads 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes, where each number is between 0 and 9 inclusive. The function does not return anything. 

Functionality: **The function reads an integer n followed by n lines of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes.**
