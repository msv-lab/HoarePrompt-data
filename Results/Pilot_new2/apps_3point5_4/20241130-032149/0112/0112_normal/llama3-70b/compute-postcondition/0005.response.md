According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has more cubes, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers entered by the user for the respective cube and must have at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least one more cube added to it.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers entered by the user for the respective cube and must have at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube**
