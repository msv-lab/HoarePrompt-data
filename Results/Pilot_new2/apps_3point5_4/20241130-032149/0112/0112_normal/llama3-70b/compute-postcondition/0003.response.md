According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop executes. At the start of the loop, the digits set is empty. So for the loop to be executed the cubes list must have at least 1 cube, and the cube is the first cube in the list.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers entered by the user for the respective cube and must have at least 1 cube, digits is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the list**
