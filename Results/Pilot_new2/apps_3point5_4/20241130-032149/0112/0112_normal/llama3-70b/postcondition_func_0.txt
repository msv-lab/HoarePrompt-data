The function reads an integer n followed by n lines of 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes. It then extracts all unique digits present in the cubes, removes '0' if it exists, calculates the maximum possible number by sorting the digits in descending order and joining them, and finally prints this maximum number.
