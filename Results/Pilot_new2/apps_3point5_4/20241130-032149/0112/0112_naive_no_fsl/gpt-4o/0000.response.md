Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of cubes and the faces of each cube.
2. The `can_form_number` function correctly checks if a given number can be formed using the faces of the cubes without violating the rule of not being able to make 6 from 9 and vice-versa.
3. The main function `func_1` iterates through numbers starting from 1 and checks if each number can be formed using the faces of the cubes. It returns the maximum number that can be formed.
4. The program uses a brute-force approach to find the maximum number x, which is a valid approach given the constraints of the problem.
5. The program is able to handle multiple test cases and provides the correct output as shown in the examples provided.
