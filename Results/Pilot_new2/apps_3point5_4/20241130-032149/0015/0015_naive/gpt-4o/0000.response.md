Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, then it will print 'YES', which is correct.
2. If the difference between the favorite number and the first element is 0, then it will print 'NO', which is correct.
3. If the favorite number can be obtained by adding multiples of the difference to the first element of the sequence and the result is non-negative, then it will print 'YES', which is correct.
4. Otherwise, it will print 'NO', which covers all other cases where the favorite number does not appear in the sequence, hence the program is correct for all potential cases.
