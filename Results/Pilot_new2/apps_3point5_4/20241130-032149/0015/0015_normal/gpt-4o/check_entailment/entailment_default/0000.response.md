Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.
- It first checks if `b` is equal to `a`, and if so, prints 'YES', which aligns with the problem description.
- If `b` is not equal to `a`, it then checks if `c` is equal to 0 and prints 'NO' in that case, which also follows the problem description.
- Finally, if `c` is not 0 and the condition `(b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0` is met, it prints 'YES', which corresponds to the requirement that the favorite number `b` should appear in the sequence, and the difference between neighboring elements should be `c`.
- Therefore, the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
