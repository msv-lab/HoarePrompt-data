Functionality: **The function takes three integer inputs a, b, and c. It then checks if b is equal to a and prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it further checks if c is 0, printing 'NO' in that case. If c is not 0, it verifies whether (b - a) is divisible by c and the division result is non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
