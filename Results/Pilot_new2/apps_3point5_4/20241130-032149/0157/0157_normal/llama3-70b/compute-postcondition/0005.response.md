The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 1 <= a, b, c <= 1000. The function calculates the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` and returns the result.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates the sum of three positive integers a, b, and c (1 <= a, b, c <= 1000) and returns the result.**
