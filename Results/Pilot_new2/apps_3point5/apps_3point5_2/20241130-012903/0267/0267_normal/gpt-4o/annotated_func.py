#State of the program right berfore the function call: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the count of unique digits in the string representation of integer n is less than or equal to k, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number to be evaluated and `k` represents the maximum number of unique digits allowed in `n`. The function returns True if the count of unique digits in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns False. The code accurately checks if the count of unique digits is within the specified limit. However, potential edge cases or missing functionalities could include handling non-integer inputs or scenarios where `n` is negative, which are not addressed in the current implementation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is (r + 1), `r` is r, `k` is k, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of all numbers in the range from l to r where each number satisfies func_1(num, k).
    return total_sum
    #The program returns the total sum of all numbers in the range from l to r where each number satisfies func_1(num, k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts three integers l, r, and k with specific constraints and calculates the total sum of all numbers in the range from l to r, including r, where each number satisfies the condition specified by func_1(num, k). The function then returns this total sum.
