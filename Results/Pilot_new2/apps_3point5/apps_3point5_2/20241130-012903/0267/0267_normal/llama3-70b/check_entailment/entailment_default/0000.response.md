Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly defines two functions, `func_1` and `count`, to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits.
- The `func_1` function takes in the input values `l`, `r`, and `k`, initializes a dictionary `dp`, calculates the count of numbers divisible by `k` in the range from `l` to `r`, and subtracts the count of numbers divisible by `k` in the range from 1 to `l-1`. The result is then returned after taking the modulo `MOD`.
- The `count` function calculates and stores values in the dictionary `dp` based on defined conditions. It handles cases where `k` is 0, calculates the values based on specific formulas, and returns the final value.
- The output hints describe the functions' functionality accurately and provide a clear understanding of how the functions work to achieve the desired result.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as per the problem description, and the output hints do not point out any discrepancies or missing edge cases. Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, the program appears to be correct for all scenarios.
