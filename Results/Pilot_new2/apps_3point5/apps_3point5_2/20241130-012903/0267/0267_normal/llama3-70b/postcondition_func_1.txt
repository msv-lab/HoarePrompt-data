Functionality: The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n`, `k`, and `dp` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary. The function calculates and stores values in the dictionary `dp` based on certain conditions. If k is 0, the function returns 0. If the pair (n, k) is already present in the dictionary dp, it returns the corresponding value. Otherwise, it calculates `dp[n, k]` based on the defined formulas and returns the final value stored in dp at key (n, k).
