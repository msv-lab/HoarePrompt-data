According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`, `char_next`, and `char`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` does not contain the character `char_next`, which means `char_next` is not in `s` and thus the loop cannot execute. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to contain the character `char_next` in order for `char` to be in `s`.
State: **`s` must contain the character `char_next`, `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to `char_next` in order**
