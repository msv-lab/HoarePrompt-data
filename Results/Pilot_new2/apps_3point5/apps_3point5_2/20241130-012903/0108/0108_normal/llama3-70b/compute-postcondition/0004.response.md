According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string, and `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string and `char` is in `s`**
