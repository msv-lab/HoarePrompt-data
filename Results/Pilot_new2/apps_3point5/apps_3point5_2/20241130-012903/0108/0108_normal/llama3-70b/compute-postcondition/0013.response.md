The loop will iterate through the string `s`, replacing each occurrence of `char` with the next character in the `alphabet` string, and adding `char` to the `res` string each time. The loop will execute as long as `char` exists in `s`.

Output State: **`s` does not contain the character `char`, `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to `char` in order**
