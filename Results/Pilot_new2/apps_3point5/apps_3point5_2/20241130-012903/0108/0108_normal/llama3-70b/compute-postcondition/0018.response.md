According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains the character `char_next`, and `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to `char_next` in order with an additional character `char` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. For the loop to execute one more time, the character `char` in `s` needs to be adjusted to the character that comes after it in the alphabet.
State: **`s` contains the character that comes after `char_next`, `res` is a string consisting of all characters from `alphabet` up to `char_next` in order with an additional character `char` replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet**
