According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` does not contain the character `char_next`, so it needs to be adjusted so that `char` is in `s`. Additionally, the loop will execute one more time if `char_next` is not the last character in the alphabet. 
State: **`s` must contain the character `char_next` and `char_next` must not be the last character in the alphabet**
