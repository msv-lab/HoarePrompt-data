According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet` string. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the `alphabet` string. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string**
