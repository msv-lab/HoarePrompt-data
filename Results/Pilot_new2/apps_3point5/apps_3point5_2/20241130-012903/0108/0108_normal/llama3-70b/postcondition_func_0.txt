The function `func` reads a string consisting of only lowercase English letters. It then iterates over the alphabet and for each character, it appends it to a result string in order by replacing occurrences of that character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet. After processing all characters in the alphabet, if the result string contains all 26 letters, it is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
