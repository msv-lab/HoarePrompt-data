According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains the character `char_next` except `char_next` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet, and `char_next` must not be the last character in the alphabet. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the alphabet after `char_next`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` contains the character `char_next` except `char_next` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet, `res` contains the concatenation of the previous `res` value and `char_next`, and `char` must be updated to the next character in the alphabet after `char_next`**
