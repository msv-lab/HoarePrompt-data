Correctness: **True**

The program takes an input string `s` and checks if the characters in the string can form the English alphabet as a subsequence. It does this by iterating over the string `s` and checking if each character matches the corresponding character in the English alphabet.

If the characters in `s` can form the English alphabet as a subsequence, it will output the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If not, it will output -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description and outputs the expected result for all possible inputs, making it correct.
