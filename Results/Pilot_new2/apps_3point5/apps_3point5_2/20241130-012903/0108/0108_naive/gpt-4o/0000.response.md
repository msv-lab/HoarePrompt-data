Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input string.
2. It iterates through the input string and the target alphabet string simultaneously, checking if the characters match.
3. If the program reaches the end of the target alphabet string, it means the input string contains the English alphabet as a subsequence, and it prints the target alphabet string.
4. If the program does not reach the end of the target alphabet string, it means it was not able to form the English alphabet as a subsequence, and it prints -1.
5. The program handles the case where it is impossible to form the English alphabet as a subsequence by returning -1.
