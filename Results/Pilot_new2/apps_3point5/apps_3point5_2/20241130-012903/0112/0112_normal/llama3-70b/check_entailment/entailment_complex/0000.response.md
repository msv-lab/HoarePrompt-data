Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The program only considers the digits on the cubes and finds the maximum number that can be formed by combining these digits. However, the problem description states that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This condition is not checked in the provided program.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the complete requirements of the problem description.
