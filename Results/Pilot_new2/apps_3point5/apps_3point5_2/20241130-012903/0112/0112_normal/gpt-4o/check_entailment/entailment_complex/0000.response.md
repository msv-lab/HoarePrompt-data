Correctness: **False**

In the provided code, the `can_form_number` function does not handle cases where the input `num` is not a positive integer. The function assumes that `num` is always greater than 0, which does not align with the problem description. If `num` is not a positive integer, the function might not return the correct result, leading to incorrect outcomes. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
