Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The annotated program provided correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes according to the problem description. 

1. Function 1 iterates over numbers from 1 upwards, checking if each number can be formed using the available cubes by calling Function 2. The loop continues until a number cannot be formed anymore, and then returns the maximum number x that can be formed.

2. Function 2 checks if a given number can be formed using the available cubes. It iterates over the digits of the number and for each digit, it checks if there is a cube face that contains that digit and has not been used yet. If a cube face is found for each digit, the function returns True, indicating that the number can be formed.

The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem description, and the functions work together to find the maximum number x that can be formed using Masha's cubes.
