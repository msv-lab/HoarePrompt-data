According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, next `cube_face` in `cube_faces`, `found` is True, and `i` is adjusted accordingly. The current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the next iteration should happen. Therefore, we need to adjust the following states:
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, next `cube_face` in `cube_faces`, `found` is True, `i` is adjusted accordingly (i+1), and the current value of `used_cubes[i+1]` should be False, and `digit` should not be in `cube_faces[i+1] for the loop to execute one more time.
