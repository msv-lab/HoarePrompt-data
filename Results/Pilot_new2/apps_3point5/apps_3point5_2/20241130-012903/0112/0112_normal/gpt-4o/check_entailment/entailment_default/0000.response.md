First, let's analyze the provided code based on the problem description and the two functions given.

The `can_form_number` function iterates through the digits of a given number and checks if each digit can be formed using available cube faces. It then updates the status of used cubes and returns True if all digits can be formed, otherwise False. This function seems to correctly handle the logic required to determine if a number can be formed using the given cubes.

The `func_1` function calculates the maximum number `x` that Masha can make using her cubes by incrementing `x` until a condition defined in the `can_form_number` function is met. The function returns the final value of `x` increased by 3. This approach aligns with the problem description as it aims to find the maximum number that can be formed.

Now, let's see if the output hints support the code logic:

The output hints describe the functions accurately and provide insights into what the code is expected to do. The `can_form_number` function correctly checks if all digits of a number can be formed using the available cube faces. Additionally, the `func_1` function iterates to find the maximum number that can be formed using the cubes. The hints do not provide any contradictory information or scenarios that the code does not handle.

Considering both the code and the output hints, it seems like the code is correctly implemented and follows the problem description for every potential case. 

Correctness: **True**
