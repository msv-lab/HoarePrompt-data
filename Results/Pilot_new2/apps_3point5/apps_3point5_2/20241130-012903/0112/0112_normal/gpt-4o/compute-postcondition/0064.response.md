Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is n-1. If the cube at index `i` has not been used and the `digit` is in the faces of the cube at index `i`, then `found` is True and the program breaks out of the loop.**
