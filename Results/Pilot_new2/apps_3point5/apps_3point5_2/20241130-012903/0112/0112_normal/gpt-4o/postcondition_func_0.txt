The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and cubes. n is an integer between 1 and 3, while cubes is a list of n lists containing integers representing numbers on the faces of cubes. The function iterates through the cubes to create sets of unique faces. It then increments x by 3 until a condition defined in can_form_number function is met. The function returns the final value of x increased by 3.
