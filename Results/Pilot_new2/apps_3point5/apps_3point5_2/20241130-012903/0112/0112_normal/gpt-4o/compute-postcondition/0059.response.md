According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 1 and `used_cubes[i]` is True. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Increase `i` by 1: `i` becomes 2.
- Update `used_cubes[i]` to be False, indicating that the cube at index `i` has not been used: `used_cubes[i]` is now False.
- Ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to continue: `n` should be greater than 1.

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[i]` is False, and `n` must be greater than 1**
