According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a palindrome string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_palindrome` is True, and `i` is incremented by 1. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `s[i] != s[n - i - 1]` should not be met so that `is_palindrome` remains True.
State: **`s` is a palindrome string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is incremented by 1**
