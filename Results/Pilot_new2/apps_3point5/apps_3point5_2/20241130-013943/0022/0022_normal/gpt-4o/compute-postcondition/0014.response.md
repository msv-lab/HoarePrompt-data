Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` containing only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It iterates through the string comparing characters at symmetric positions. If all characters at symmetric positions are equal, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function covers both the case when the string is empty and when it has an odd or even length, accurately identifying palindrome strings. However, the function does not handle cases where the input string contains non-English letters or special characters. **
