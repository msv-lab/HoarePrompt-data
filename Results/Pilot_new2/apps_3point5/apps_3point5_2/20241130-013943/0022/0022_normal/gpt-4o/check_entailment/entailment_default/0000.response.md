Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to follow the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` iterates through the string comparing characters at symmetric positions. If all characters at symmetric positions are equal, it correctly returns True, indicating that the string is an "s-palindrome". The code handles both cases when the input string has an odd or even length, accurately identifying palindrome strings as per the given specifications. Additionally, the output hints do not mention any specific edge cases that the code does not cover, and the code seems to be handling the problem description correctly. Thus, the correctness of the code is **True**.
