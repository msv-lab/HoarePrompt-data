Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer input 'n' and calculates the remainder when divided by 10. It then checks if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, then it rounds down to the nearest integer ending with 0 by subtracting the remainder from 'n'. If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest integer ending with 0 by adding the difference of 10 and the remainder to 'n'. The program correctly implements the problem description for all cases. For example, for input 5, the nearest integers ending with 0 are 0 and 10, and the program outputs 0 which is a correct answer.
