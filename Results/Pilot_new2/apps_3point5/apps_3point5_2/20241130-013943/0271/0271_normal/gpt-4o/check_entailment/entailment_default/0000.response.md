Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly rounds the input number `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0, as described in the problem statement. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and then based on the value of the remainder, adjusts `n` to a number that is either lower than or equal to `n` if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, or higher than `n` if the remainder is greater than 5. This logic ensures that the final result is rounded to the nearest integer ending with 0. Additionally, the code handles all possible edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as when `n` is already ending with 0. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **True**.
