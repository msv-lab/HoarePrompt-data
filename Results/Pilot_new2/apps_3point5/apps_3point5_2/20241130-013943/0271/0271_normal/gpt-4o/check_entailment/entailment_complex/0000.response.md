Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes an input integer `n`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and then rounds `n` to the nearest integer that ends in 0. The program follows the logic described in the problem description where if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down, and if the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up.

The program handles all cases as described in the problem description and provides a correct answer for each input. Therefore, the correctness is true.
