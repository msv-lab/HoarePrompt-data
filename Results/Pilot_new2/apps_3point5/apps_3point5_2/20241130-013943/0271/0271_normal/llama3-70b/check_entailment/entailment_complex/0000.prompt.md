You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya has a non-negative integer n. He wants to round it to nearest integer, which ends up with 0. If n already ends up with 0, Vasya considers it already rounded.

For example, if n = 4722 answer is 4720. If n = 5 Vasya can round it to 0 or to 10. Both ways are correct.

For given n find out to which integer will Vasya round it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — number that Vasya has.


-----Output-----

Print result of rounding n. Pay attention that in some cases answer isn't unique. In that case print any correct answer.


-----Examples-----
Input
5

Output
0

Input
113

Output
110

Input
1000000000

Output
1000000000

Input
5432359

Output
5432360



-----Note-----

In the first example n = 5. Nearest integers, that ends up with zero are 0 and 10. Any of these answers is correct, so you can print 0 or 10.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n % 10 == 0) :
        print(n)
    else :
        if (n % 10 <= 5) :
            print(n - n % 10)
        else :
            print(n + (10 - n % 10))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and n is not divisible by 10. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, then n - n % 10 is calculated and printed. If n % 10 is larger than 5, the remainder of n divided by 10 is larger than 5.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, then the current value of n remains unchanged. If n is not divisible by 10, then depending on the value of n % 10, if it is less than or equal to 5, n is updated to n - n % 10. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the remainder of n divided by 10 is greater than 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and then based on the value of `n`, it performs specific calculations and prints a modified version of `n`. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
