Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, if n = 8, the code will output 10 instead of the correct answer of 10 being one of the possible answers. The code always rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10, even if rounding down would also be a valid answer. This discrepancy between the code's output and the problem description makes the code incorrect.
