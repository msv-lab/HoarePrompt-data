Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, then the current value of n remains unchanged. If n is not divisible by 10, then depending on the value of n % 10, if it is less than or equal to 5, n is updated to n - n % 10. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the remainder of n divided by 10 is greater than 5.***
