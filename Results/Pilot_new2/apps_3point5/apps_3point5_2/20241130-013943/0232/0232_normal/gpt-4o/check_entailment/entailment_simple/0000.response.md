Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the list of colors, keeping track of the counts of each color in the `current_counts` dictionary. It then checks if the counts of each color match the desired counts in the `desired_counts` dictionary. If all colors have the exact desired counts, it returns 'YES'. If no such interval is found, it returns 'NO'.

The program ensures that the interval selected has exactly the desired counts of each color, as required by the problem description. Hence, it is correct.
