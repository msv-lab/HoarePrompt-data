The `desired_counts` dictionary is created by zipping the range from 1 to `m` with the list `k`. The values of `k` are already specified such that their sum is between 1 and `n`, and `m` is an integer between 1 and 100.

Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`} to the values specified in the list `k`.**
