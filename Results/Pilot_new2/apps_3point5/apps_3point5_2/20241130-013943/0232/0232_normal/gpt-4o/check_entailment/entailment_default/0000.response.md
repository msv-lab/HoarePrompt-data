Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly initializes the dictionaries `desired_counts` and `current_counts`, then iterates through the list of colors updating the counts and comparing them to the desired counts. The function ensures that the counts are properly updated and accurately compares them to the desired counts. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the code follows the problem description accurately, by describing how the function checks if all color counts meet the desired counts and returns 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. No edge cases or scenarios where the code may fail to meet the requirements are identified.
