Output State: **The loop will continue executing until all color counts in `current_counts` are equal to the desired counts in `desired_counts`. If this condition is met, the program returns 'YES'. The count of each color in `current_counts` may have been increased or decreased based on the loop operations. The final values of `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, and `right+1` will depend on the operations performed in the loop.**
