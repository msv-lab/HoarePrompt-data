#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n. colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. k is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum(k) <= n.**
def func_1(n, m, colors, k):
    desired_counts = dict(zip(range(1, m + 1), k))
    current_counts = defaultdict(int)
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will continue executing until all color counts in `current_counts` are equal to the desired counts in `desired_counts`. If this condition is met, the program returns 'YES'. The count of each color in `current_counts` may have been increased or decreased based on the loop operations. The final values of `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, and `right+1` will depend on the operations performed in the loop.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It initializes two dictionaries `desired_counts` and `current_counts`, where `desired_counts` maps colors to their desired counts from list `k`. The function iterates through the list of colors, updating the count of each color in `current_counts`. It checks if all color counts in `current_counts` meet the desired counts in `desired_counts`. If any color count is less than its desired count, it returns 'YES'. If after the loop all counts match the desired counts, it returns 'NO'. The function ensures that the counts are properly updated and compares them to the desired counts accurately.
