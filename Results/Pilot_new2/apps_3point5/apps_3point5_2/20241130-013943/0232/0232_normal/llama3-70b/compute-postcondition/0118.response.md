Functionality: **The function reads input values for the number of Jedi Knights, the range of colors, the colors of Jedi Knights, and the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. It then calculates the total number of lightsabers needed based on certain constraints and relationships. Finally, it determines if the total number of lightsabers needed can be achieved and prints 'YES' if possible, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.**
