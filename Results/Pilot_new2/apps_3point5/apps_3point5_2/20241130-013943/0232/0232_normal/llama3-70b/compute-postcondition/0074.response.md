Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of each color has been decremented by 1, except for the color 'color' which is now 0 if color not in window_counts. Additionally, `i` is increased by 1, `j+1` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `j+1`, `found` is True, and `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`.***
