Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of three functions that work together to find the smallest possible initial integer n based on the provided input string and substring. The functions handle the generation of possible numbers, validation of candidate numbers, and finally, calculation of the smallest valid number. 
The code is well-annotated, and the functions are logically structured to follow the problem description. The code considers all possible cases of generating valid numbers and finding the smallest one that matches the criteria specified in the problem description. Since there are no obvious discrepancies between the problem description, code, and annotations, and the provided examples work correctly, the correctness of the code is confirmed.
