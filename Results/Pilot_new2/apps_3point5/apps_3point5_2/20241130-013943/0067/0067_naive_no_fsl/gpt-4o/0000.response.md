Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the input values. It then checks the conditions specified in the problem description to determine the result. The program correctly prints the result as "+", "-", or "?" based on the conditions. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description provided. 

For all possible input cases within the given constraints, the program will provide the correct output according to the problem requirements. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
