Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes in three non-negative integers x, y, and z as input and calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes Nauuo can receive based on the given conditions. It then checks these values to determine the result.

1. If the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, it prints '-'.
2. If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, it prints '+'.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?'.

The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases:
- If the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, the result is '-'. This is correctly handled by the code.
- If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, the result is '+'. This is also correctly handled by the code.
- If neither of the above conditions are met, the result is '?'. This is also accurately handled by the code.

Therefore, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct for all potential cases.
