Correctness: **True**

The annotated program takes the input according to the problem description, calculates the balance of the string `s`, and then based on the conditions specified in the problem description, it prints the correct output for each test case. The program correctly handles the case where there might be an infinite number of prefixes and prints -1 in that case. The program follows the logic described in the problem description and provides the expected output.
