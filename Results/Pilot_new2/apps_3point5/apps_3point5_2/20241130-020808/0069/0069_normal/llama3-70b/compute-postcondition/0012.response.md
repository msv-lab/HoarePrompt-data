Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x` are integers; `s` is assigned the input string; `cnt0`, `cnt1` are the counts of '0' and '1' in `s' respectively; `balance` is equal to `cnt0` - `cnt1` and balance is not equal to `x`, but ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0. The value printed is ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1), where balance is `cnt0` - `cnt1`.**
