According to the code, the loop will execute `T` times. At the end of the last iteration, the variables have the following values: `T`, `n+1`, `x`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `new_balance`, `n`, `x`, `s`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `T` needs to be decreased by 1. 
State: **`T-1`, `n+1`, `x`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `new_balance`, `n`, `x`, `s`**
