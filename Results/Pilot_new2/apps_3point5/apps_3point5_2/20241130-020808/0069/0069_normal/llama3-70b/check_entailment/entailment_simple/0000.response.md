Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description for all test cases. It correctly calculates the balance of the string `s`, and then determines the number of prefixes of the infinite string `t` with the desired balance `x`. 

When the balance of the string `s` is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`, which is the length of `s` plus an empty prefix. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it means there are an infinite number of prefixes, and it correctly prints `-1`. In all other cases, it calculates the number of prefixes required to reach the desired balance and prints that value.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
