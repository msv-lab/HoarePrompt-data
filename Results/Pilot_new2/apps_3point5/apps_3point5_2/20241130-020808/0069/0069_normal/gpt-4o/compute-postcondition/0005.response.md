According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `data` is a list of strings does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 0, and `results` is an empty list.
State: **`data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
