According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is the total number of elements in prefix_balances list. The condition for updating prefix_balances[i] states that if s[i - 1] is '0', then prefix_balances[i] should be equal to prefix_balances[i - 1] plus 1, otherwise it should be minus 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so i will be 3. To update prefix_balances[i], we need to check the value of s[2], based on which we will update prefix_balances[3] accordingly. 
State: **Output State: prefix_balances is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values, `i` is 3, `n` is the total number of elements in prefix_balances list, prefix_balances[3] is updated based on the value of s[2].**
