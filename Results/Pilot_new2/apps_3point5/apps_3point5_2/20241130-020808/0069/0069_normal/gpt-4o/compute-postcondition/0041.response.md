Output State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 3, `results` contains either -1 or 0 based on whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 0, `x` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 1, `s` is a string obtained from the value of `data` at index 2, `balance` is correctly calculated and remains 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values after the loop finishes execution. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1. Otherwise, `results` contains 0. The values of the variables are preserved, count variable has been appended to the results list. `T` remains greater than 0, `n` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 0**
