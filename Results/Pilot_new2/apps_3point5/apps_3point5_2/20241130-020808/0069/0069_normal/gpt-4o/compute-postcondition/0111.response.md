According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. After the loop executes, the `results` list will contain the count of how many times the conditions inside the loop's if statement were met for each iteration. So for the loop to be executed, the `results` list must have at least 1 element, and each element in the `results` list will represent the count of conditions met for each iteration.

State: **`results` list must have at least 1 element, each element in the `results` list will represent the count of conditions met for each iteration**
