Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ for each test case. It handles the case where there might be an infinite number of such prefixes by checking if the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the calculated balance of the string $s$ is divisible by the difference between the count of 0s and 1s in $s$. If it is divisible, then it prints -1 indicating an infinite number of prefixes. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the number of prefixes based on the formula provided in the problem description. The program iterates through all the test cases and handles each one correctly.
