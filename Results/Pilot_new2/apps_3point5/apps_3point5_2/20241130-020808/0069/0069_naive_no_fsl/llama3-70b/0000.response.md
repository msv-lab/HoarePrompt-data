Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, length of string $s$, and the desired balance.
2. It calculates the balance of the given string $s$ and compares it with the desired balance $x.
3. If the balance is equal to $x$, it prints $n + 1$ which represents the number of prefixes of $t$ with the desired balance.
4. If there is an infinite number of such prefixes, it prints -1 as required by the problem description.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes using the formula provided in the problem description and prints the result.
6. The program handles all the cases and outputs the correct result for each test case based on the given problem description.
