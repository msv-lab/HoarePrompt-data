Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly takes input n and k, then iterates through all integers from 1 to k to check if the remainders are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and prints "No" if a duplicate remainder is found. Otherwise, it prints "Yes". The implementation aligns with the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
