Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 

The provided program correctly checks if all the remainders of n modulo i from 1 to k are distinct. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it will always return 'No' since there can't be distinct remainders if k is greater than or equal to n. Then it iterates through the range from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n modulo i, and checks if this remainder has been seen before. If it has, it returns 'No', indicating that there are duplicate remainders. If all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'. 

The program covers all potential cases according to the problem description and returns the correct output for each case. The logic is sound and fulfills the requirements of the problem.
