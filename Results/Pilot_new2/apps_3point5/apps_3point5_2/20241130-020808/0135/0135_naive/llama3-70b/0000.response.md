Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers n and k as input. It then iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by each integer, and checks if the remainder has been seen before. If a remainder has been seen before, it immediately prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes" at the end of the loop.

The program follows the problem description accurately by checking if all remainders of n divided by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It correctly handles the case where the remainders are not distinct and prints "No" as required. The logic in the program is sound and works for all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
