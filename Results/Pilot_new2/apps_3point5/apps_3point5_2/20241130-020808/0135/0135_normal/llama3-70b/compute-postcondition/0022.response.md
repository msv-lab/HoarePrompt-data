Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. `i` is k. `seen` is a set containing all unique remainders from the division of n by each i from 1 to k. If any remainder is repeated in `seen`, the function has printed 'No' at some point during the loop execution. The program has printed 'Yes'**.
