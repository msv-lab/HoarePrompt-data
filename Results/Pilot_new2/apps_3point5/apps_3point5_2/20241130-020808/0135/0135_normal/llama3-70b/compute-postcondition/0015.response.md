According to the code, the loop will execute k times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. In the loop, `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration. 

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- `seen` needs to be updated to include the new `remainder` value after dividing `n+1` by 2.
- If the new `remainder` is already in `seen`, then 'No' will be printed.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing the values 0, `remainder`, new_remainder.**
