Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder is repeated. 
- If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
- This approach ensures that all the remainders are distinct, as the code checks for duplicates and prints 'No' if any duplicates are found. 
- Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
