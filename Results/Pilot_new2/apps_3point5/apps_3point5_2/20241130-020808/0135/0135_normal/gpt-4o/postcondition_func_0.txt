The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is found to be a duplicate within the set `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If no duplicates are found, the function returns 'Yes'. However, there seems to be a missing edge case in the annotations where if `k` is equal to 1, the function should return 'Yes' without entering the loop to avoid division by zero.
