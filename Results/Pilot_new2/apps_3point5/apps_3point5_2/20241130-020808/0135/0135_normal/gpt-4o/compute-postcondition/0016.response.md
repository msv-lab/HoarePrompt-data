Output State: **`n`, `k + 1` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k + 1` ≤ 10^18 and `k + 1` < `n`, `seen_remainders` contains the remainder of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` ≤ `k + 1` along with the new remainder value after adding the new remainder to the set and the new remainder value is not already in `seen_remainders`, `remainder` contains the new remainder value of `n` modulo `i` where `i` is the new value of `i` after the code execution.**
