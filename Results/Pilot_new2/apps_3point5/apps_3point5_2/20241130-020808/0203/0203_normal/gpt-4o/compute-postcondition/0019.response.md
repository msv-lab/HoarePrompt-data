According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both d_queue and r_queue are not empty. Right before the loop, the only states that need to be adjusted are the content of d_queue and r_queue to ensure they are not empty, as the loop will execute at least one time. 
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string. Ensure that d_queue and r_queue are not empty**
