Postcondition: ***n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, fractions is a non-empty string. The count of 'D' fractions in the string is depublicans and the count of non-'D' fractions is remocrats. If depublicans > remocrats, the program prints 'D'. If depublicans is less than or equal to remocrats, the program prints 'R'.***
