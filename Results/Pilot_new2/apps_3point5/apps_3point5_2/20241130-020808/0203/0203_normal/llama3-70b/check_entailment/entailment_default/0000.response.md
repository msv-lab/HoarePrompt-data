Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the number of employees `n` and their fractions.
- It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' characters in the input string.
- Finally, it determines the outcome of the vote based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' characters.
- The process described in the problem description is followed in the code, where employees take turns making statements and denying others the right to vote until only one employee remains eligible to vote.
- The code correctly outputs 'D' if the count of 'D' characters is greater than the count of 'R' characters and 'R' otherwise.

The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct in following the problem description for every potential case.
