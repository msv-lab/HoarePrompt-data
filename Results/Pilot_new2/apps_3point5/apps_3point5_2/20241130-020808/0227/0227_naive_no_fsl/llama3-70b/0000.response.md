Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It determines the minimum number of variables needed to perform the sequence of operations by checking if the consecutive elements in the sorted array 'a' follow the pattern a[i] = a[i-1]*2. If not, it increments the count of variables 'm'. The program then outputs the minimum number of variables 'm' or -1 if 'm' exceeds 23. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
