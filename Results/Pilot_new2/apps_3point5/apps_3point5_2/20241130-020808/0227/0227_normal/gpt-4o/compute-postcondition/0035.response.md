According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `assigned`. If `assigned` still has elements left, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, `assigned` is not empty with more elements, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `can_form` is True. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, `assigned` still has elements left, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `can_form` is True**
