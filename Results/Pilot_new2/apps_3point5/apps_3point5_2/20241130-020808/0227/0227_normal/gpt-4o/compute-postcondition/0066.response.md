The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a`, which is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). After executing the function body, the program returns the maximum number of times `can_form` was False. Here, `can_form` is True if the difference between a[n-1] and x is in the list a, where x is the last element of list a. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the maximum number of times `can_form` was False based on the given conditions.
