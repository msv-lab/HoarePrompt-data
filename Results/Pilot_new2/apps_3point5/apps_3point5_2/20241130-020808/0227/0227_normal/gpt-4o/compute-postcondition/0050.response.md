Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers with the last element added, `assigned` is not empty and contains the element `a[i]`, `m` is 3, `i` is 3, `x` is `a[i]`, `can_form` is True if a[i] - x is in assigned. Otherwise, no change in the variables.***
