Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It first sorts the input sequence `a`, then iterates through each element and checks if the difference between the current element and any previously assigned value is in the set of assigned values. If not, it increments the variable `m` representing the minimum number of variables required. This logic ensures that the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations is correctly calculated.

Additionally, the program handles all potential cases by checking each element of `a` and determining the minimum number of variables needed. The implementation provides the correct output for the given examples and should work for all valid inputs as well.
