Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of a, m, k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, m, k ≤ 1000. Therefore, the value of `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula. 
Output State: **n, m, k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, a, b are integers obtained from the input split, `a_floor` is equal to the remainder of (a - 1) divided by m plus 1, `a_block` is calculated as specified above.**
