Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment correctly based on the given inputs. It considers the time to move between blocks (15 seconds per block) and the time to move between floors within a block (5 seconds per floor). The calculations for `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` are accurate, and the determination of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` is correct. The code handles cases where Edward and Natasha are on different floors efficiently. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
