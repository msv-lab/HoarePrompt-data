Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and then calculating the maximum possible distance between them after one swap. The logic used to calculate the distance is correct as it considers all possible scenarios where the elements can be swapped to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
