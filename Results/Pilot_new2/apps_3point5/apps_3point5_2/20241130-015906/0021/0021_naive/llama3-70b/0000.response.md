Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the position of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. It then calculates the maximum possible distance by considering the distances between the minimum and maximum elements with and without a swap. The program calculates the correct maximum distance by considering all possible scenarios and outputs the correct result. The logic in the code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
