Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, which aligns with the problem description.
- It correctly calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list by finding their indices and taking the absolute difference minus 1.
- It also calculates the minimum distance between them as well.
- The code then prints the maximum of these two distances, which represents the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap.
- The code runs under the constraint that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.

The output hints also confirm that the code is functioning as expected and aligns with the problem description. There are no edge cases identified where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
