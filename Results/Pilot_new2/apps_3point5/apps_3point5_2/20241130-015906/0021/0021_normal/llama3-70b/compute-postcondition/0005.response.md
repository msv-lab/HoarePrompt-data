Output State: n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; list a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n after converting the input values to integers. pos1 is the index of the integer 1 in list a. posn is the index of the integer n in list a. max_dist is calculated as the maximum value between the absolute difference between pos1 and posn minus 1 and n - 2. min_dist is calculated as the minimum value between the absolute difference between pos1 and posn minus 1 and n - 2.
