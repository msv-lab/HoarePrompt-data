Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, calculates the minimum distance between them, and prints the maximum of these two distances. The function works under the constraint that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.**
