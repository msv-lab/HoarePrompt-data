The value of `dist2` is assigned the absolute value of the expression `(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The initial states of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, and `dist1` remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` to the input values obtained by splitting the input string; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in list `a`; `dist1` is the absolute value of 0 minus `max_pos`; `dist2` is the absolute value of `n - 1 - max_pos`**
