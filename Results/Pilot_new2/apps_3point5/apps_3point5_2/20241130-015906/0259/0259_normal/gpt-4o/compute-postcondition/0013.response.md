Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is equal to the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then the current value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0), then `wait_time` is set to 0. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and ((t - s_i) % d_i != 0), then `wait_time` is assigned the value `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the if condition `if (wait_time < min_wait_time)` is evaluated to true, the current value of `wait_time` is less than the current value of `min_wait_time`.***
