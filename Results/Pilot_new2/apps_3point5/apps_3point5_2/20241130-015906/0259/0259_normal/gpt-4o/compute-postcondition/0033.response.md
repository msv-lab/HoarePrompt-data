Postcondition: ***Output State: `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i` are increased by 1. `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t` based on the new `i`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i` are increased by 1, `wait_time` is 0. If `s_i` is less than `t` but `(t - s_i) % d_i != 0`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i` are increased by 1, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
