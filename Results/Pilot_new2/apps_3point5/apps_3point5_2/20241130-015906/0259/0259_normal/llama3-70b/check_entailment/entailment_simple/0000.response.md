Correctness: **True**

The program takes input for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. Then, it iterates through each bus route to calculate the time difference between the current time and the arrival time of the first bus of each route. It keeps track of the bus route with the smallest time difference and prints the corresponding route.

The program correctly determines the bus route that Serval will use based on the problem description. It calculates the time difference for each bus route and selects the one with the smallest time difference. It handles the case where multiple buses arrive at the same time by choosing any one of them as per the problem description.
