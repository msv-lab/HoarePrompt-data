According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the buses list has at least 1 bus route. At the beginning of the loop, the values of `i`, `s`, and `d` will be assigned based on the bus route being iterated. At the start of the loop, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity and `ans` is set to -1.

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `buses` list contains bus routes with arrival time `s_i` and interval `d_i` for each route, `s` and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input for the last iteration of the loop, `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0 (index of first bus route)**
