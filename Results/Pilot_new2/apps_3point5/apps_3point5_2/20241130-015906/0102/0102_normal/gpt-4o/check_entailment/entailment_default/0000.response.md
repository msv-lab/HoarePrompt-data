Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly defines a function `func_1` which accepts an integer `n` and returns the corresponding English word representation of that number. The function handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description:
- If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the word representation from the 'ones' list.
- If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the word representation from the 'teens' list.
- If n is between 10 and 99 and n % 10 equals 0, it returns the word representation from the 'tens' list.
- If n is between 10 and 99 and n % 10 does not equal 0, it returns the combination of the word representation from the 'tens' list and the word representation from the 'ones' list, separated by a hyphen.

The code seems to be handling all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the correctness is True.
