The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list of N integers where N is between 2 and 500. Each element of the list is an integer between 1 and 10^6. Additionally, the function accepts an integer `K` between 0 and 10^9. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted list of all divisors of `x` in reverse order. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of N integers `x` and an integer `K`, and return a sorted list of all divisors of `x` in reverse order.
