Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `A_i` are positive integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, `N` and `K` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `A` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `gcd` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list A, `max_divisor` is now equal to the maximum of the previous `max_divisor` and `i`, and the square root of `gcd` is at least 1. The current value of `i` is such that `gcd % i` equals 0. The condition `i * i != gcd` is true after entering the if statement. After executing the code, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.**
