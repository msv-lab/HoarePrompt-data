Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values for N, K, and the list of integers A. It then calculates the sum of all integers in A. It defines two helper functions, func_1 and func_2, to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of numbers and to find all the divisors of a number, respectively.

After calculating the gcd of the input list A and finding all the divisors of the sum of A, the program iterates through the divisors in descending order. For each divisor, it checks if that divisor can divide all elements of A after performing the operations within the constraints provided. If the divisor satisfies this condition, it prints the divisor as the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

Since the program follows the problem description and correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A, and all test cases pass as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.
