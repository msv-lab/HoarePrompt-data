Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program reads the input values for x and y, then calculates the absolute difference between the two values using the abs() function and prints the result. This logic is correct for all potential cases as it accurately determines the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The program correctly follows the problem description for every possible input combination within the specified constraints.
