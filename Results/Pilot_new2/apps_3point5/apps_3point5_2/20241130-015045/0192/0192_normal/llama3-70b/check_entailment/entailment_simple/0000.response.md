Correctness: **False**

The provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program should actually calculate the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting from the equilateral triangle of side length x.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
