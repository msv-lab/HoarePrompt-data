Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input of two integer values n and k.
2. It then checks if n is less than k, in which case it prints -1.
3. It then creates a sequence by iterating from 1 to k and adding each number to the sequence if n is greater than or equal to the current number.
4. If the length of the generated sequence is not equal to k, it prints -1.
5. Otherwise, it prints the sequence as space-separated integers.
6. The program handles the case where there is no possible sequence by printing -1.
7. The generated sequence is strictly increasing and the sum is equal to n, ensuring that the output meets the requirements of the problem description.
