The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if any of the parameters `n` or `k` do not meet the given constraints, the program returns -1.

In Case 2, the program returns a list 'sequence' where each element is d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, with all elements incremented by 1.
