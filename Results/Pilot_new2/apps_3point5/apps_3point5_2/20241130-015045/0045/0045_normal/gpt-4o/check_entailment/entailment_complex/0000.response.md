Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. It first checks if the minimum sum based on the sequence formula is greater than 'n', in which case it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the value of 'd', generates a sequence list based on the problem requirements, and returns it. The program creates a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers whose sum is equal to 'n' and has the maximum greatest common divisor as required by the problem description. It also handles the case where there is no possible sequence by outputting -1.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
