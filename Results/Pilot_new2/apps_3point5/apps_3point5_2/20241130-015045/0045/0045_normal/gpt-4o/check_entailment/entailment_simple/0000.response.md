Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It creates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers that sum up to n and have the maximal greatest common divisor. If the answer exists, it outputs the resulting sequence. If there is no possible sequence, it outputs -1. The program calculates the sequence based on the given constraints and conditions in the problem description.
