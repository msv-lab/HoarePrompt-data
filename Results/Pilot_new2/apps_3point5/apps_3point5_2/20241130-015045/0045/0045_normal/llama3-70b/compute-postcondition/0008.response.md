The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. After executing the function body, the program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k`, which is stored in variable `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k`.
