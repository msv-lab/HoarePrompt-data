Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive integers `n` and `k` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a key step in finding a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers that sum up to `n` and have the maximal greatest common divisor. The Euclidean algorithm ensures that the greatest common divisor is found correctly, which is essential for the program to meet the requirements of the problem description.
