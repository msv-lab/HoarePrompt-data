Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes an input of two positive integers `n` and `k`, then it generates a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers whose sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor is maximal. It does so by iteratively adding numbers from 1 to `k` to the sequence until the sum equals `n`. If the generated sequence is of length `k`, it prints the sequence, otherwise, it prints -1. The program follows the problem description accurately and there are no identified cases where it does not produce the expected output.
