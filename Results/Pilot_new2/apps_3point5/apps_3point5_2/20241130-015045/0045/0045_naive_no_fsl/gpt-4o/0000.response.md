Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input of two positive integers n and k, calculates the minimum sum that a sequence of k positive numbers can have, checks if it is greater than n. If it is greater, it returns -1, otherwise it calculates the quotient and remainder when n is divided by the minimum sum. It then constructs the sequence by multiplying the quotient with each element in the range of k and then distributes the remainder among the sequence to make it strictly increasing. The program then prints the resulting sequence. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and the examples provided, ensuring that the sequence is strictly increasing and the greatest common divisor is maximal.
