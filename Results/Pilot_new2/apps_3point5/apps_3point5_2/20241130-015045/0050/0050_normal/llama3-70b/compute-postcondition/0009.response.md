Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are all integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s_i` and `b_i` are integers indicating the price of shares such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list containing integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in descending order, `shares` is assigned the value of the integer division of r by s[i], `i` is 0. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then the current value of `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i`.**
