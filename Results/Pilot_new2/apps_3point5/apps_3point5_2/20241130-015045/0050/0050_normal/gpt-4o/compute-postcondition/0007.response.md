Postcondition: ***n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000. s_i and b_i are positive integers representing the price of shares, such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000. n, m, r are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. s is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input. b is a list containing integers obtained from splitting the input. min_buy_price is the minimum price among the prices in list s. max_sell_price is the maximum price among the prices in list b. The maximum price among the prices in list b is greater than the minimum price among the prices in list s.***
