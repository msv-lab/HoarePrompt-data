Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros and `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, `a` is less than `b` and the code prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and the code prints '>'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b` and a < b is true, then the current value of `a` is less than `b` and the code prints '<'. If a >= b, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` evaluates to False (a string '0'), then the current value of `a` becomes False. If `b` is 0, then the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
