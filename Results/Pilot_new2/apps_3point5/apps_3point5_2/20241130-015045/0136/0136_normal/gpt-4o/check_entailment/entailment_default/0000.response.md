Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases. It reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, removes any leading zeros, compares their lengths, and then compares the actual values of `a` and `b` to determine if `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to `b`. The code also handles cases where `a` or `b` evaluate to '0' correctly. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of what the code does, confirming that the code is correct.
