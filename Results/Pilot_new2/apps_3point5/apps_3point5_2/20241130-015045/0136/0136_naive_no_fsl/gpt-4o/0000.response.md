Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two integers a and b as strings and removes leading zeroes.
2. It then compares the lengths of a and b. If the lengths are not equal, it directly prints the corresponding symbol ("<" or ">").
3. If the lengths are equal, it compares the actual values of a and b as strings. If a is less than b, it prints "<", if a is greater than b, it prints ">", and if a is equal to b, it prints "=".
4. The program handles the case where both a and b are '0' by assigning '0' to them.
5. The program correctly handles the comparison of the numbers based on the problem description for all potential cases.
