The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function, it returns the value of `k` after it has been shifted left `n` times. Additionally, the MOD value is equal to 1000003. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, shift `k` left `n` times, and return the resulting value while adhering to the given constraints and MOD value. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k, shifts k left n times, and returns the resulting value. The MOD value is equal to 1000003.**
