#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the final value of `b` after all iterations, `b` is the final result of `a` modulo `b` after all iterations, and `b` is equal to 0
    return a
    #The program returns the final value of 'a' after all iterations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. It iterates over the value of `b`, updating the values of `a` and `b` accordingly until `b` becomes 0. Finally, the function returns the final value of `a` after all iterations. The function essentially implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

        #The program returns the value of k after it has been shifted left n times, where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The MOD value is equal to 1000003.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, MOD is equal to 1000003. The value of k is less than or equal to 1 shifted left by n.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is equal to the result of `(total_days - k) % MOD`, `denominator` is equal to `(denominator * total_days^k) % MOD`
    p_no_shared = numerator
    p_total = denominator
    p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
    A = p_shared
    B = p_total
    g = func_1(A, B)
    A //= g
    B //= g
    print(A % MOD, B % MOD)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k, shifts k left n times, and returns the resulting value. The MOD value is equal to 1000003. However, there is a missing functionality in the annotations regarding the calculation and printing of the values for A and B. These values are obtained based on the shared and total probabilities, and a function func_1 is used in this calculation. The missing logic here is related to the actual computation of A and B, and their proper handling.
