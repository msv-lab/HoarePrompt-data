Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly computes the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It calculates the numerator and denominator of the probability fraction using a loop and then reduces the fraction to its simplest form using the Euclidean algorithm. The output is then printed modulo 10^6 + 3. The code appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
