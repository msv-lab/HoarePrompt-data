Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending side lengths of the equilateral triangle. It then calculates the absolute difference between x and y and prints the result, which represents the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x.

For all given inputs in the examples provided, the program correctly calculates and prints the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle from side length x to side length y. Additionally, the program logic is simple and straightforward, directly addressing the problem description without the possibility of deviation. Hence, the program is correct.
