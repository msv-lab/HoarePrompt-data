Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided annotated program accurately implements the problem description. It reads two integer inputs x and y, calculates the difference between x and y, and then returns half of that difference rounded up. This aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description, where Memory needs to determine the minimum number of seconds required to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from an equilateral triangle of side length x by modifying the sides in a non-degenerate manner. The formula used in the program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to achieve the desired side length.
