The function func_1 does not have any specific preconditions and does not accept any parameters. It reads input data, removes leading zeros from two strings a and b, and then compares the lengths of a and b. If the length of a is less than the length of b, it prints '<'. If the length of a is equal to the length of b, it compares the values of a and b, printing '<' if a is less than b, '>' if a is greater than b, and '=' if a is equal to b. The function does not return any specific value.
