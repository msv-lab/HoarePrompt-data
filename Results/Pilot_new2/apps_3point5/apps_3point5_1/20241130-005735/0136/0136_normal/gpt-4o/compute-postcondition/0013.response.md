Output State: **`data` is a list containing the values entered as input and separated by spaces, `a` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed, `b` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. After not entering the if condition, the length of `a` is not less than the length of `b` and the current value of `b` does not result in a True evaluation when used in the `not` operation. After entering the if condition, the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`.**
