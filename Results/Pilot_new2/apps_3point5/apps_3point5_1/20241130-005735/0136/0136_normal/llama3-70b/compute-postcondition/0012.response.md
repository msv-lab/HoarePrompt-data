Functionality: **The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` with no leading zeroes. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The functionality does not cover cases where `a` and `b` have leading zeroes or if the inputs are not valid non-negative integers.**
