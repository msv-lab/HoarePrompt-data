Output State: **After the loop executes, the value of `shares` will be the total number of shares bought, `r` will be the remaining amount of money, and `i` will be equal to the number of iterations that the loop went through. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `b` will remain the same as their original values as they are not modified within the loop.**
