Postcondition: ***n, m, r are integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, and 1 <= r <= 1000. s_i and b_i are integers indicating the prices of buying and selling shares, respectively, such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000. n, m, and r are assigned values based on the input split using map and int functions. s is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers. b is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers. min_buy_price is the minimum value in the list `s`. max_sell_price is the maximum value in the list `b`. If max_sell_price <= min_buy_price, then r. Otherwise, `total_bourles` is printed which is the calculated value of `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` plus `remaining_bourles`. All other variables retain their values from before the code execution.***
