Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input values for the number of shares, buying prices, and selling prices. It then calculates the minimum buying price and the maximum selling price. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints the initial investment `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial investment, the remaining amount of money after buying those shares, and then calculates the total profit that can be obtained by selling the maximum number of shares at the maximum selling price. The program handles all the cases specified in the problem description and provides the correct output.
