Output State: **n, m, and r are integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, and 1 <= r <= 1000. s_i and b_i are integers indicating the prices of buying and selling shares, respectively, such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000. n, m, and r are assigned values based on the input split using map and int functions. s is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers. b is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers. min_buy_price is the minimum value in the list `s`.**
