Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly determines the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price. It then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial bourles, and calculates the remaining bourles after buying those shares. Finally, it calculates the total bourles after selling all the shares at the maximum sell price. This logic follows the problem description for every possible case and the provided examples, so the program is correct.
