Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the initial amount of bourles.
2. It correctly reads the prices of buying and selling shares and sorts them accordingly.
3. The program then iterates through the buying opportunities and buys as many shares as possible until the initial amount of bourles is exhausted.
4. After buying shares, it iterates through the selling opportunities and sells all the shares bought, maximizing the amount of bourles.
5. The final output is the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening, which is calculated correctly.

Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output, the correctness is True.
