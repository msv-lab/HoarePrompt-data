Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days and k people. It uses the formula for calculating the probability and then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form. The program also handles large numbers by taking the modulo 10^6 + 3. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases and inputs.
