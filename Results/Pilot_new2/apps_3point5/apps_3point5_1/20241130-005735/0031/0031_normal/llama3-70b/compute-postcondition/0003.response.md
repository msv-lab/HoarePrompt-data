According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `k` is given as an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that the loop can execute. Therefore, the state should be:
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, total_days = 2^n, numerator = 1, denominator = 1**
