According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days = 2^n`, `numerator = (total_days - i)`, `denominator = 2^n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `k+1`.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, total_days = 2^n, numerator = (total_days - (i+1)), denominator = 2^n**
