According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, k is less than or equal to 1 shifted left by n does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to k is at least 2. 
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, MOD is 1000003, k is at least 2, `total_days` is equal to 2^n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1**
