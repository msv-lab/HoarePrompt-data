Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland, as per the given input of n and k. The program computes the probability as an irreducible fraction and prints the values modulo 10^6 + 3, as required by the problem description. The functions func_1 and func_2 are used to calculate the GCD and perform the necessary calculations for finding the probability.

The program handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as when k is greater than 2^n or when k is less than or equal to 1. It correctly computes the probability using the factorial approach and ensures that the numerator and denominator are coprime before printing the final result.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
