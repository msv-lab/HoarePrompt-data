Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input. It calculates the minimum sum possible with the given `k` and then calculates the number of times this sum can be fit into `n` to get an initial value `d`. It then distributes the remainder of the division among the sequence to maximize the greatest common divisor.

The program ensures that the sum of the sequence is equal to `n`, the sequence is strictly increasing, and the greatest common divisor is maximal. If there is no possible sequence, it returns -1 as required.

The program follows the problem description accurately and generates the output sequence with the specified properties. Hence, the correctness is true.
