The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If the function executes and returns -1, it means that there is a specific condition where the program should return -1.

Case_2: If the function executes and returns a list 'sequence' containing values calculated as 'd' * (i + 1) for i in range(k), it means that for valid inputs of n and k, the program will generate a list 'sequence' with values calculated according to the given formula. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers n and k, where n and k are between 1 and 10^10. The function may return -1 under a specific condition, or it will return a list 'sequence' with values calculated based on the formula 'd' * (i + 1) for i in range(k).
