Postcondition: ***Output State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to k*(k + 1) // 2 and the calculated `min_sum` is less than or equal to n, d is equal to n divided by `min_sum`, remainder = n - d * `min_sum`, sequence is a list containing values calculated as d * (i + 1) for i in range(k), `i` starts at k - 1 and decrements down to 0. Additionally, the current value of remainder is 0***
