Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if the number n ends with 0, in which case it is already rounded. If not, it rounds n to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The program considers both cases where n % 10 is less than or equal to 5 and greater than 5, providing the correct answer for each scenario. The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the expected output for each one.
