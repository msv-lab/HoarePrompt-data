Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 10. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then the current value of `remainder` is less than or equal to 5. In this case, `result` is equal to the difference between n and remainder. If `remainder` is larger than 5, then `result` is equal to n + (10 - remainder).**
