Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a non-negative integer `n`, calculates the remainder when divided by 10, and then rounds `n` to the nearest integer ending in 0 based on the value of the remainder. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`, and if the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder. The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the rounding is done correctly.
