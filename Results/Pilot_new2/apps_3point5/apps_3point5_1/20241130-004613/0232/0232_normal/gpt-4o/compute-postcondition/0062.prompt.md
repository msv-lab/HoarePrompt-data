You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. k is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n.**
```
def func_1(n, m, colors, k):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns 'YES' if all current_counts for each color are equal to their respective desired_counts after the increment.

Case_2: The program returns 'YES' if the current count for at least one color is not equal to the desired count after decrement

Case_3: The program returns 'YES' and 'left' is increased by 2

Case_4: The program returns 'YES'. 'left' is increased by the total number of times the loop executed. 'right' is incremented by 1. The count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` is increased by 1. All colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`.

Case_5: The program returns 'YES' only when all colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`. If this condition is not met, the program increments `left` by the total number of times the loop executed plus 2, increments `right` by 1, increases the count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` by 1, and decreases the count of color `colors[left]` in `current_counts` by 1.

Case_6: The program returns 'YES' since at least one color in `current_counts` has a count less than the desired count in `desired_counts`

Case_7: The program returns 'YES', `left` is increased by the total number of times the loop executed + 1, `right` is incremented by 1, and the count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` is increased by 1

Case_8: The program does not return 'YES'

Case_9: The program returns 'YES'

Case_10: The program returns 'NO'

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
