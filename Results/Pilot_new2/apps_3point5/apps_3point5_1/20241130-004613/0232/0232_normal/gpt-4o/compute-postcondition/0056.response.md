Postcondition: ***All colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`, `left` is increased by the total number of times the loop executed + 3, `right` is incremented by 1, the count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` is increased by 1, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1. If all colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES'.***
