Output State: **The program returns 'YES' only when all colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`. If this condition is not met, the program increments `left` by the total number of times the loop executed plus 2, increments `right` by 1, increases the count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` by 1, and decreases the count of color `colors[left]` in `current_counts` by 1.**
