According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `right` is within the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES', `left` is increased by the total number of times the loop executed, `right` is incremented by 1, and the count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` is increased by 1. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **All colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`, program returns 'YES', `left` is increased by the total number of times the loop executed + 1, `right` is incremented by 1, the count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` is increased by 1**
