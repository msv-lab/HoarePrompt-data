Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for the number of colors of lightsabers, the list of colors, and the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. It then checks if there exists a contiguous subsequence of the colors list such that the counts of each color match the desired counts. If such a subsequence exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function ensures valid input parameters based on the constraints provided.**
