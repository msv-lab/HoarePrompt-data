Output State: **All variables (`n`, `m`, `colors`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `j`, `window_counts`) are incremented by 1. `window_counts` remains a dictionary with key `color` and value `2`. `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color` is not in `window_counts`, and `j` is less than `n. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.**
