Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, colors is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and must have at least 1 color, color is the first color in the list, counts is the list of integers obtained by splitting the input, color_counts is an empty dictionary. If color is not in color_counts, then the current state of the program retains all the aforementioned conditions, and color is not in color_counts.***
