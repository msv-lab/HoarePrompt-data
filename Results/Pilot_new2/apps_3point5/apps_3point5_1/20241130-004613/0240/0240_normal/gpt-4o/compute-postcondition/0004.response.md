Postcondition: ***`chars` is not an empty string, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the permutations of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` as a substring, and the yield statement has been executed, then the overall state remains the same as the precondition, with the addition that the current value of `candidate` has been yielded.***
