The function accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It calculates the difference in character frequencies between `s` and `sub`, then generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters in `s` after subtracting the characters in `sub`. Finally, it returns the smallest number from the generated possible numbers.
