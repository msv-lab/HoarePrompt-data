According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are permutations of `chars` left to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is not an empty string, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is a string formed by joining the permutations of `chars`. If the `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` as a substring and the `yield` statement has been executed, then the overall state remains the same as the precondition, with the addition that the current value of `candidate` has been yielded.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated. This means adjusting the state to reflect the next permutation that will be used in the next iteration.
State: **`chars` is not an empty string, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `candidate` is the next string formed by joining the next permutation of `chars`.**
