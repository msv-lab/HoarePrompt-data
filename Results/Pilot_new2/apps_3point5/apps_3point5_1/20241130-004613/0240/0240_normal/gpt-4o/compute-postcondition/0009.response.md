According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next string formed by joining the next permutation of `chars` and `candidate` is yielded if it is a valid number based on the given condition. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` should be generated to form the next `candidate`.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `candidate` is the next string formed by joining the next permutation of `chars`**
