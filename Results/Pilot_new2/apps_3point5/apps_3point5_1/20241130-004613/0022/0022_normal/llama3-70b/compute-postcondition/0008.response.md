According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`, which is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, and `i` is 0. 
To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s`, which is greater than or equal to 2; `is_spalindrome` is either True or False depending on the comparison of characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1`; `i` is 1**
