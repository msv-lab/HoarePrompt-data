Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines if a given string is an "s-palindrome" by checking if the first half of the string is equal to the reverse of the second half. The logic implemented in the function func_1 correctly handles the definition of an "s-palindrome" as described in the problem statement. The program then prints "TAK" if the string is an "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise. 

I have gone through the code and considered various potential cases, and it seems to correctly identify whether a string is an "s-palindrome" or not. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
