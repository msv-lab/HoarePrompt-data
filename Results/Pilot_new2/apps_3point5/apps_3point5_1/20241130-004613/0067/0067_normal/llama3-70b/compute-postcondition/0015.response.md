Postcondition: ***x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. x is less than or equal to y + z. x is greater than or equal to y. If x equals y, then depending on the value of z, the program will either keep z the same if z is 0 or update the value of z if z is not 0. If x is not equal to y, then the values of x, y, and z remain unchanged.***
