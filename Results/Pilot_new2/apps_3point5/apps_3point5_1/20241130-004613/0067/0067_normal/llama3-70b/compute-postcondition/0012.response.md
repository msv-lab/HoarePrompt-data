Postcondition: ***x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. x is less than or equal to y + z. x is greater than or equal to y. x is equal to y. If z == 0, then z remains 0 after the execution. If z is not equal to 0, then the value of z changes, but the rest of the conditions remain the same.***
