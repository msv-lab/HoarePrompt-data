Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by sorting the input sequence of integers in ascending order and then checking if each consecutive element is exactly twice the value of the previous element plus 1. If any element does not follow this pattern, it increments the variable `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1.

The program ensures that each operation assigns the correct value as described in the problem, and it calculates the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations. It covers all possible cases and provides the correct output according to the problem description.
