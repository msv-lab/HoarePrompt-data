Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description correctly. It sorts the list of distinct positive integers in ascending order, then iterates through the elements to check if each element can be formed by adding two elements from the list. If an element cannot be formed, it increments the count of variables required. Finally, it returns the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem. The logic of the program aligns with the requirements of the problem, making it correct.
