Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a. It sorts the list a in ascending order, iterates through the elements of a to determine if each element can be formed by adding two elements from the list, and counts the number of elements that cannot be formed in such a way. It then returns the count of elements that cannot be formed, represented by variable m.**
