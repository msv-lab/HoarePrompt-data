Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `assigned` is a set containing all elements of list `a` and is not empty, `m` is 3, `i` is the index of the last element in list `a`, `x` is the last element in the set `assigned`, `can_form` is True. The loop has executed and checked if a[i] - x exists in assigned for all elements in assigned. The current value of `can_form` is False***
