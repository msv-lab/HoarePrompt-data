Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers n and k as input and then iterates through all integers from 1 to k checking if the remainder of n divided by i is already in the 'seen' set. If it is, then it prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes".

The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all remainders are distinct and prints "No" if any remainder is repeated. It covers all potential cases and edge cases, ensuring that the output is correct for any valid input within the given constraints.
