Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes two integers n and k as input. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, and if so, it returns 'No', which is correct according to the problem description. Then, it initializes a set called seen_remainders to keep track of the remainders of n divided by i for all i between 1 and k. It then iterates over the range from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if this remainder is already in seen_remainders. If it is, it returns 'No', indicating that not all remainders are distinct. If no duplicate remainders are found, it adds the remainder to seen_remainders. Finally, if the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.

The program follows the problem description correctly by checking if all the remainders are distinct and returning the correct output accordingly for each case.
