According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n. Also, the remainder of n divided by i for some i has been added to seen_remainders. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`, so the updated state should be:
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainder of n divided by i for some i, i is between 1 and k inclusive**
