According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is less than or equal to n. Before the loop starts, k is less than n is ensured, but the set seen_remainders is empty. Hence, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, and seen_remainders is an empty set.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, seen_remainders is an empty set**
