Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n. seen_remainders is a set containing the remainder of n divided by i for some i, i is between 1 and k inclusive. remainder is the remainder of n divided by i. If remainder is in seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program variables.***
