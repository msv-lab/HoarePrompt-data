Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem description. The function considers the time taken for Edward to exit his apartment, the time taken to walk around the building in both directions, and the time taken to reach Natasha's floor. The implementation seems to correctly calculate the time based on the location of the apartments and the movements required. The logic for calculating the location of the apartments and the time taken for different movements appears to be in line with the problem description. Additionally, the program reads input from the user and outputs the correct result. Since the program seems to handle all cases according to the problem description, the correctness is deemed as True.
