Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block` remain the same. `min_block_time` is assigned the value of the minimum time between blocks, calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` and `n -` the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, multiplied by 15. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is assigned the value of `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `a_floor` is not greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is assigned the value of `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
