Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by calculating the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given rules of movement within the circular building. The program calculates the block time and floor time accurately and sums them to find the total minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. The logic in the program aligns with the rules described in the problem description for calculating the minimum time.

Therefore, the program is correct and outputs the expected results for all test cases.
