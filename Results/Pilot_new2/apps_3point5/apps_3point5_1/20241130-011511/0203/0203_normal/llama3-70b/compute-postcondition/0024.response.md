The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, we know that the function implicitly accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of employees. The input characters are either 'D' or 'R'.

The function does not have a specified return value in the given constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle and process the input characters 'D' and 'R' for the specified number of employees `n`.
