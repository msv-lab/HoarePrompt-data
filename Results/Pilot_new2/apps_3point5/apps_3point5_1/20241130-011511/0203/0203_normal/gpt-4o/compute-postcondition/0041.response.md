Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains the same as the original input integer between 1 and 200,000. `votes` still contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. `d_queue` is empty. `r_queue` contains the elements that were not processed. The final values of `d_index` and `r_index` are undetermined as no changes were made to them during the loop iterations.**
