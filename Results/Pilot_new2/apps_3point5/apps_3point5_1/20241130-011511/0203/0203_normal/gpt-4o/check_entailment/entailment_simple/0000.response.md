Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. It simulates the voting process by keeping two queues, one for 'D' employees and one for 'R' employees. It then iterates through the queues, updating the indices based on the order of voting. The final outcome is determined by checking which queue still has elements left.

The program ensures that each employee can only deny the right to vote to employees who have not voted yet. This follows the rules outlined in the problem description, where employees can only deny voting rights to those who have not made a statement yet.

Therefore, the program is correct and will always predict the outcome of the vote as described in the problem statement.
