According to the code, the loop can execute if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `r_index` needs to be updated to the current value of `d_index` after the modifications mentioned above.
- `d_index` needs to be updated based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet.
- If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, it needs to be adjusted to `r_index + n`.
- If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, a new element needs to be appended to `r_queue` which is the previous value of `r_index` plus `n`.
State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `r_index`, `d_index` and `r_queue` need to be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet**.
