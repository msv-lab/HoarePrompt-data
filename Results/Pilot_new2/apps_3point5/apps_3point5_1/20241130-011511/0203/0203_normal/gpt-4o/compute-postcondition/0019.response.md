According to the code, the loop will execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' elements in the `votes` list in the order they appeared, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all 'R' elements in the `votes` list in the order they appeared. 

For the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` must have elements in them. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `d_queue` and `r_queue` must have elements in them**
