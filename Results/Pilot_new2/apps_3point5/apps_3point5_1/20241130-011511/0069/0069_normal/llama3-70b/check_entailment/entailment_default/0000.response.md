Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values for the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case correctly.
- For each test case, it calculates the balance of the string `s` and compares it to the desired balance `x` as required by the problem description.
- If the balance is equal to `x`, it increments the count of prefixes by 1, which is correct.
- If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints -1, indicating an infinite number of prefixes, which is also correct.
- Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes based on the balance and correctly prints the result.
- The code covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each of them.
