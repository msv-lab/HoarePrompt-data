Postcondition: ***T must be a positive integer, n and x are integers, s is the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then n is incremented by 1. If balance is not equal to x and ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) == 0, no changes occur in the variables. If the condition is false, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is returned.***
