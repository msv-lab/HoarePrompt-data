Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input data for each test case.
- It calculates the balance of the string 's' and creates a list of prefix balances based on the occurrences of '0' and '1'.
- It then checks the conditions as described in the problem statement and appends the results accordingly.
- The code handles the case where the number of prefixes is infinite by checking if balance is equal to zero and if x is in the prefix balances.
- The logic of the code is in line with the problem description and all cases seem to be handled correctly.
