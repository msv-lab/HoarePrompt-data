Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1 where the ith element is the sum of the ith element in the previous list and 1 if s[i - 1] is equal to '0' and -1 otherwise. `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated according to the formula: `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`.**
