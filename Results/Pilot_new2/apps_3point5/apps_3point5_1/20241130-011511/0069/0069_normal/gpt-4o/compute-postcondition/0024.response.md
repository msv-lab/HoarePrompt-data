Postcondition: ***All variables maintain their original relationships and values, with `prefix_balances` being fully updated according to the provided code in the loop. If the balance is equal to 0, then the current value of the balance is 0. After the if-else block executes, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, the results list will have -1 appended to it. Otherwise, if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, the results list will have 0 appended to it.***
