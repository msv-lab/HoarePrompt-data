According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 3 and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1 where the ith element is the sum of the ith element in the previous list and 1 if s[i - 1] is equal to '0' and -1 otherwise, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated according to the provided formula**
