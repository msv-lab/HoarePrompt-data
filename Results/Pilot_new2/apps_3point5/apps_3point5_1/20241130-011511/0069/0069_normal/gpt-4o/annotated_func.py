    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1, where the ith element is the sum of the ith element in the previous list and 1 if s[i - 1] is equal to '0' and -1 otherwise. `n` is the length of the string `s`. If balance is 0, the current value of balance is 0. After the execution of the if else block, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains the value -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, a new element 0 is added to `results`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `prefix_balances` remains a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the total number of times the if condition was true during the loop execution. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `x` and `b` satisfy the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0). `results` has been appended with the value of `count`
    for result in results:
        print(result)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input data, processes it based on certain conditions, and prints results. It accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), x (an integer), and s (a binary string of length n). The function calculates balances, checks conditions, and appends results accordingly. The function does not have a specified return value. Missing functionality includes handling cases where certain conditions are not met based on the annotations.
