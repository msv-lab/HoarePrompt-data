Postcondition: ***After executing the if-else block, the balance is calculated based on the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 with at least one element, `i` is equal to `n`, the balance is not equal to 0, `count` equals 2 or 3, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, and the current value of `x` and `b` satisfy the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0).***
