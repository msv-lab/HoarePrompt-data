Postcondition: ***`balance` is calculated based on the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0, `i` is equal to `n`, the current value of `i` is equal to `n`. If `balance == 0`, after the if condition, the current value of `balance` is 0. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` list contains -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` list has a new element appended which is 0. If `balance` is not equal to 0, after the loop finishes executing, `balance` is still calculated based on the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 with at least one element, `i` is equal to `n`, `count` is the total number of times the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) was satisfied during the loop execution, and `results` contains the appended value of `count`.***
