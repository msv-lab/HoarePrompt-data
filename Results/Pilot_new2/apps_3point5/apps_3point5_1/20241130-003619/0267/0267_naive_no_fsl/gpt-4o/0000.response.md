Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k)`: Checks if the number `n` contains at most `k` different digits by converting it to a string and checking the length of the set of digits.
2. `func_2(l, r, k)`: Iterates through the numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and adds the numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits to the `total_sum`.

The program then reads input values for `l`, `r`, and `k`, calls `func_2` with these input values, and prints the result.

The implementation correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits as described in the problem statement. The program loops through the numbers within the range, checks if each number meets the condition, and adds it to the total sum accordingly. The final result is correctly printed after taking the modulo `998244353`.

Since the program follows the problem description and works as expected for all potential cases, the correctness is deemed True.
