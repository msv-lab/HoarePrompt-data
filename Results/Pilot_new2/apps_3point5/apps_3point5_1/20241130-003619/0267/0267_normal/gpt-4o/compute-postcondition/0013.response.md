The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the program returns the updated value of `total_sum` after adding all numbers from `l` to `r` where `func_1(num, k)` is true and taking the sum modulo `MOD`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` is true, and return the updated value of `total_sum` after taking the sum modulo `MOD`.
