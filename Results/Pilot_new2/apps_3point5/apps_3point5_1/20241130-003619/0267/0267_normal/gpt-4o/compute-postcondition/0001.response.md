According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `l` and `r` are within the specified range. The loop will iterate from `l` to `r` (inclusive). Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0**
