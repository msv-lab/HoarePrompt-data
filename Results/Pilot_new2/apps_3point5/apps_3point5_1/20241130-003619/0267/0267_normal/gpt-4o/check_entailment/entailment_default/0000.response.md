Based on the code provided and the problem description, let's analyze the correctness of the program:

1. Function `func_1`: This function checks if the number of unique digits in the integer 'n' is less than or equal to the integer 'k'. The code accurately checks if the number of unique digits in 'n' is less than or equal to 'k' and returns True in that case. However, it does not handle cases where 'n' has more unique digits than 'k', which should result in returning False. This function may produce incorrect results when 'n' has more unique digits than 'k'.

2. Function `func_2`: This function iterates over numbers from `l` to `r`, calculates the total sum of numbers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` is true, and returns the updated value of `total_sum` after taking the sum modulo `MOD`. The function seems to follow the problem description, but due to the issue in `func_1`, it may not handle cases where 'n' has more unique digits than 'k' correctly.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

An example of a case where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
10 15 1

Output:
Should be 66 (10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15), but the program might include numbers with more than 1 unique digit due to the issue in `func_1`.
