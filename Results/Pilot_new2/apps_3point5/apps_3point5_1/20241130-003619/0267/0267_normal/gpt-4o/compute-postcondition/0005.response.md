According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `num` in the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l`, `r`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= `l` <= 10^18, `l` <= `r` <= 10^18, and 1 <= `k` <= 10 respectively. Also, `total_sum` has been updated by adding the value returned by `func_1(num, k)` modulo MOD to the previous `total_sum`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `num` needs to be considered. Since the loop iterates from `l` to `r` inclusively, the next value of `num` will be the current value of `num` plus 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are as follows:
State: **`l`, `r`, and `k` remain the same, `total_sum` is updated according to the value returned by `func_1(num + 1, k) modulo MOD**
