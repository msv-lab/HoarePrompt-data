According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is within the range of 1 to k. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary, k is not equal to 0, (n, k) is not in dp, n is greater than or equal to 10^k, dp[n, k] is equal to 9, i is 1**
