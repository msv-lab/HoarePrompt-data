Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. It follows the problem description by using dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in a given range. The main function `func_1` then calculates the desired sum by taking the difference of counts for $r$ and $l-1$.

The program handles all potential cases where $l$, $r$, and $k$ satisfy the given constraints, and it returns the correct result modulo $998244353$ as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
