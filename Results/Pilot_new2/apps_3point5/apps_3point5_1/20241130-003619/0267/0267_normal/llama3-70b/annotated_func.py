#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It calculates the result of (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD, where l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is an empty dictionary. The function does not define the `count` function or the value of `MOD`, so its actual functionality is dependent on the implementation of these missing components.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. Parameters `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, while `dp` is a dictionary. The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- Case 1: The function returns 0.
- Case 2: The function returns the value stored in the dictionary `dp` at key (n, k) if it exists.
- Case 3: The function returns the value stored in the dictionary `dp` at key (n, k), which is calculated based on certain conditions initially specified in the code. 
The code initializes values in the dictionary `dp` based on the values of `n` and `k`, incrementing and modifying accordingly. If the key (n, k) does not exist in the dictionary, the code calculates the value and stores it in `dp`.
