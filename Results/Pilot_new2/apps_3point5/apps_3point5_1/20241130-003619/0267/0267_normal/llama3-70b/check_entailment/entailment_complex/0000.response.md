Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the code and the problem description, the code implements the required functionality correctly. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits as described in the problem. It calls the `count` function to handle the calculation of the partial sums based on different conditions. The `count` function appropriately calculates and stores the required values in the dictionary `dp` to optimize the computation process. The code logic aligns with the problem description and the provided examples, ensuring that the correct output is generated for the given inputs. Since there are no identified discrepancies or cases where the code does not follow the problem description, the correctness of the code is considered true.
