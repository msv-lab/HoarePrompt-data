Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. It checks if the difference between Vasya's favorite number and the first element of the sequence is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements and if the result is non-negative. If these conditions are met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". The logic implemented in the code covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description, making it correct.
