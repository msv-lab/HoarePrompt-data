The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input arguments. The function returns the sum of integers a, b, and c after squaring each of them. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to compute the sum of the squares of integers a, b, and c. 
Functionality: **The function computes the sum of the squares of integers a, b, and c.**
