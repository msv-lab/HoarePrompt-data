Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately follows the problem description. It reads three integers a, b, and c from the input, then checks if b is equal to a and prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it checks if c is equal to 0 and prints 'NO'. Lastly, if c is not 0, it verifies if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result of the division is non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and outputs the correct results in each case. Therefore, the program meets the requirements set by the problem description.
