Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True, `found` is either True if a match was found in any iteration or False if no match was found, there are no more digits left in the `digits` list. If `found` is still False at this point***
