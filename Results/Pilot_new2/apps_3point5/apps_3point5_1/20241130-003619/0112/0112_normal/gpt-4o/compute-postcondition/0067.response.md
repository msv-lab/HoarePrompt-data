Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing at least one more digit, `used_cubes` is a list where all elements are True, `found` is True, there are no more digits left in the `digits` list, `i` is equal to n-1, `n` is the total number of iterations that occurred, the current value of `used_cubes` satisfies the conditions of the loop, and the loop has finished executing, and found is False***
