Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. The function `can_form_number` iterates through the digits of the number and checks if each digit can be formed using the faces of the cubes. However, the code does not consider the restriction that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice versa using cube rotations. This means that the code may give incorrect results in cases where the digits 6 and 9 are involved.
