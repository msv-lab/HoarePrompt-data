The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `cubes`. It creates a list of sets, where each set contains the unique elements of each cube in `cubes`. It then iterates through increasing values of `x` until the function `can_form_number(x + 1)` evaluates to False, and returns the maximum value of `x` at that point.
