Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions. The first function, `func_1`, calculates the maximum number `x` that Masha can form using her cubes to create numbers from 1 to `x`. It does this by incrementing `x` until the function `can_form_number(x + 1)` returns False. The second function, `can_form_number`, checks if a given number can be formed using the faces of the cubes Masha has by iterating over each digit in the number and checking if it exists on any cube face. If a digit cannot be formed using the cubes, the function returns False, indicating that the number cannot be formed.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly determining the maximum number that Masha can form using her cubes. It ensures that leading zeros are not considered and that each digit in the number can be formed using the available cubes. The program follows the problem description and correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.
