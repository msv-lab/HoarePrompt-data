    while can_form_number(x + 1):

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Each set in `cube_faces` represents the unique elements of each cube in `cubes`; `x` is adjusted to the maximum value such that `can_form_number(x + 1)` evaluates to False
    return x
    #The program returns the maximum value of 'x' such that 'can_form_number(x + 1)' evaluates to False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `cubes`. It creates a list of sets, where each set contains the unique elements of each cube in `cubes`. It then iterates through increasing values of `x` until the function `can_form_number(x + 1)` evaluates to False, and returns the maximum value of `x` at that point.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha got for her birthday. Each cube has 6 faces with a single digit from 0 to 9 on each face.**

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: At the end of the loop, `num` is still a positive integer, `digits` is an empty list, all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True, `found` is either True if a match was found in any iteration or False if no match was found, `i` is equal to n-1, `n` is the total number of iterations that occurred, and the loop has finished executing.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num`, representing the number of cubes Masha received for her birthday. Each cube has 6 faces with a single digit from 0 to 9. The function iterates through the digits of `num` and checks if each digit can be formed using the faces of the cubes. If a match is found for each digit, the function returns True. If no match is found for a digit in any iteration, the function returns False.
