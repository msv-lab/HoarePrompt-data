According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all the other variables are in a valid state as mentioned. To ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing at least one more digit, all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True, `found` is False, there are more digits left in the `digits` list, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
