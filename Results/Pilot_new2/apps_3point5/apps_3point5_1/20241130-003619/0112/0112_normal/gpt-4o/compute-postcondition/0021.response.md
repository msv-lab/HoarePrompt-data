Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to True, `found` is True. The loop will execute for all n elements in `digits`, ensuring all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True after the loop finishes. If `found` is still False after the loop, then `found` remains False.***
