Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to True, `found` is True. If `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
