According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more digits left in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, there are no more digits left in the `digits` list. To execute the loop one more time, the `digits` list must contain at least one more digit and the corresponding `digit` variable must be set to that digit. Additionally, `found` should be set to False to indicate that no match has been found yet in the next iteration.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing at least one more digit, all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True, `found` is False, there are more digits left in the `digits` list**
