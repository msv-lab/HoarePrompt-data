According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of `char` in the string `s`. Right before the loop, `s` contains the final string after all replacements have been made, `alphabet` still has characters left to iterate over, `res` contains the characters of all `char` appended to it during each iteration, and `char` is no longer present in the final `s` string. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `char` is present in the final `s` string.
State: **`s` contains the final string after all replacements have been made, `alphabet` still has characters left to iterate over, `res` contains the characters of all `char` appended to it during each iteration, and `char` is present in the final `s` string**
