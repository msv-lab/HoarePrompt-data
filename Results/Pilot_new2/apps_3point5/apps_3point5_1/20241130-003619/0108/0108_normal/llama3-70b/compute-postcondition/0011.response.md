Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `char` to the `res` variable. The `res` variable already contains the characters of `char` appended to it, so after the execution of the code, `res` will have double the characters of `char`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`s` contains the updated string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` contains double the characters of `char`, `char` is still present in the updated `s` string**
