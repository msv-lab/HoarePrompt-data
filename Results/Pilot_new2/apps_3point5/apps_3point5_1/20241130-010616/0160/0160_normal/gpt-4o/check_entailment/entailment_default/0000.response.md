Based on the code and the provided problem description, let's assess the correctness of the program:

1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of a list of integers using the `math.gcd` function. This function seems to be in line with the problem description and should work correctly.

2. The `func_2` function calculates all the divisors of a given number `x` and then iterates over these divisors to check if each divisor can divide every element in the list `A` after some operations. The code also accounts for the maximum allowed operations `K`. This function appears to follow the problem description as it finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A` after the operations.

Overall, based on the code and the problem description, the program seems to be correct. The output hints also align with the code logic, reinforcing the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **True**
