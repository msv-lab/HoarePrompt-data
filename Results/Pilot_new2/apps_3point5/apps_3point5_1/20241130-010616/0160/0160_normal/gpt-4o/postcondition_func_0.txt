Functionality: The function func_1 accepts a list of integers 'lst' and calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list. The function iterates through the elements in the list using a for loop, updating the gcd_result by finding the greatest common divisor with each element. The final result returned is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list. The function assumes that the list 'lst' has at least 2 elements.
