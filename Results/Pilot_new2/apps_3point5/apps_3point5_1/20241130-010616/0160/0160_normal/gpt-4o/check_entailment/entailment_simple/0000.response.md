Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions. 

Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in a list. This is relevant to the problem description because the maximum positive integer that divides every element of the list `A` after the operations should be the GCD of all the elements in the list. The function correctly calculates the GCD of the elements in the list.

Function 2 (`func_2`) calculates all the divisors of a given integer `x`. This is relevant because the program needs to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A`. The function correctly calculates the divisors of `x` and returns them in reverse order.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality.
