Output State: N, K, A_i, gcd remain unchanged. 

`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`, where `i` is the value in the range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1 such that `gcd` is divisible by `i` and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.
