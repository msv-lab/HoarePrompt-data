Postcondition: ***N, K, A_i, gcd, max_divisor are integers. If gcd % i == 0 where i * i is not equal to gcd, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`, where `i` is in the range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1 such that `gcd` is divisible by `i` and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.***
