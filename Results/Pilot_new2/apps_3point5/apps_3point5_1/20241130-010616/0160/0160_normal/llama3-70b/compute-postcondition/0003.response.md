According to the code, the loop will execute as long as N is greater than 1. The loop index `i` starts from 1 and goes up to N-1. So, for the loop to execute, N must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `gcd` is equal to the first element of the list A and the loop index `i` is 1.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, N and K have been assigned values from the input split operation, gcd is equal to the first element of the list A, `i` is 1, N must be greater than 1**
