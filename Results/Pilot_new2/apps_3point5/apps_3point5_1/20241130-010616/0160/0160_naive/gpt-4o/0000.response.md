Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values N, K, and the list A.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A.
3. The function `func_2` correctly calculates all the divisors of the sum of elements in list A.
4. The program then iterates through the divisors and checks if each divisor can divide every element in A after the operations based on the given conditions.
5. If a divisor is found that satisfies the conditions for all elements in A, it is printed as the output.
6. The program correctly handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description.

Since the program covers all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
