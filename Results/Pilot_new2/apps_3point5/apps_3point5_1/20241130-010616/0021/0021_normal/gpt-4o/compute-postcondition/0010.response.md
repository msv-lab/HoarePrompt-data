The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to output the number of inversions in the array `a`. An inversion occurs in an array when there are two indices i and j such that i < j but a[i] > a[j]. The function should calculate and return the total number of inversions in the array `a`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns the total number of inversions in the array `a`, where an inversion occurs when there are two indices i and j such that i < j but a[i] > a[j].**
