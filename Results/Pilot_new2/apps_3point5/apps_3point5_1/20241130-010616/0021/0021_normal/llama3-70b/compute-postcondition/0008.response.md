Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, then reads a list of integers separated by spaces. It calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 1 and `n`, as well as the minimum distance. It then prints the maximum value between the maximum distance and `n - 1` minus the minimum distance. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
