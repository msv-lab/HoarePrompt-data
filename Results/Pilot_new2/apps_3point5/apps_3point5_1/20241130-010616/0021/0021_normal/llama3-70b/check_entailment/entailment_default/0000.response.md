Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from the input, then reads a list of integers separated by spaces. It correctly calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 1 and `n`, as well as the minimum distance. Finally, it prints the maximum value between the maximum distance and `n - 1` minus the minimum distance, which aligns with the problem description. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. The output hints also accurately describe the functionality of the code.
