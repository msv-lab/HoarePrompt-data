Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculating the distances from the ends of the array. It then determines the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap and prints the result. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases.
