Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum positions in the array, then calculates the distance between the minimum and maximum elements for all possible swaps. It then finds the maximum distance and prints it, which aligns with the problem description. The logic implemented in the program ensures that the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap is achieved. 
There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to deliver the expected output based on the problem description.
