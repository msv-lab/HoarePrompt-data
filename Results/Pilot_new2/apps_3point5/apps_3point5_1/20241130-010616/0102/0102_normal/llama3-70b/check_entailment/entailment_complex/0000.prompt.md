You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

You can find all you need to know about English numerals in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition
**s is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99.**
def func():
    ones = ['', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight',
    'nine']
    teens = ['ten', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', '', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    s = int(input())
    if (s < 10) :
        print(ones[s])
    else :
        if (s < 20) :
            print(teens[s - 10])
        else :
            print(tens[s // 10] + ('' if s % 10 == 0 else '-' + ones[s % 10]))
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 10 <= s <= 99, `ones` is a list containing strings from 'one' to 'nine', `teens` is a list containing strings from 'ten' to 'nineteen', `tens` is a list containing strings '' (empty string), '', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety. If s < 20, the value at the index s-10 in the list `teens` is printed. If s >= 20, the result is the string representation of the number `s` in words.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, `ones` is a list containing strings from 'one' to 'nine', `teens` is a list containing strings from 'ten' to 'nineteen', `tens` is a list containing strings '' (empty string), '', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety. After the execution of the if else block, if `s` is less than 10, the output is the string representation of the integer `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the output is the string at the index `s-10` from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output is the string representation of the number `s` in words.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `s` from the user input and converts it to its word representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word representation from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word representation from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the word representation by combining the words from the `tens` and `ones` lists. The function covers the conversion of integers to words from 0 to 99.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
