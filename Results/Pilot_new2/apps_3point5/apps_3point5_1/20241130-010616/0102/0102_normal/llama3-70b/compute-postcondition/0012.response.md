Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99, `ones` is a list containing strings from 'one' to 'nine', `teens` is a list containing strings from 'ten' to 'nineteen', `tens` is a list containing strings '' (empty string), '', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety. After the execution of the if else block, if `s` is less than 10, the output is the string representation of the integer `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the output is the string at the index `s-10` from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output is the string representation of the number `s` in words.***
