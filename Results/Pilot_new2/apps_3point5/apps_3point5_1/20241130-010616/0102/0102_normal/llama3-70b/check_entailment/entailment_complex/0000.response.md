Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly takes an integer input between 0 and 99, converts it into its word representation, and prints it in lowercase letters with hyphens instead of spaces. The program uses predefined lists to map the integer values to their corresponding word representations and follows the guidelines provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
