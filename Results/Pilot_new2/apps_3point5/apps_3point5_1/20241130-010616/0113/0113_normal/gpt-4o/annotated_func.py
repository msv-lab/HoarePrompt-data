#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns a positive integer x, which is the result of n multiplied by 10^k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10^k
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two positive integers, n and k, where n is in the range [1, 10^9] and k is in the range [0, 8]. It calculates a positive integer x by multiplying n with 10^k and dividing by the greatest common divisor of n and 10^k. The function then returns this result x.
