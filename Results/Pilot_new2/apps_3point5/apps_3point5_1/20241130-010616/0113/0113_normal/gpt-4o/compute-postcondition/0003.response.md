The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the program returns a positive integer `x`, which is the result of n multiplied by 10^k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10^k. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return a positive integer `x` calculated as described. 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, both positive integers. It returns a positive integer x, which is the result of n multiplied by 10^k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10^k.**
