Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, parses it, and then calculates the waiting time for each bus route based on the time Serval goes to the station. It then determines the bus route with the minimum waiting time and returns the chosen route correctly. The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly handles the scenarios where Serval arrives before the first bus of a route, when Serval arrives at the same time as a bus, and when Serval arrives after the first bus of a route. Since the code functions correctly for all possible inputs, we can conclude that the correctness of the program is **True**.
