According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If there are still tuples left in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows: `n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least 2 tuples, `_` is `n-1`, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from the second tuple in the `buses` list, `min_time` is equal to the current value of `time`, `ans` is `i + 1`, `i` is 1, `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least 3 tuples, `_` is `n-1`, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from the third tuple in the `buses` list, `min_time` is equal to the current value of `time`, `ans` is `i + 1`, `i` is 2, `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`**
