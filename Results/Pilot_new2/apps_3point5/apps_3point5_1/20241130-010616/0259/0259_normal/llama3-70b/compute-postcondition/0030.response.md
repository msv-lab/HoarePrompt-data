Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, the variables will have the following values: `n` remains at least 1, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains all `n` tuples, `_` remains `n-1`, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from the last tuple in the `buses` list, `min_time` contains the minimum value of `(t - s) % d` across all tuples in `buses`, `ans` is the index of the tuple in `buses` that resulted in the minimum `time`. If there are multiple tuples that result in the same minimum `time`, `ans` will hold the index of the first occurrence.**
