Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` that were appended, `_` is 1, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from the input split**. (Note: The values of `s` and `d` are updated based on the input split and appended to the `buses` list.)
