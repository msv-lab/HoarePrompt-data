Functionality: **The function `func` reads input data regarding bus routes, calculates the next bus arrival time for each route based on a given time, and prints the index of the bus route with the minimum waiting time for the next bus arrival. The function takes into account the constraints on input values and handles multiple buses potentially having the same minimum waiting time.**
