Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `_` is `n-1`, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from the first tuple in the `buses` list, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `time` is (t - s) % d. The current value of `time` is less than `min_time`***
