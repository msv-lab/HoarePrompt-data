According to the code, the loop can execute `n` times where `n` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` that were appended, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `_` increments by 1 and any other necessary adjustments are made to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` that were appended, `_` is 2**
