Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and if (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, then the `wait_time` is 0. If the condition is not met, the `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The current value of `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.***
