Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of that route. The function iterates through each bus route to calculate the minimum wait time based on the arrival time and interval. It then returns the route number (index + 1) with the minimum wait time. If there are multiple routes with the same minimum wait time, it returns the first encountered route.**
