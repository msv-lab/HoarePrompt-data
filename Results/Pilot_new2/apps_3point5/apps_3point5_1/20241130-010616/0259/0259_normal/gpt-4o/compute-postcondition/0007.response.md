Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`. Additionally, for the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, `s_i` is less than t. The current value of `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the current value of `(t - s_i) % d_i` is 0.***
