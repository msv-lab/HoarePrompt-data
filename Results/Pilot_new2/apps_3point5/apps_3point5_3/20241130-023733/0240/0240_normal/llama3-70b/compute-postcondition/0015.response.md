The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, where both `s` and `t` are strings. After executing the function body, the program returns an integer value `n` which is calculated as the number of characters from string `t` that are present in string `s`. This integer value `n` is then concatenated with the string `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, calculate the number of characters from `t` that are present in `s`, and return the concatenated string of `n` with `t`.
