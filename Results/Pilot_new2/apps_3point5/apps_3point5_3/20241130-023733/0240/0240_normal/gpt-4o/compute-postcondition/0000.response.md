According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations of the `chars` variable. If there are permutations available for `chars`, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state must be adjusted so that `chars` has at least one permutation. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`chars` has at least 1 permutation**
