Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies the smallest possible initial integer n that Vasya could pass to Kate based on the given inputs. The program generates all possible permutations of the remaining characters after removing the remembered substring and then finds the smallest number from those permutations. The logic implemented in the program covers all possible cases and provides the correct output.
