Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the integers obtained from the input split. `min_upvotes` is equal to the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. Additionally, `max_upvotes` is not less than `min_downvotes`, implying that the range of upvotes does not fall below the range of downvotes. At this point in the program, `(max_downvotes < min_upvotes)`.***
