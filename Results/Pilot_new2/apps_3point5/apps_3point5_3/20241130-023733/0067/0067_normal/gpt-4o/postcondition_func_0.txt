The function `func` takes no parameters. It reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from input, calculates `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` based on these values, and then determines whether to print '-', '+', or '?' based on certain conditions. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. The function does not return any value and only prints the result.
