Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from input, calculates `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` based on these values, and then determines whether to print '-', '+', or '?' based on certain conditions. The conditions for determining the output ('-', '+', or '?') align with the requirements specified in the problem description. Additionally, all the provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
