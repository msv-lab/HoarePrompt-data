Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the input values. Then, it checks if the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, in which case it prints "-". If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, it prints "+". Otherwise, it prints "?" to indicate uncertainty.

The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and outputs the correct result for each case. It correctly determines whether the result is certain or uncertain based on the input values of x, y, and z.
