Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. `x`, `y`, `z` are assigned values parsed from input. `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. If `x` is equal to `y`, after executing the code, if `z` is 0, `x` remains equal to `y` and `z` is set to 0. If `z` is not 0, `x` remains equal to `y` and `z` remains unchanged.***
