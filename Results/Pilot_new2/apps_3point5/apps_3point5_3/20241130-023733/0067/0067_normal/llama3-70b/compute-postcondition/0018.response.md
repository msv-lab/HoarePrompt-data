The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input arguments. The function should return the sum of the integers x, y, and z, where x, y, and z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the sum of three integers x, y, and z within the range of 0 to 100.
