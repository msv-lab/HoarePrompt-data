Postcondition: ***x, y, z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. x, y, z are assigned values parsed from input split by space. x is less than or equal to y + z. In the current state, x is equal to y. If z == 0, after executing the code, x is still equal to y and z is equal to 0. If z is not equal to 0, x is still equal to y but z remains unchanged.***
