Output State: **x, y, z are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. x, y, z are assigned values parsed from input split by space. x is less than or equal to y + z. In the current state, x is equal to y. After executing the code, x is still equal to y, z is equal to 0, and the current value of z is 0.**
