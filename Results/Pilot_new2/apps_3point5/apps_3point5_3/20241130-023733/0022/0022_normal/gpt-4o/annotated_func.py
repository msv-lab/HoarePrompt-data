#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length at least 1 and at most 1000, consisting of only English letters.**
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: s is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), consisting of only English letters; n is the length of s and n is at least 2. If s is not a palindrome, the program returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True as the input string 's' is a palindrome consisting of only English letters
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length at least 1 and at most 1000, consisting of only English letters. The function iterates through the string to check if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). If `s` is a palindrome, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
