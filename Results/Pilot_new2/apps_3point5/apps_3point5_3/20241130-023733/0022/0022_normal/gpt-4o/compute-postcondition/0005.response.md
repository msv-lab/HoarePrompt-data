According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s` and n is at least 2. In the case where (s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]) is false, the characters at positions i and n - 1 - i in the string s are equal. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **s is a string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, consisting of only English letters; n is the length of s and n is at least 2. In the case where (s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]) is false, the characters at positions i and n - 1 - i in the string s are equal, i is incremented by 1**
