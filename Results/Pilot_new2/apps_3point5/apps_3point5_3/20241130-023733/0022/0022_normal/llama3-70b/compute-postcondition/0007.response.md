Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. If s[i] != s[n - i - 1], then `is_spalindrome` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
