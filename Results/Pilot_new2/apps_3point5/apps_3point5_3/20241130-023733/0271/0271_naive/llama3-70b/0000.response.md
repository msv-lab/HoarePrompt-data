Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by rounding the input number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The logic implemented in the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

1. If the number ends with 0, the program prints the number itself as it is already rounded.
2. If the units digit of the input number is less than or equal to 5, the program rounds down to the nearest integer ending with 0.
3. If the units digit of the input number is greater than 5, the program rounds up to the nearest integer ending with 0.

Given the logic and the examples provided, the program covers all possible scenarios and produces the correct output for each case.
