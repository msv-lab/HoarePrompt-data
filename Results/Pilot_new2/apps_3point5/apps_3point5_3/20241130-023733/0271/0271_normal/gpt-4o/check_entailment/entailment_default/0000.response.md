Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly rounds the input number `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, adjusts `n` to be either rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 or rounded up. The adjusted value is then printed as the result. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description: 
- If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`.
- If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n`.
- The code is correct for all the given examples and follows the problem description accurately.
