Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, and `n` is not divisible by 10. The current value of `n` is such that the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. The code calculates and prints the result of `n - n % 10`, which is the number obtained by removing the last digit of `n`.**
