Output State: **The function will return 'YES' only if all colors in `colors` have the same count as in `desired_counts`. `left` and `right` variables will have their final values based on the loop iterations. The `current_counts` dictionary will reflect the final counts for each color. If there exists at least one color such that the count in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts`, then the function will not return 'YES'.**
