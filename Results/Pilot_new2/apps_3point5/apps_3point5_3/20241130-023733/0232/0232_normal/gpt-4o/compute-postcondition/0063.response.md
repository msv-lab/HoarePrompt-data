Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It creates a dictionary of desired counts for each color and then iterates through the colors list, updating the current counts of each color. The function checks if all current counts match the desired counts for each color, returning 'YES' in that case. If the condition is not met after the loop, it returns 'NO'. The function handles cases where all colors have the same count as desired, and cases where not all colors meet the desired counts, accurately determining the final return value based on the color counts.**
