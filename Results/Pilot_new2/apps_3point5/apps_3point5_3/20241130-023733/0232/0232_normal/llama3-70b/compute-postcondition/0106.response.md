Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `i` + 5, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `n`, `window_counts` is populated based on sorted values in the `counts` list, `found` is True, `color` is the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is reset to a value that is 1 greater than its previous value if `color` is not already in `window_counts`. All counts in `window_counts.values()` are equal to corresponding targets in the `counts` list, and `found` remains True.***
