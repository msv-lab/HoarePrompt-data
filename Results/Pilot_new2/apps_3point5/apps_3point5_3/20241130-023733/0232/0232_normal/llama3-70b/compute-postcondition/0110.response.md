Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `j` are integers, `found` is True. After the execution of the if statement, all conditions hold true: n is an integer greater than i + 5, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1, j is less than n, window_counts is populated based on sorted values in the counts list, color is the value of colors[j], window_counts[color] is now incremented by 1. All counts in window_counts.values() are equal to corresponding targets in the counts list, and found remains True. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
