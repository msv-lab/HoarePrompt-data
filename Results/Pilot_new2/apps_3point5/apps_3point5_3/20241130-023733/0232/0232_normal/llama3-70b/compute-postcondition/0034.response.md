Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `colors` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least n colors, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the key as each distinct color in colors and the value is the count of that color in the list, `found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary with color as the key and value equal to 0 for all colors except `color`, where its value is 0, `j` is equal to `i+1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list, if `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then all colors have a value of 0 in `window_counts` except for `color` which has a value of 0.***
