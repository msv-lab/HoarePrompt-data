Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the program variables `n`, `m`, `colors`, `color`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `found`, `window_counts`, and `j` maintain their initial conditions stated in the precondition. If all the counts of colors in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
