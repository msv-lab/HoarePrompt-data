Correctness: **True**

The program correctly takes an integer between 0 and 99 as input and converts it into words based on the English numerals. It handles cases where the input is between 0 and 9, between 11 and 19, and between 20 and 99. The program follows the problem description by returning the correct string representation of the input number using the provided lists of words for ones, teens, and tens. The hyphen is appropriately added when needed to represent numbers between 20 and 99. Hence, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
