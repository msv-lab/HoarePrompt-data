You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

You can find all you need to know about English numerals in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99.**
def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven',
    'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    if (0 <= n <= 9) :
        return ones[n]
        #The program returns the string representation of the number 'n' where n is an integer between 0 and 9 as per the list 'ones'
    else :
        if (11 <= n <= 19) :
            return teens[n - 10]
            #The program returns the string representation of the number in the 'teens' list at index n - 10, where n is an integer between 11 and 19 inclusive
        else :
            if (10 <= n <= 99) :
                if (n % 10 == 0) :
                    return tens[n // 10]
                    #The program returns the string representing the tens place of the current value of n
                else :
                    return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of the given integer 'n' in words by concatenating the tens place value from the list 'tens' with the ones place value from the list 'ones' separated by a hyphen.
            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen; tens is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to ninety. n is not between 11 and 19 inclusive, n is not between 10 and 99 inclusive
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen; tens is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to ninety. n is not between 11 and 19 inclusive, n is not between 10 and 99 inclusive
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen; tens is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to ninety. n is not between 11 and 19 inclusive, n is not between 10 and 99 inclusive

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
