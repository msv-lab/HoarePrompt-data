    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of integers lst and calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list. The function assumes the list has at least two elements and the elements are valid integers. However, the function does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains only one element. It also does not include any error handling for cases where the input list is not in the specified format. If the list is not valid, the function may encounter errors or provide unexpected results.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 and all values in input are integers.

    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted set of all divisors of x in reverse order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x` and calculates all the divisors of `x`. It then returns a sorted set of these divisors in reverse order. The function correctly computes the divisors of `x` and sorts them in reverse, fulfilling the specified postcondition.
