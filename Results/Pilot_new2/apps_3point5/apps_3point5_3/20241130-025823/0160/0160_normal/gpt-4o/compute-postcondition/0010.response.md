According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` contains values for `i` where `x` is divisible by `i` and `i` is increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and the value of `divisors` needs to be updated to include `x // i` for the new `i`.

State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, divisors is a set containing the value of i that was added by the code execution and divisors now contains x // i for all i where x is divisible by i and i is increased by 1 and i is less than or equal to the square root of x, i is increased by 1**
