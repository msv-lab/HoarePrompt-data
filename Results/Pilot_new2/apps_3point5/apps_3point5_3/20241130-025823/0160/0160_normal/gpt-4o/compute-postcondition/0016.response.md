The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer. The parameter constraints are as follows: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and all values in the input are integers. After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted set of all divisors of `x` in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` and return a sorted set of all divisors of `x` in reverse order.
