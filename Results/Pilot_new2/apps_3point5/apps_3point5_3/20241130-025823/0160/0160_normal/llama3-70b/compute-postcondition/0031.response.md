Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers N and K as input, along with a list of integers A. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. After that, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of the gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor. The function does not have any return value specified. **
