According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is:
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, A is a list of integers based on the input split, gcd is equal to the gcd of the previous gcd and A[i], i is 2**
