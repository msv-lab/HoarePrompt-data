Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the input list A. Then, it iterates up to the square root of the gcd to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The program follows the requirements of the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
