Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly takes the input of the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station.
- It then iterates through each bus route, calculates the time difference for each bus route based on the current time `t`, and stores the index of the bus route with the smallest time difference.
- The code handles all the bus routes and calculates the correct index of the bus route Serval will use based on the minimum time difference.
- The output is the index of the bus route that Serval will use, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
