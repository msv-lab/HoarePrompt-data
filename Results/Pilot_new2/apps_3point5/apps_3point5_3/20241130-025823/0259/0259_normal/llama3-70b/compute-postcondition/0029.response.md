Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, t is a positive integer, buses contains at least 3 tuples, _ is incremented by n, s and d are assigned values from the third tuple in the list, min_time is equal to `(t - s) % d`, ans is equal to i + 1 if time < min_time, otherwise ans retains its previous value, i is 2, time is equal to `(t - s) % d`, min_time is equal to the lesser of `(t - s) % d` and the previous value of min_time.***
