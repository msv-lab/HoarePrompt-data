Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines which bus route Serval will use based on the given input. It iterates through each bus route, calculates the wait time for each route, and chooses the route with the minimum wait time. The chosen route is then returned as the output which aligns with the problem description. 

The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and ensures that Serval will choose the bus route with the minimum wait time. Therefore, the program is correct.
