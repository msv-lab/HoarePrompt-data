Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, min_wait_time is infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, s_i is the first element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes, d_i is the second element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes. s_i is less than t. The current value of min_wait_time is infinity. The current value of chosen_route is -1. The current value of i is 0. The current value of s_i is the first element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes. The current value of d_i is the second element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes. Additionally, ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0)***
