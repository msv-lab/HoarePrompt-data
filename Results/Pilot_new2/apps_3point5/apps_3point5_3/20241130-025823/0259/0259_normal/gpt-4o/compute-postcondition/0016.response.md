Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers. bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers. min_wait_time is now equal to the current value of wait_time. chosen_route is i + 1. i is 0. s_i is the first element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes. d_i is the second element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes. If s_i >= t, wait_time is equal to the difference between s_i and t. If s_i < t, wait_time is 0 when (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, otherwise wait_time is d_i - ((t - s_i) mod d_i). The current value of wait_time is less than min_wait_time.***
