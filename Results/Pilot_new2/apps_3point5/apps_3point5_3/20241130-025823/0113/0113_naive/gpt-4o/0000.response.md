Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the k-rounding of n as described in the problem description. It calculates the multiplier needed to add k zeros to the end of n by using the formula `10 ** k`. Then it calculates the minimum positive integer x that satisfies the conditions by multiplying n with `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. It handles all potential cases and produces the correct output for all given inputs.
