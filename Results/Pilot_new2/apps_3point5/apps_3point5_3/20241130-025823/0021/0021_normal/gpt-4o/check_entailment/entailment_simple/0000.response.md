Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of n and the array a.
2. It correctly finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array.
3. It calculates the distances of the minimum element from the ends of the array and the distances of the maximum element from the ends of the array.
4. It then calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by considering all possible swap positions.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum distance as output, which is what the problem description requires. 

The program follows the problem description and correctly solves the given problem.
