The function `func` reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance of the indices of the minimum value (1) and maximum value (`n`) in the array from the boundaries (0 and `n-1`), and prints this maximum distance value. The function does not have a return value.
