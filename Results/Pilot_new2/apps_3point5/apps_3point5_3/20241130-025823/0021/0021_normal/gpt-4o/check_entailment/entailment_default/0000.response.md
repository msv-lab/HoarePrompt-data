Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The code does not follow the problem description for the case when the minimum and maximum elements are already in the positions 0 and n-1 respectively. In this case, the code should not perform any swap and output should be 0. However, the code will still calculate the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements even when they are already at the boundaries.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the scenario described in the problem statement.
