Correctness: True

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance of the indices of the minimum value (1) and maximum value (`n`) in the array from the boundaries (0 and `n-1`), and prints this maximum distance value. The program's logic aligns with the requirements of the problem description and will always output the correct maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after exactly one swap.
