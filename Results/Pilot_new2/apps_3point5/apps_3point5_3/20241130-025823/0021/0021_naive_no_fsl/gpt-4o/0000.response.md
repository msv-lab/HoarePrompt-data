Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the position of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and then calculates the distance of these elements from the beginning and end of the array. It then finds the maximum distance possible between the minimum and maximum elements by considering all four possible scenarios. The program is able to output the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
