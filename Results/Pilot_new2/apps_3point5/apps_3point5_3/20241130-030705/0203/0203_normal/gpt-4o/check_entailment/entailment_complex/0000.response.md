Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, processes the votes based on the order of employees from the 'D' and 'R' fractions, and determines the outcome of the vote. It simulates the voting process by maintaining queues for 'D' and 'R' employees and updates the indices based on the order of voting. The program ends when only one faction has employees eligible to vote, and it correctly determines the outcome based on which queue is empty.

The program iterates through the voting process as described in the problem description, and the logic used to determine the outcome aligns with the rules of the voting scenario. Therefore, it always produces the correct outcome for any given input.
