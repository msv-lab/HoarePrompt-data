The function reads an integer n and a string of votes containing 'D' and 'R' characters. It then processes the votes based on the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters in the input string. The function simulates a voting process where 'D' and 'R' employees are represented by queues. It iterates through the queues, updating indices based on the value of n. At the end, it determines the majority party by checking which queue is empty. If there is a tie, it returns "Tie".
