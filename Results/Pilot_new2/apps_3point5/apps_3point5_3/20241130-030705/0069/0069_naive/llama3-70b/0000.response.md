Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, calculates the balance of the input string $s$, and then determines the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$. It handles the case where there might be an infinite number of prefixes and outputs -1 accordingly. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
