Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case.
2. It calculates the balance of the given string correctly.
3. It then generates a list of prefix balances for the string.
4. It checks if the balance is zero and the target balance is in the list of prefix balances and appends -1, or if the balance is non-zero, it counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance and appends the count.
5. Finally, it prints the results for each test case as required.

The program follows the problem description for each potential case and provides the correct output.
