Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string. It then calculates the balance of the string and based on the conditions given in the problem description, it calculates the number of prefixes with the desired balance or outputs -1 if there are an infinite number of such prefixes.

The program ensures that it handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem description, making it correct.
