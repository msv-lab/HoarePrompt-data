The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input, then iterates `T` times. Within each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, calculates the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, computes the balance between the counts, and based on certain conditions prints different values. If the balance equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`, if a certain condition is met, it prints -1, otherwise it calculates and prints a specific value. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.
