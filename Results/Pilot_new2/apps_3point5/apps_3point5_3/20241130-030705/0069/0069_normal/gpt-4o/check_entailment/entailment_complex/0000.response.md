Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description by correctly reading the input data, calculating the balance of the binary string $s$, calculating the balance of all prefixes, and then determining the number of prefixes of $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ based on the provided conditions. The program handles the case where there may be an infinite number of such prefixes by outputting -1 when necessary. Additionally, the explanation provided in the annotated program matches the functionality of the code. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
