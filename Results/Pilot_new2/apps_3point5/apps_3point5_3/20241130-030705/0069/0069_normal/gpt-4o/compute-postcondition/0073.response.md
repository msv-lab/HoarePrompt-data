Output State: $T$ remains the first integer value from the data list, `n` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `x` is assigned the integer value `int(data[8 + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[8 + 2]`, `data` remains a list containing input values and is not empty, `index` is now 8, `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `results` will contain -1 if `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list and 0 if `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` list, `prefix_balances` is a list with n elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the total number of times the condition $((x - b) \% balance == 0$ and $(x - b) // balance >= 0)$ is satisfied after all iterations of the loop have finished. 
After executing the code snippet, the `count` value is appended to the `results` list.
Output State: **results will contain appended count value**
