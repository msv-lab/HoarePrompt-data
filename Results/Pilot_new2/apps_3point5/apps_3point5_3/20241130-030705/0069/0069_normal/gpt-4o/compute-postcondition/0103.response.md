Postcondition: ***`T` is `T - n`, `n` is an integer equal to `data[8]`, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is a string value equal to `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, and it is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` list has at least one more element added to it, `count` is 2. The condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 holds true.***
