Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. It does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the case when there is an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. 

In the provided program, when the balance is 0, it checks if the desired balance $x$ is in the prefix balances and then appends -1 to the results. However, according to the problem description, if there is an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance, the program should output -1. The program does not properly handle this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.
