Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `seen_remainders` remain the same. `remainder` is the value of `n % i` where `i` is incremented by 1 and within the range of 1 to `k+1`. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the program returns the string 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, it is added to `seen_remainders`.**
