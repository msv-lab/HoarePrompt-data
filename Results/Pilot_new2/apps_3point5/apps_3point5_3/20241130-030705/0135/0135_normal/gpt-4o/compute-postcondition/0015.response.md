According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `k`, and `seen_remainders` are integers and a set, respectively. The current `remainder` has been added to `seen_remainders`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and be within the range of 1 to `k+1`.
State: **`n`, `k`, and `seen_remainders` remain the same, `remainder` has been added to `seen_remainders`, `i` is incremented by 1 and should be within the range of 1 to `k+1`**
