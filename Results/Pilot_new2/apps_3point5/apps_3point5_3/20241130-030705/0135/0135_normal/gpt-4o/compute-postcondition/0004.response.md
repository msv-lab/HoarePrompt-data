According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` need to be adjusted so that `k` is less than `n`, and the loop can execute. Additionally, since seen_remainders is an empty set, no adjustment is needed for this variable before the loop starts.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `k` is less than `n`, seen_remainders is an empty set**
