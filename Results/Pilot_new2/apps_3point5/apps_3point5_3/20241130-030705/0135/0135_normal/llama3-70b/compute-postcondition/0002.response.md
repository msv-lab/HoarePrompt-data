According to the code, the loop will execute for each `i` in the range from 1 to `k` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. 

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen` is an empty set, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1**
