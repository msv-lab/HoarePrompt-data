Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes input integers n and k, then iterates through all integers i from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. It uses a set `seen` to keep track of all unique remainders encountered so far. If a remainder is already in the set, it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, if no duplicate remainders are found, it prints 'Yes' at the end. This matches the requirements of the problem description and ensures that all remainders are distinct before printing 'Yes'.
