Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the time taken to move between two points based on the floors and blocks they are located on. The minimum block time is computed by finding the minimum distance between the blocks multiplied by 15. The minimum floor time is calculated based on the difference between the floors multiplied by 5 with an additional fixed time of 10. Finally, the total time taken for the movement is printed.**
