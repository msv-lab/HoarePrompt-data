Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` where `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The function calculates the total time required for an item to move from `block_a` and `floor_a` to `block_b` and `floor_b` based on specific conditions. It determines the time to exit, walk times between blocks, and the time to the target floor, then sums these times to obtain the total time.**
