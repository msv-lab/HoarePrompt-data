Output State: **`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are assigned the locations of the items `a` and `b` respectively. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is set to 0. If `floor_a` is not equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is set to 10 + (`floor_a` - 1). `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n`, multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15.**
