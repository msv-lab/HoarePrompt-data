Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function calculates the total time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given conditions such as elevator waiting time, walking time between blocks, and target floor time. The `get_location` function correctly calculates the block and floor numbers for a given apartment in the round-shaped building. 

The output description provided also aligns with the code functionality, explaining how the `func_1` function calculates the total time step by step based on the movement constraints in the building.

Overall, the code appears to cover all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately. No edge cases or scenarios have been identified where the code fails to meet the requirements.
