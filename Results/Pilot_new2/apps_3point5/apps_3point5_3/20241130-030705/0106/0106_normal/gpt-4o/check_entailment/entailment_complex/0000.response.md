Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, as well as the provided examples, it can be observed that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `get_location` handle the calculation of the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment in a round-shaped building with multiple blocks, floors, and apartments. The code considers the specific time taken for different movements such as walking, using the lift, and going up or down the stairs, as outlined in the problem description. Additionally, the annotations provide clarity on the state of the program before and after function calls, ensuring that the calculations are done accurately.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, and the provided examples demonstrate the correct functioning of the program. Hence, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
