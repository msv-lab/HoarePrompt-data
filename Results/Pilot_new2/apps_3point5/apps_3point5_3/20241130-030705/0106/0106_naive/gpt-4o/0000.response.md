Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the provided problem description. It takes into account the time required for Edward to exit his apartment, the time to walk around the building in either direction, and the time to reach Natasha's apartment floor. The calculations for different scenarios are implemented correctly. Since the program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and the logic is sound, the correctness is deemed to be True.
