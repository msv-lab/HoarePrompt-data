Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem description. The code calculates the floor and block numbers of both apartments, determines the minimum block time to move between the blocks, and then calculates the minimum floor time to move between the floors within the same block. Finally, it sums up these times to get the total minimum time, which aligns with the problem requirements. The code covers all scenarios and edge cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring the correctness of the solution.
