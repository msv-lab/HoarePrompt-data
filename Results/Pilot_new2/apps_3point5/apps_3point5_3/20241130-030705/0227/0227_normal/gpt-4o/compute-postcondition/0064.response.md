Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists a pair of elements in list `a` such that their difference is also in list `a`, otherwise `can_form` remains False. If `can_form` is not True, `assigned` contains all elements of list `a` and `m` is equal to the number of times the condition was not met during the loop execution.**
