Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if there exists a pair of elements `x` and `y` in the `assigned` list such that `a[i] = x + y`. `assigned` list remains non-empty. `m` is increased by the total number of pairs found, `i` is increased by 1. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is true for any pair, the loop is exited. Additionally, the current value of `can_form` is False***
