Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a Boolean. If `a[i] - x` is found in the `assigned` list, `can_form` becomes True. The list `assigned` remains non-empty. Both `m` and `i` are increased by 1. `x` is assigned as the first element in `assigned`. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is true, the loop or if statement is exited.***
