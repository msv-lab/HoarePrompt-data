According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to the double of the element at index `i - 1`, then `m` is updated to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` should still be greater than 1.
- `a` must remain sorted list of integers.
- `m` should remain as 2.
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 2**
