Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. The program first sorts the input sequence and then iterates through each element to determine if the current element can be formed using the already assigned variables. If not, it increments the count of variables required. The program handles all potential cases by checking if the current element can be formed using a combination of existing variables. Since the program iterates through each element and correctly updates the count of required variables, it covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output.
