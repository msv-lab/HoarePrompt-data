Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote by finding the minimum of the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and one-fourth of the number of pears. Then, it calculates the total fruits required for the compote based on the minimum number of lemons. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, as the minimum number of each fruit required to maintain the 1:2:4 ratio is correctly considered.
