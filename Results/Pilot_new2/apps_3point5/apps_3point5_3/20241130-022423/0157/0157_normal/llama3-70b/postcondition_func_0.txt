The function `func` reads three positive integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) as input. It then calculates the minimum value among a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. Finally, it prints the result of adding this minimum value with itself multiplied by 2 and 4. The function does not explicitly return a value.
