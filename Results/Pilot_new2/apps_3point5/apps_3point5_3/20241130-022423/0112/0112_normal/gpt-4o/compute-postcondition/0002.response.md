According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, num is an integer greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, and all elements in `used_cubes` are False.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0; `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are False**
