Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, `found` is True. If `found` is not True, all conditions of the precondition remain the same.***
