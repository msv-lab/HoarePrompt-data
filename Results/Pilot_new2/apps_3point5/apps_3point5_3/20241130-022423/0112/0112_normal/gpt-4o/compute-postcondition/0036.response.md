Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True except for `used_cubes[i]` which is now False, `found` is True, `n` must be greater than 1, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and `used_cubes[i]` is now True. After the if else block, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
