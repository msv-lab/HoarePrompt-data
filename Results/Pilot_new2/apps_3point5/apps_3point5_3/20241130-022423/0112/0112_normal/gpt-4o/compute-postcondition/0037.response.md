According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True except for `used_cubes[i]` which is now False, `found` is True, `n` must be greater than 1, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and `used_cubes[i]` is now True. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `digit` must be updated to be the last digit in the list, `used_cubes` must have all elements as True, `found` must still be True, and `n` must be updated to be greater than the current value.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, `found` is True, `n` must be greater than the current value**
