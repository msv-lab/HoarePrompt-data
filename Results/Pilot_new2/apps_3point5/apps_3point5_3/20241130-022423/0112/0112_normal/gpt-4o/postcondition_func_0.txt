The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cubes`. `n` is an integer in the range [1, 3], and `cubes` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube, within the range [0, 9]. The function calculates the maximum integer value x such that x + 1 can be formed using the numbers in the cube_faces set. The code initializes cube_faces as a list of sets created from the cube values, and then iterates to find the maximum x by checking if x + 1 can be formed. The return value is this maximum integer x.
