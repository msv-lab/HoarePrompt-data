#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3. cubes is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube, such that 0 <= a_{i}_{j} <= 9.**
def func_1(n, cubes):
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]
    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of n lists, cube_faces is a list of sets, x is adjusted to the maximum integer value possible such that x + 1 can be formed using the numbers in the cube_faces set
    return x
    #The program returns the maximum integer value x such that x + 1 can be formed using the numbers in the cube_faces set
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cubes`. `n` is an integer in the range [1, 3], and `cubes` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube, within the range [0, 9]. The function calculates the maximum integer value x such that x + 1 can be formed using the numbers in the cube_faces set. The code initializes cube_faces as a list of sets created from the cube values, and then iterates to find the maximum x by checking if x + 1 can be formed. The return value is this maximum integer x.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer greater than 0.**
def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))
    used_cubes = [False] * n
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing all the digits of `num`, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, and `found` is True
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is an integer greater than 0. It then iterates through the digits of `num` and checks if each digit can be formed using a set of cube faces. If all digits can be formed, it returns True. If any digit cannot be formed, it returns False. However, there is a discrepancy between the annotations and the actual code as the annotations mention returning False in all cases, whereas the code returns True if all digits can be formed successfully.
