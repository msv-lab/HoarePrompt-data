The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, then reads `n` lists of integers and creates a set `digits` containing the string representation of each digit in all the lists. If '0' is in `digits`, it is removed. The function then finds the maximum number by sorting the digits in descending order, converting them to an integer, and prints the result. The function does not have any return value.
