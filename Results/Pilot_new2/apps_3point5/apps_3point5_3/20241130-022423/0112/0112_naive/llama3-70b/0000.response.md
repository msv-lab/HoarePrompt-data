Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, collects all unique digits from the cubes excluding 0, removes the digit 0 if it exists, sorts the digits in descending order, and combines them to form the maximum number x that Masha can make. This logic ensures that Masha can build all numbers from 1 to the calculated maximum number. The program covers all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately.
