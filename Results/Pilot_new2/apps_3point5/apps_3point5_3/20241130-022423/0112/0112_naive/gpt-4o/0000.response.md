Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by iterating through all possible numbers from 1 to x and checking if Masha can form that number using the available cubes. The function `can_form_number` checks if a given number can be formed using the faces of the cubes. The program continues to increment x until a number cannot be formed anymore. Overall, the program handles the rotation of cubes and formation of numbers as described in the problem statement. The use of sets for cube faces and checking for availability of digits ensures that the program follows the given constraints.
