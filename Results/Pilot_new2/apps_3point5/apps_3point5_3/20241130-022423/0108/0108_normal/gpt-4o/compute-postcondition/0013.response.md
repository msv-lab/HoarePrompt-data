According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string `target`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, it is known that `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` must be less than len(s) and `j` must be less than target_len. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `j` needs to be increased by 1. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` must be less than len(s) and `j` must be less than target_len**. `i` and `j` need to be adjusted such that `i + 1 < len(s)` and `j + 1 < target_len`.
