According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the current values of s[i] and target[j] are equal. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than len(s) and `j` must be less than target_len. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` must be less than len(s) and `j` must be less than target_len**
