According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `char`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string, and `char` represents each lowercase letter in the alphabet string. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` needs to be a lowercase letter that is present in the string `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string, and `char` is a lowercase letter present in `s`**
