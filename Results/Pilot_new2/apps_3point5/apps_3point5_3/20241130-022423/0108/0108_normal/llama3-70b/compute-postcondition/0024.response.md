The loop iterates until all occurrences of `char` in `s` have been replaced by the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The loop will execute at least once if `char` is present in `s`.

Output State: **`s` has all occurrences of `char` replaced by the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` contains all occurrences of `char` concatenated in the order they were replaced, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet` after all iterations of the loop have executed.**
