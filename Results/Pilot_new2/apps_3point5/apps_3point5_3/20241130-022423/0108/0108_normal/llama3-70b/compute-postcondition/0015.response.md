According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. Right before the loop, `s` is a non-empty string with all occurrences of `char` replaced by the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` contains all occurrences of `char` concatenated in the order they were replaced, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that has not been processed yet. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` should still be present in `s`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with all occurrences of `char` replaced by the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` contains all occurrences of `char` concatenated in the order they were replaced, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that has not been processed yet**
