According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet` string. Since `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, the loop will execute for each lowercase letter. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the `s` string is not empty (input() should return a non-empty string), `res` remains empty or gets reset within the loop, and `char` represents each lowercase letter in the alphabet string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string, `char` represents each lowercase letter in the alphabet string**
