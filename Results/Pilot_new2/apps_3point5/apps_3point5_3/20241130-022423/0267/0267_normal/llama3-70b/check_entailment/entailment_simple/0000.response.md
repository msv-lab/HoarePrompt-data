Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by using dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The `func_1` function correctly calculates this sum by subtracting the count of numbers between $l$ and $r$ that are divisible by $k$ from the count of numbers between $1$ and $l-1$ that are divisible by $k. The `count` function efficiently calculates the count of numbers that meet the criteria using dynamic programming and the provided formula.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and calculates the required sum modulo $998244353$ as requested.
