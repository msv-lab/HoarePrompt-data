According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10 and `k` is less than 10. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `k`.
State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated results, `k` is not equal to 0, (n, k) is not in `dp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k] = 9, `i` is 11, `dp[n, k] = 9 * 10**
