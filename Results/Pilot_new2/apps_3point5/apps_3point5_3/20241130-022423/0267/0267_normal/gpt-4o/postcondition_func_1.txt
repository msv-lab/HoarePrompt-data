The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The function iterates over the range [l, r] and for each number, it calls `func_1` with the number and `k`. If `func_1` returns true for any number, that number is added to `total_sum`. The final `total_sum` is then returned as the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition func_1(num, k) % MOD.
