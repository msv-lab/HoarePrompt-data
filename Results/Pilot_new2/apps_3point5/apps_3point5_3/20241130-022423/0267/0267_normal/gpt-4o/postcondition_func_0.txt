The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^18 and k is an integer within the range of 1 to 10. It returns True if the number of unique digits in the string representation of n is less than or equal to k; otherwise, it returns False. The function checks if the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k by converting n to a string, creating a set of its digits, and comparing the length of the set to k.
