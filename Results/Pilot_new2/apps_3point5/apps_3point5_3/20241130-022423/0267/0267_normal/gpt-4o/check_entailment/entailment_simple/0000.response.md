Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. 
- Function 1 (`func_1`) checks if the number `n` has at most `k` different digits by converting `n` to a string, creating a set of its digits, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to `k`.
- Function 2 (`func_2`) iterates through all numbers in the range `[l, r]` and accumulates the sum of numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits by calling `func_1`. The sum is then calculated modulo `MOD`.
- The program ensures that each number in the sum from `l` to `r` contains at most `k` different digits, as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
