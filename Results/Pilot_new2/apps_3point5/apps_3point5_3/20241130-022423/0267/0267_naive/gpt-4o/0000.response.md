Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for $l$, $r$, and $k$.
2. The program defines a function `func_1(n, k)` which checks if a number `n` has at most `k` different digits.
3. The program iterates through all numbers from $l$ to $r$, calculates the sum of numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits, and takes the modulo `998244353` at each step.
4. The program prints the final total sum modulo `998244353`.
5. The logic of the program follows the problem description accurately and covers all potential cases, making it correct.
