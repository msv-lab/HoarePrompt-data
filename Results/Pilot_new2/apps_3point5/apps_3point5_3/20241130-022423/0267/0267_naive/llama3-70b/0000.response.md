Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. The program uses a recursive `count` function with memoization to calculate the required result efficiently.

The `count` function correctly calculates the number of integers from `1` to `n` that contain at most `k` different digits. The logic within the function handles different cases such as when `n` is less than `10**k` and when `n` is greater than or equal to `10**k`.

The main `func_1` function then computes the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` by subtracting the count of numbers from `1` to `l-1` from the count of numbers from `1` to `r`. The modulo operation is correctly applied to the final result.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the given constraints.
