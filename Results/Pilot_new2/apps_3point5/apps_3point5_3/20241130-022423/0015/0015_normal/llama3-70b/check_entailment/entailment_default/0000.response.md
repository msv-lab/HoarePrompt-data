Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads three integers a, b, and c from input.
- If c is 0, it checks if a is equal to b and prints 'YES' accordingly, which aligns with the problem description for this case.
- If c is not 0, it checks if (b - a) is divisible by c and the division result is non-negative to print 'YES', which also matches the problem description for this case.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
