Postcondition: ***a, b, c are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. If c == 0 and a is equal to b, then 'YES' is printed. If c == 0 and a is not equal to b, a and b remain unchanged and 'YES' is printed. If c is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
