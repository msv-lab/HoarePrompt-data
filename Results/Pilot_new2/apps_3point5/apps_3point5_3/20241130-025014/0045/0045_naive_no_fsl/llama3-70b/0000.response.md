Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input values for n and k.
2. It then checks if n is less than k and prints -1 if true, which follows the problem description.
3. Next, it creates a sequence of k positive numbers by iterating from 1 to k and subtracting the number from n in each iteration, then appending the number to the sequence.
4. If the length of the sequence is not equal to k, it prints -1.
5. Finally, it prints the resulting sequence by joining the numbers with a space, which meets the output requirements.
6. The program handles the case where the answer does not exist by outputting -1.
