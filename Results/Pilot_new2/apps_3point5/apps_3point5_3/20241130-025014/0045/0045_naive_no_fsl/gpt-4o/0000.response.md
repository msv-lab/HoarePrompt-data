Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum sum of the sequence using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2` and checks if it is greater than `n`. If it is, then it returns -1, as stated in the problem description.
2. It then calculates the value `d` which is the common divisor for all elements in the sequence.
3. It distributes the remainder `remainder = n - d * min_sum` to the sequence elements to ensure that the sum is exactly equal to `n`.
4. The program outputs the resulting sequence if it exists, or -1 if there is no possible sequence.
5. The program correctly handles multiple test cases and provides an output according to the problem description. 

Overall, the program seems to be correct and fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
