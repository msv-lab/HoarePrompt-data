    #The program returns a list 'sequence' after performing the described operations
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two positive integer parameters n and k. It calculates the minimum sum using the formula k*(k+1)/2 and compares it with n. If the minimum sum exceeds n, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates a sequence of length k with elements being multiples of d, where d is n divided by the minimum sum. The function then adjusts the sequence based on the remainder left after forming the initial sequence. Finally, it returns the generated sequence. The functionality covers cases where the minimum sum is greater than n, leading to a return of -1, and cases where the sequence is successfully generated and returned.
