The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers. If `b` is 0, the function returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers, `a` and `b`, and return the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` when `b` is 0.
