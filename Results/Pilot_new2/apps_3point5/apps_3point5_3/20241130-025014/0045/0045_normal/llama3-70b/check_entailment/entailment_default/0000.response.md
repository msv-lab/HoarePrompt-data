Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code follows the problem description for every potential case. The program correctly handles the input of positive integer numbers `n` and `k`, and then creates a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum is equal to `n`. The code ensures that the greatest common divisor of the sequence is maximal. It also correctly outputs -1 if there is no possible sequence. Additionally, the output hints align with the code and confirm that the code functions as expected. The code iterates through numbers from 1 to `k` to construct the sequence, ensuring that each number added maintains the strictly increasing order and the sum equals `n`. Therefore, the code is correct.
