The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b` by utilizing the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0. The function then returns this greatest common divisor. Therefore, the main purpose of the function is to compute the greatest common divisor of two positive integers `a` and `b` when `b` is 0.
