According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable b. If b is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a is now equal to the previous value of b, and b is now equal to the remainder of the previous value of a divided by the previous value of b. For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of b must be non-zero, which means the previous value of a divided by the previous value of b must result in a non-zero remainder. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is now equal to the previous value of b, and b is now equal to the remainder of the previous value of a divided by the previous value of b, b must be non-zero for the loop to execute**
