Correctness: **True**

The program reads two non-negative integers as strings, removes any leading zeros, and then compares the two numbers. It correctly prints "<" if the first number is less than the second, ">" if the first number is greater than the second, and "=" if the numbers are equal. The program follows the problem description and handles all cases as specified.
