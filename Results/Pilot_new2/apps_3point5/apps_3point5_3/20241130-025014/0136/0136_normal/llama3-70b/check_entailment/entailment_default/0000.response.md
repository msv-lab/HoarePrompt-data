Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros, `a` and `b`, from the user input. It then compares `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<', and if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints '>'. The code correctly follows the problem description for all cases. The comparison is based on the numerical values of the integers, and leading zeros are removed before comparison. The code handles cases where the numbers are equal, where one number is less than the other, and where one number is greater than the other. The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
