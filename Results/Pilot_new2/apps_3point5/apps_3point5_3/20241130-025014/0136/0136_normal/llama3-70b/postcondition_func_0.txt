The function `func` reads two non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros, `a` and `b`, from the user input. It then compares `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<', and if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints '>'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
