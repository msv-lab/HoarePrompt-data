Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is the input string after removing any leading zeros. `a` is not equal to `b`. If the current value of `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program prints '>'.***
