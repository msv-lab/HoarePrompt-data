Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, each with no more than 10^6 digits, and compares their values based on their lengths and actual numerical values.
- It correctly handles the case where both `a` and `b` have leading zeroes by stripping the leading zeroes before comparison.
- If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, it prints '<'.
- If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, it prints '>'.
- If the lengths are equal, it compares the numerical values of `a` and `b` and prints '<', '>', or '=' accordingly.
- The code covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
