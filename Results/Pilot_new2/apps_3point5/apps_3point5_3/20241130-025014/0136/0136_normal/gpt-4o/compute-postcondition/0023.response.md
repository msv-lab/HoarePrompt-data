Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers with no leading zeroes. If `a` is '0', `b` is '0'. If `b` is not '0', `a` is False in a boolean context. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and the length of `a` is not greater than the length of `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, then '<' is printed on the console. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program does not print anything and `a` is either greater than `b` or less than or equal to `b` after the execution of the if else block.***
