Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no leading zeroes. If `a` is '0', `b` is '0'. If `b` is not '0', `a` is False in a boolean context. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. After the if condition, the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`***
