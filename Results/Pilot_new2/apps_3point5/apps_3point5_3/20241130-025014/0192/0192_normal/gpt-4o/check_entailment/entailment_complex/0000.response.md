Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` accurately calculates this minimum number of seconds based on the problem description. Additionally, the constraints specified in the problem description are also satisfied within the program. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the given problem description.
