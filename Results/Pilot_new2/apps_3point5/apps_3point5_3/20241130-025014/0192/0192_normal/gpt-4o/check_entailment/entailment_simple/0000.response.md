Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from a triangle of side length x. 

The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending side lengths of the equilateral triangle. It then calculates the minimum number of operations required by using the formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2), which is derived from the fact that in each operation, Memory can reduce the side length by 1. 

This formula ensures that Memory can reach the desired equilateral triangle side length y from x in the minimum number of steps while maintaining the triangle's non-degenerate nature. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements as specified in the problem description and is correct.
