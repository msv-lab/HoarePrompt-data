Correctness: **False**

The given code simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers `x` and `y`, and prints the result. However, the problem description requires Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from an equilateral triangle of side length x in the minimum number of seconds, by modifying the length of a single side of the triangle in each second.

The code provided does not implement any logic to perform the required operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from x. It only calculates the absolute difference between the two side lengths, which is not the correct approach for solving the problem.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
