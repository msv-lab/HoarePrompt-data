Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by first parsing the input, finding the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price, and then calculating the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening based on the given conditions. The logic of checking if the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price is correct and handles the case where it's optimal not to take any action. The program then calculates the total bourles correctly by determining the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles, and then multiplying the maximum shares with the maximum sell price. Overall, the program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
