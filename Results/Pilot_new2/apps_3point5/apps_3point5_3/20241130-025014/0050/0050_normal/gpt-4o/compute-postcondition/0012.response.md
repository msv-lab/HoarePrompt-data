Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers obtained by splitting the input by spaces. `b` is a list of integers. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. If `max_sell_price <= min_buy_price`, then `r` is printed. Otherwise, `total_bourles` is printed, and no other variables are affected.***
