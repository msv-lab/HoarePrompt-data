Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input by spaces using the `map` function. `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`. `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. The current value of `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to the current value of `min_buy_price`.***
