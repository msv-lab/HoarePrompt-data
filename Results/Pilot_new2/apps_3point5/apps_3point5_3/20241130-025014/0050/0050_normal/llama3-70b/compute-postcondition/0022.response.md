Postcondition: ***`n+1`, `m`, updated `r` based on the conditions mentioned, `s`, `b`, updated `shares` based on the conditions mentioned. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `r` is updated to the remainder of dividing its current value by the value of `s[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
