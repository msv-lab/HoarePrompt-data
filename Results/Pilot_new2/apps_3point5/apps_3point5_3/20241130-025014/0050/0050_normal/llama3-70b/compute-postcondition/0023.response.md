Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are integers. `n` and `m` are between 1 and 30. `r` is between 0 and the maximum value of `s`. `s` is a list of integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers in descending order. `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by each element in `s` for each element in `s` where `r` is greater than or equal to the element in `s`. If `r` is less than the current element in `s`, we break out of the loop.**
