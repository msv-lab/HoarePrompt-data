Output State: **n, m, r are integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000 and they are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space. s is a list of integers obtained by mapping int to the input values split by space and sorted in ascending order. b is a list of integers obtained by mapping int to the input values split by space and sorted in descending order. `shares` is 0**
