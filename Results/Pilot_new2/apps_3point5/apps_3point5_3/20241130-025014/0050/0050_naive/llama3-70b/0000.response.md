Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by first sorting the buy and sell prices, then iterates over the buy prices to buy as many shares as possible in the morning based on the available bourles. It then iterates over the sell prices to sell all shares bought in the morning, maximizing the number of bourles at the end of the evening. The logic is sound and covers all possible cases, ensuring the maximum profit is achieved.
