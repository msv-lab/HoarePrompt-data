Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the total_days as 2^n, then iterates through a loop to update the numerator and denominator values based on the loop index and total_days. After the loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of numerator and denominator, divides both numerator and denominator by the gcd, and returns the remainders of numerator and denominator divided by (10^6 + 3). The functionality does not mention potential edge cases or missing logic.
