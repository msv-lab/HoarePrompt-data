Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the total days in a year based on the input value of `n`, then iterates through a loop to update the numerator and denominator values based on the loop index and total days. After the loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of numerator and denominator, divides both numerator and denominator by the gcd, and returns the remainders of numerator and denominator divided by (10^6 + 3). This aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description.

Additionally, the program handles potential edge cases such as calculating the probability when the number of people interviewed is equal to the number of days in Udayland, as mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified.
