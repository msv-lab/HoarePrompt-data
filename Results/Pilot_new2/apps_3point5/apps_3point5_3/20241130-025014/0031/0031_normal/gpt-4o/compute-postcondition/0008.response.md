According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the initial states need to be adjusted as follows: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, MOD is 1000003, k is less than or equal to 1 << n, total_days is 2^n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1, and i is 0.
State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, MOD is 1000003, k is less than or equal to 1 << n, total_days is 2^n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1, i is 0**
