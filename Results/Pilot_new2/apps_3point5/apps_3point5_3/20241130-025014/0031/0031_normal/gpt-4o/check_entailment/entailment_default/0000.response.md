Correctness: **False**

The output hints do not agree with the code for all potential cases. The function `func_2` does not handle the case when k is greater than 1 << n, as indicated in the output hints. In such cases, the code should print "1 1" as the output, but the code does not have this handling. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
