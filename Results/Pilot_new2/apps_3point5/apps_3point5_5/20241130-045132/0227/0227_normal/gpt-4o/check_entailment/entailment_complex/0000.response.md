Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It finds the minimum number of variables m needed to perform the described sequence of operations. The program sorts the input list of distinct positive integers in ascending order, then iterates through the list to calculate the number of unique differences between elements. This number represents the minimum number of variables required to perform the operations as described in the problem.

The program ensures that each operation assigns the correct value based on the sum of values stored in the variables, and it correctly determines whether the sequence of operations can be performed with the given variables.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
