The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 23, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer is in the range of 1 to 10^9. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of unique differences between elements in the list `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the number of unique differences between elements in the list `a`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a. It returns the number of unique differences between elements in the list a.**
