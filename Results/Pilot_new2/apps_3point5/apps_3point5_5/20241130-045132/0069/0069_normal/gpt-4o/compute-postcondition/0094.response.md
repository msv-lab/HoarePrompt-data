Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the index is increased by n + 1, balance is equal to s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances is a list with cumulative sums of the differences in counts of '0' and '1' up to each index, starting from index 0, T is still greater than 1, n is still the integer value obtained from data at the index, x is still the integer value obtained from data at index + 1, s is still the string data[index + 2], and balance remains equal to 0. If x is in prefix_balances, the results list contains a new element -1. If x is not in prefix_balances, the results list now contains a single element with the value 0.***
