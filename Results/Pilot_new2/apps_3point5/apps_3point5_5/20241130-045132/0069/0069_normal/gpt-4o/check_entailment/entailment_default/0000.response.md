Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code fails to handle the scenario where the balance is 0 but the desired balance 'x' is present in the prefix balances. In this case, the code incorrectly appends -1 to the results list instead of 0. As a result, the program does not provide the correct output for this specific case.
