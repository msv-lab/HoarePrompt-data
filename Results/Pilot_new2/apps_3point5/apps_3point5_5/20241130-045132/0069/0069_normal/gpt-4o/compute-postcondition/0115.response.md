According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `results`. If there are more elements left in the results list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, the result list is printed. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the results list to iterate over.
State: **At least one more element in the results list to iterate over**
