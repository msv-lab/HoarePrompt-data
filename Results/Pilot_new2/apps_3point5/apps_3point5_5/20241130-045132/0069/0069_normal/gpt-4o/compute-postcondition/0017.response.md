Output State: n is equal to the second element of the data list, x is equal to the third element of the data list, s is assigned the value of data[index + 2], index is incremented by 3, results is an empty list, balance is equal to the difference between the count of '0's and the count of '1's in string s, prefix_balances is a list of size n+1 filled with zeros, i is 3, prefix_balances[i] is equal to prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), and prefix_balances[i] is updated to be equal to prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), n is equal to or greater than 2
prefix_balances[i] is equal to prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) has been executed, updating the value of prefix_balances[i] accordingly based on the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1).
