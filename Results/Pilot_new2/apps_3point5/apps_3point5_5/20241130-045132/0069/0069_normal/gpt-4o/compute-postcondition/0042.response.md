Output State: If 'x' is in 'prefix_balances', 'results' list contains -1; otherwise, 'balance' remains 0, 'results' list contains 0, 'count' is the number of elements in 'prefix_balances' that satisfy the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), 'prefix_balances' has at least 'n' + 1 elements and ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is true, 'n' is assigned the integer value of 'data[index]', 'x' is assigned the integer value of 'data[index + 1'].
