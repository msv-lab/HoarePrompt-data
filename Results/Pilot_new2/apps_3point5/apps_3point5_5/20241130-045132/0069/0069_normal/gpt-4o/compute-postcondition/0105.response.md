Output State: **Index is increased by n + 1, balance is equal to s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances has additional element(s), T is greater than 1, n is the integer value obtained from data at the index, x is the integer value obtained from data at index + 1, s is now equal to the string data[index + 2], balance is equal to s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances[i] is updated to prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) where i represents the current index, balance is not equal to 0, count is incremented by 1, and the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied, count is incremented by 1.**
