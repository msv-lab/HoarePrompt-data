Postcondition: ***balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1, n and x are assigned values based on the input split by space, and s contains the input string entered by the user. `cnt0`, `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' in the input string `s`. If balance equals x, n + 1 is printed. If balance does not equal x, if (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, `print(-1)` is executed. Otherwise, x is updated to x - balance + cnt0 - cnt1 + 1.***
