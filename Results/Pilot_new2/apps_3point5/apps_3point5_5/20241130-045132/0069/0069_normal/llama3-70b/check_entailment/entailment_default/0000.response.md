Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n`, the desired balance `x`, and the binary string `s`.
- It calculates the difference in counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, referred to as `balance`.
- Based on the value of `balance` compared to `x`, the code prints different values:
  - If `balance` equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`, which is the length of the string `s` plus 1.
  - If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints -1, indicating an infinite number of prefixes.
  - Otherwise, it prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the number of prefixes with the desired balance.

The code seems to cover the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the given specifications.
