According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `fractions`. If there are more elements in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, the number of employees `n` is a positive integer, and the states are modified based on the conditions mentioned. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1, if not, `remocrats` is incremented by 1.

So, for the loop to execute another time, the adjustment needed will be:
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees. If fraction is 'D', depublicans is increased by 1. If fraction is not 'D', remocrats is incremented by 1.**
