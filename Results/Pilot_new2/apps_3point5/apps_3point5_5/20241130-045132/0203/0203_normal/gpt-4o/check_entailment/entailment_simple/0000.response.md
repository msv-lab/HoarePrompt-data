Correctness: **True**

The program correctly simulates the voting process described in the problem description. It creates two queues, one for each fraction, and iterates over the votes to determine which employee denies the right to vote to the next employee. It continues this process until only one faction's queue is non-empty, which determines the outcome of the vote.

The program ensures that employees can only deny the right to vote to employees who have not made a statement yet, as specified in the problem description. This guarantees that the voting process follows the rules outlined in the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct and always follows the problem description.
