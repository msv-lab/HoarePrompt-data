Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000; `votes` is a string with at least one character; `i` is equal to the total number of characters in the votes string minus 1; if `v` is 'D', `d_queue` must not be empty; if `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` must not be empty; `d_index` is equal to the value removed from the front of `d_queue`; `r_index` is equal to the value removed from the front of `r_queue` except the first element. If `d_index` < `r_index`, `d_queue` has `d_index + n` appended to it. Otherwise, `r_queue` has a new element appended at the end, which is the sum of the previous `r_index` value and `n`.***
