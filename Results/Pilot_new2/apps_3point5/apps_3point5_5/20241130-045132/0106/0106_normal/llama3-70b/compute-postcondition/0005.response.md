Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. `a`, `b` are assigned the integer values obtained by mapping the input after splitting. `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`. `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`. `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
