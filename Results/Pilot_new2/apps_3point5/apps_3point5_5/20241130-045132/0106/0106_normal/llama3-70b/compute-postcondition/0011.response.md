Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers representing the input values. `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time` are calculated based on the input values. If `a_floor > b_floor`, the function calculates `min_block_time` as the minimum of absolute value of `(a_block - b_block)` and `n - abs(a_block - b_block)` multiplied by 15. Additionally, `min_floor_time` is determined as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `a_floor <= b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
