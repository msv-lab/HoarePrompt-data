Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code does not handle the case where Edward and Natasha live in the same block but on different floors. This is because the `get_location` function calculates the block and floor without considering the floor within the block. As a result, the time calculation in `func_1` based on block distances will not be accurate in such cases. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
