The function func_1 accepts integers n, m, k, a, and b representing block numbers, floor numbers, and locations. It calculates the total time taken to travel from floor a to floor b, factoring in walking times between blocks and floors. If floor_a is on the first floor, time_to_exit is 0; otherwise, it is calculated based on the floor_a value. The function then considers direct and reverse walking times between block_a and block_b, selects the minimum time, adds the time to reach the target floor, and returns the total time required for the journey.
