The function `get_location` accepts an integer parameter `apartment` representing Edward or Natasha's apartment number. It calculates and returns the block number and the floor number within the block based on the given apartment number. The block number is calculated as (`apartment` - 1) // (`m` * `k`) + 1, and the floor number within the block is calculated as (`apartment` - 1) % (`m` * `k`) // `k` + 1.
