According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder` after executing the code, `remainder` is the value of `n` modulo `i`. If the remainder is in the set `seen`, then the condition is met. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the new value of `remainder` must not be in the set `seen`.
State: **`n` is not involved in loop execution, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the new value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the value of `n` modulo (`i` + 1), where `i` is the current value of `i` in the loop**.
