Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input. It then iterates from 1 to `k` inclusive, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each `i`. If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits the program. If no remainders are repeated, it prints 'Yes'. 

The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct and prints 'Yes' if they are and 'No' otherwise. The output is determined based on whether there is any repeated remainder or not, which aligns with the problem description. The code also accounts for the constraints of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the code is implemented correctly and aligns with the expected behavior.
