Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input. It then iterates from 1 to `k` inclusive, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each `i`. If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits the program. If no remainders are repeated, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
