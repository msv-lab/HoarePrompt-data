Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all the remainders after dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far and returns "No" if a remainder is already in the set, indicating a duplicate remainder. Otherwise, it returns "Yes" if all remainders are distinct. This ensures that the program accurately determines whether all remainders are distinct as required by the problem description.
