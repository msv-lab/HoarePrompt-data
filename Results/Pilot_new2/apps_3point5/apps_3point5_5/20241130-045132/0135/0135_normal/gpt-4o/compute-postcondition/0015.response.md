According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is less than or equal to k. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and k is strictly less than n. The remainder is n % 2 and has been added to seen_remainders. If the remainder was in seen_remainders, the function would return 'No'. To execute one more time, i should be increased by 1, and the new remainder should be added to seen_remainders.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is strictly less than n, seen_remainders is a set containing the new remainder, i is 3, the new remainder is n % 3**
