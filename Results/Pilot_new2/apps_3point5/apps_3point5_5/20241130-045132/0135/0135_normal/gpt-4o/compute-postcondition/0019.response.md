Output State: **n, k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is strictly less than n. Seen_remainders is a set containing the new remainder, i is 3, the new remainder is n % 3, remainder is n % i. If the remainder is in the seen_remainders set, the program returns the string 'No'. The remainder is added to the seen_remainders set.**
