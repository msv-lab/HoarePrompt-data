According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `n % x != 0`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` must be incremented by 1 and `x` must be adjusted so that the new value of `n % x` is not equal to 0.
State: **`n` has been increased by 1, `x` has been adjusted**
