According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `x`. The loop will execute one more time if `n % x` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` has been adjusted so that `n % x` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `x`. 
State: **`n` has been adjusted so that `n % x` is not equal to 0, `x` needs to be adjusted**
