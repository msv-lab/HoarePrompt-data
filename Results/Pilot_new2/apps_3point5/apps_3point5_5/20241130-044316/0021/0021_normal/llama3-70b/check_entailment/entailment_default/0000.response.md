Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integers and calculates the positions of 1 and `n` in the list.
- It then calculates the maximum and minimum distances between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list as well as the distance of `n - 1 - min_dist`.
- Finally, it prints the maximum of these two distances, which represents the maximum possible distance Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description and all the given examples work correctly.
