Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the positions of the minimum element 1 and the maximum element n in the array. Then, it computes the maximum distance by considering the absolute difference between the positions and subtracting 1. It also calculates the minimum distance by taking the minimum of the absolute difference and subtracting 1 from the size of the array. Finally, it prints the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after the swap. The program considers all possible cases and always maximizes the distance between the minimum and maximum elements with exactly one swap.
