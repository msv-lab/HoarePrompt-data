The variable `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a` using the `index()` method. Since the elements in list `a` are distinct integers from 1 to n, the value of `n` will be present in list `a`. Therefore, the value of `posn` will be the index of `n` in list `a`. 

Output State: **n is an input integer, list a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a**
