Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers, then calculates the maximum possible distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list. The logic used to calculate the maximum distance is correct and follows the problem description accurately. The program handles the edge cases as well by considering the minimum and maximum distances appropriately. Overall, the program achieves the desired outcome as described in the problem statement.
