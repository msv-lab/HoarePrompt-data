The value of `max_pos` is assigned as the index of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input using `input().split()`. The index of the minimum positive integer in list `a` is stored in `min_pos`. Therefore,
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input using `input().split()`; `min_pos` stores the index of the minimum positive integer in list `a`; `max_pos` stores the index of `n` in list `a`**
