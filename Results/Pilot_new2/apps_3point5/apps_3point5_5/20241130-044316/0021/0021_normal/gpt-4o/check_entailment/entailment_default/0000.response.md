Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` and the list of integers `a`.
- It finds the positions of the minimum element `1` and maximum element `n` in the list.
- It calculates the distances of these elements from the boundaries of the list, considering all possible cases.
- Finally, it determines and prints the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements as required in the problem description.
- The code handles all potential cases and follows the problem description for every input example provided in the description.
