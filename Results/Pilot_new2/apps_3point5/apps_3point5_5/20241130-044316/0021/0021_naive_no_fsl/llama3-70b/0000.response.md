Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and logic provided. It calculates the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after performing exactly one swap. It finds the positions of the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n), then calculates the maximum possible distance considering the swap. The logic behind finding the maximum distance is correct based on the problem requirements. The program handles all possible cases and works as expected for the given problem description.
