Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculates the distance between them. It then compares this distance with the other possible distance after a swap and prints the maximum. The logic seems to be correct and handles the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
