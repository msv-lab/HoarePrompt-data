Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i from 1 to N, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, N and K are input integers obtained by splitting the input, gcd is a positive integer, the square root of gcd is an integer, all elements in list A are considered for calculating gcd, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i where gcd is divisible by i, and i squared is not equal to gcd.***
