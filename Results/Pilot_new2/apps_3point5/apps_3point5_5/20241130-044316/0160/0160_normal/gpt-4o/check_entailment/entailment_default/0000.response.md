Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program seems to correctly implement the problem description by first calculating the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, then finding all the divisors of the sum of `A`, and finally checking if each divisor divides every element of `A` after the operations described in the problem.
- The output hints also align with the code, mentioning that the function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list, and `func_2` correctly identifies all divisors of x by iterating up to the square root of x and checking for divisibility.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the logic appears to be correct in handling them. Therefore, the code is correct.
