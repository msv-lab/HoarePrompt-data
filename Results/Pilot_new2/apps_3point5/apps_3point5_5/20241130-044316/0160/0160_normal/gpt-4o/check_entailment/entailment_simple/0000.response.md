Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions. 
- Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of integers. This is used to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the given list. The function iterates through the list and uses the `math.gcd()` function to find the gcd of all the elements. This gcd is then returned as the result, which is in line with the problem description.
- Function 2 (`func_2`) calculates all the divisors of a given integer `x`. It iterates through all numbers up to the square root of `x` and checks if `x` is divisible by that number. If it is divisible, both that number and `x` divided by that number are added to a set of divisors. The function then returns these divisors sorted in reverse order. This function is also aligned with the problem description as it finds all possible divisors of a given integer.

Both functions in the program fulfill the requirements mentioned in the problem description, so the correctness is True.
