The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99. After executing the function body, there are four cases that determine the return value:

Case 1: If n corresponds to a single-digit number, the function returns the string representation of that number from the 'ones' list.

Case 2: If n is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representation from the 'teens' list.

Case 3: If n represents a number in the tens place, the function returns the string representation of the tens place digit of n.

Case 4: If n is a two-digit number, the function returns the string representation where the tens place is obtained from the 'tens' list and the ones place is obtained from the 'ones' list, with a hyphen in between.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer n and return the string representation based on the four defined cases above.
