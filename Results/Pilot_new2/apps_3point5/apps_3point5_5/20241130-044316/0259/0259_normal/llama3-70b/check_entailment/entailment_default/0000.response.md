Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers n and t as input, representing the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station respectively.
- It then reads n pairs of integers representing the arrival times and intervals for each bus route.
- The code calculates the time difference between the arrival time of the bus and the time Serval goes to the station, taking into account the interval between buses.
- It keeps track of the minimum time difference and updates the answer accordingly.
- Finally, it prints the index of the bus route that resulted in the minimum time difference.

The code logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, and it produces the expected output based on the provided examples. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implementing the specified logic.
