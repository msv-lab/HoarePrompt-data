#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_1(n, t, bus_routes):
    min_wait_time = float('inf')
    chosen_route = -1
    for i in range(n):
        s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]
        
        if s_i >= t:
            wait_time = s_i - t
        elif (t - s_i) % d_i == 0:
            wait_time = 0
        else:
            wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
        
        if wait_time < min_wait_time:
            min_wait_time = wait_time
            chosen_route = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `min_wait_time` will contain the minimum wait time of all bus routes, `chosen_route` will contain the route number with the minimum wait time, `n` will remain the same as the original value, `s_i` and `d_i` will contain the source and destination bus stops of the last route in the list, `wait_time` will contain the wait time calculated for the last route in the list.
    return chosen_route
    #The program returns the route number with the minimum wait time
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates through the bus routes to calculate the minimum wait time for each route based on the maximum wait time allowed `t`. Then, it returns the route number with the minimum wait time. However, there is a missing edge case where if all routes exceed the maximum wait time, the function should return a specific value to indicate no route meets the criteria.
