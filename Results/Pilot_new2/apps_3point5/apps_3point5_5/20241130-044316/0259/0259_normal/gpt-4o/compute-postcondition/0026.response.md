Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i` are all variables related to bus route calculations. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then the `min_wait_time` is the newly calculated wait time, the `chosen_route` is the route with the updated minimum wait time, `n` must be greater than the current `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, the `min_wait_time` is the newly calculated wait time, the `chosen_route` is the route with the updated minimum wait time, `n` must be greater than the current `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. In the if part, if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` becomes equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than the current `i + 1`, and `wait_time` retains the value of `min_wait_time`.***
