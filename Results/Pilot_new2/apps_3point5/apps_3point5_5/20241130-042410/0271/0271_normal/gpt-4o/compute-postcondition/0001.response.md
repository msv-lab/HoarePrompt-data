Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer with a range of 0 to 10^9, the value of `remainder` can be any integer from 0 to 9. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer with a value assigned from input; remainder is an integer ranging from 0 to 9 based on the calculation `n % 10`.**
