According to the code, the loop will execute if n is at least 2. Before the loop starts, s is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, so n can be assumed to be at least 1. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, n must be greater than or equal to 2 and i is now 0.
State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, n is at least 2, i is 0**
