According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is at least 2. Since the loop iterates up to n // 2, it means n must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the is_spalindrome variable is not used in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to n is at least 2 and i is 0.
State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; n is the length of string s, n is at least 2, is_spalindrome is True, i is 0**
