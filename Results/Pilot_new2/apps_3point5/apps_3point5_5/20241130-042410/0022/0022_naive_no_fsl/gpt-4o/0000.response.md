Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly defines a function `func_1` that checks if the string is symmetric about the middle. It then reads the input string, calls the function, and prints "TAK" if the string is symmetric and "NIE" otherwise. The logic of the function and the main part of the code align with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
