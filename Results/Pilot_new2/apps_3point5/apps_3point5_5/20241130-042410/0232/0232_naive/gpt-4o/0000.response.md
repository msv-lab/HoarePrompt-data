Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to find if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. It uses two pointers to keep track of the current counts of each color and iterates through the Jedi Knights to check if the desired counts are met. The while loop ensures that the interval is contiguous and contains exactly the desired counts of each color. The program returns 'YES' if such an interval is found and 'NO' otherwise. The implementation covers all possible cases and follows the problem description.
