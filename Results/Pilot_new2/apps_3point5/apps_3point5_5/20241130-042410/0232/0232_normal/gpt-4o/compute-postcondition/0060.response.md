Output State: After the loop executes, the count of all colors in `current_counts` will be equal to the count in `desired_counts` for all colors. If this condition is met, the program will return 'YES'. The final value of 'left' will be such that the loop terminates when all colors have their counts matching the desired counts.
**All colors in current_counts have counts equal to desired_counts, 'left' is at a value where the loop stops**
