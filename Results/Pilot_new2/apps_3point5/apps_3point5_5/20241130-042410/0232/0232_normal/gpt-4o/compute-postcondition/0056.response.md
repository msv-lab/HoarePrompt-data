Postcondition: ***The count of all colors in `current_counts` is still greater than or equal to the count in `desired_counts` for all colors except one color, where `current_counts[color]` is adjusted to not meet the condition. `left` is incremented by 2. If all color counts in `current_counts` match the counts in `desired_counts`, then 'YES' is returned and `left` is incremented by 2.***
