Postcondition: ***`current_counts[colors[left]]` is still greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]` and `left` is increased by 1. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their corresponding counts equal to `current_counts`, then the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
