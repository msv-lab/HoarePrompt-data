State: *`n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `m` is an integer obtained from input split, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors, `counts` is a list containing the mapped integers from the input split, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each color in `colors` is a key, and the value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list, `found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as key and value incremented by 1, `i` is the final value after the loop executes, `color` is the last color in the `colors` list, `color` is equal to colors[j], and the condition `(all((count == target for (count, target) in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts))))` is satisfied. After the execution of the if else block, the color is not in `window_counts` and the overall state of the program is as described.
