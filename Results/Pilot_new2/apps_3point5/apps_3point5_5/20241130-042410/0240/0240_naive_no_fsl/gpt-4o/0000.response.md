Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where leading zeroes are removed from the generated number. In the problem description, it is mentioned that the decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except when n is equal to zero itself. However, the program does not consider this condition and may generate a number with leading zeroes.
