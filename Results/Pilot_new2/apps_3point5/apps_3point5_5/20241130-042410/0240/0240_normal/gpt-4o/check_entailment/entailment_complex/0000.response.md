Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` uses `generate_possible_numbers` which is not defined in the provided code, leading to incomplete functionality. Additionally, the function `is_valid_number` lacks the calculation of the variable `n_len`, which is essential for determining the validity of the number. Both of these issues prevent the code from fully adhering to the problem description, making it incorrect.
