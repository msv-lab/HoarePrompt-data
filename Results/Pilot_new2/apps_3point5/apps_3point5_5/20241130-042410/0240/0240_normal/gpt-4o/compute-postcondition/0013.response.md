Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is the last valid number obtained by joining the permutations of `sub`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the `is_valid_number` function, then the program retains the initial state. If the loop does not execute, `candidate` is an empty string.**
