Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `sub` obtained by joining the permutation elements. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, then the overall postcondition is satisfied.***
