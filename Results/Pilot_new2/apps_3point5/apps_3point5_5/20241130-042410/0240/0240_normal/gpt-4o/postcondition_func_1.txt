The function `is_valid_number` takes two parameters, `num_str` and `sub`, where `num_str` is a string representing a large integer and `sub` is a substring that may contain leading zeroes. It returns True if the substring `sub` is found within `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`, otherwise it returns False. However, the code snippet provided does not include the definition or calculation of the variable `n_len`, which is essential for the function logic to be complete. It checks the presence of `sub` in `num_str` and their lengths but doesn't account for the discrepancy between `n_len` and the actual length of `num_str`. Additionally, the code snippet lacks the calculation of `n_len`, which is a crucial missing functionality.
