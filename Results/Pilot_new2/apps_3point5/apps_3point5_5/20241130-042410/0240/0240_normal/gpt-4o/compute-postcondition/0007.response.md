Example Answer:
The `candidate` string is yielded as the next permutation of the `sub` substring. The values of `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is the next permutation of `sub`**.
