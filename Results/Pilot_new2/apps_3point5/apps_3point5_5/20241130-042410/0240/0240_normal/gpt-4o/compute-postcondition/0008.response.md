Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `sub`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the function `is_valid_number`, then the function executes. Otherwise, there is no further action.***
