Correctness: **False**

The code is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the substring `sub` contains leading zeroes. The output hints mention that "the substring of n which Vasya remembers... can contain leading zeroes." Since the code does not account for this scenario, it fails to meet the problem description for every potential case. This is a critical oversight in the implementation that makes the code incorrect.
