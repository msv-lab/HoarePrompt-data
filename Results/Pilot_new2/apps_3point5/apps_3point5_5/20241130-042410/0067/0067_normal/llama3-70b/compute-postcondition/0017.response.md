Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x > y + z, then the program's state remains unchanged. If x is not greater than y + z, the following conditions apply: if x < y, the program's state remains unchanged. If x == y and z == 0, z remains 0. If x == y and z != 0, z is updated to a non-zero value. If x is not less than y, x is greater than or equal to y, and x is not greater than y + z, the program's state remains unchanged.***
