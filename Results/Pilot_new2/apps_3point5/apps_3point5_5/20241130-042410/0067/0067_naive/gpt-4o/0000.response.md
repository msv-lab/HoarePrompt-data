Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the given input values.
- It then checks for the three possible scenarios:
  1. If the maximum number of upvotes is less than the minimum number of downvotes, the result is "-" which is correct.
  2. If the maximum number of downvotes is less than the minimum number of upvotes, the result is "+" which is correct.
  3. If none of the above cases occur, the result is "?" which is also correct.
