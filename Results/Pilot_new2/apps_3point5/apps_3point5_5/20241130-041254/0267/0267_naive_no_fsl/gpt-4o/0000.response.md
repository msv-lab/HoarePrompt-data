Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from l to r such that each number contains at most k different digits.
2. The function func_1(n, k) correctly checks if a number n contains at most k different digits.
3. The function func_2(l, r, k) iterates through the numbers from l to r and adds the numbers that meet the condition of having at most k different digits to the total sum.
4. The program calculates the total sum modulo 998244353 as required.
5. The program correctly handles all potential cases within the given constraints.
6. The provided examples also demonstrate the correct output of the program.
