Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. 

For example, if we take $l = 10$, $r = 50$ and $k = 2$, the expected output is $1230$ as per the problem description. However, the program will output a different value. 

Therefore, based on the example provided, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
