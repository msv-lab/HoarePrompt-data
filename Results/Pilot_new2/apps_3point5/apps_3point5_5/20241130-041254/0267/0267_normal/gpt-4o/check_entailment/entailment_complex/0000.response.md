Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the provided code and the problem description, it is evident that the code correctly implements the logic required to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The func_1 function correctly checks if the number of unique digits in a given integer is less than or equal to k. The func_2 function iterates over all numbers in the range (l, r + 1) and appropriately sums up the numbers that satisfy the condition of func_1. The code also handles the modulo operation as required.

Additionally, the provided annotations accurately describe the state of the program before and after the function calls, and they align with the code logic and problem requirements. The examples provided in the problem description are consistent with the expected behavior of the code.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
