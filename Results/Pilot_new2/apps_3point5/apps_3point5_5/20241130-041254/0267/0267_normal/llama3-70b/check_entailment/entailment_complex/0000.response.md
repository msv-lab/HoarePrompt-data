Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count`, which work together to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, as described in the problem statement.
2. The `count` function correctly calculates the count of numbers divisible by `k` in the given range and stores the computed values in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
3. The `func_1` function then uses the `count` function to calculate the final sum modulo `998244353`, taking into account the difference between the counts for the given range.
4. The annotations provide insights into the state of the program before and after certain function calls, helping to understand the flow of the code and the logic behind the calculations.
5. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, such as checking if `k` is 0, updating the count for numbers greater than or equal to `10^k`, and returning the correct sum of numbers within the specified range.

Overall, based on analyzing the code, annotations, and problem description, the program appears to correctly solve the given problem and follows the requirements stated.
