Output State: **n is an integer such that 10^k <= n <= 10^18, dp is a dictionary to store computed values, k is not equal to 0, (n, k) is not in dp, (n >= 10 and dp[n, k] = 9), i is 2, dp[n, k] is updated to its previous value plus 9 * 10 ^ (i - 1) * (10 ^ (k - i) - 10 ^ (i - 1)), dp[n, k] is updated to its previous value plus 9 * 10 ** 1 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10 ** 1)**
