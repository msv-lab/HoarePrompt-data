Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary to store computed values. k is not equal to 0. The pair (n, k) is not in dp. If n < 10^k, dp[n, k] is equal to n. If n >= 10^k, dp[n, k] is updated with various calculations based on the values of n, k, and previous dp values.***
