Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program correctly reads the input string, iterates through each alphabet character from 'a' to 'z', and replaces the characters in the input string to form the subsequence 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It then checks if the length of the resulting string is 26, and if so, prints the string, otherwise prints -1. The program logic aligns with the problem description and works for all potential cases.
