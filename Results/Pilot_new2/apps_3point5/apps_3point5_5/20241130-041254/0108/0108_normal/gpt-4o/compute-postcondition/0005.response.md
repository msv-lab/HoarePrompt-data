Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, and `j` must be less than 26. If (s[i] == target[j]), then the character at index i in string s is equal to the character at index j in the target string.***
