According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are that `i` needs to be less than the length of `s` and `j` needs to be less than the length of `target`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
