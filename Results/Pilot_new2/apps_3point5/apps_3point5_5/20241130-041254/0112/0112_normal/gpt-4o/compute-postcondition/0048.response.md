According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. The initial state needs to be adjusted so that `i` starts at 0 and `n` is a positive integer. Additionally, since there are more digits left in the `digits` list, the list must have at least one more element. The `found` variable being False does not affect the loop execution.
State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` is a list where at least one element is True, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, there are more digits left in the `digits` list**
