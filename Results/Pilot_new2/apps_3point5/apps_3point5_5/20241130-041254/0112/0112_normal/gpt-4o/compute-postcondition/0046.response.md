According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If there are more digits to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is True, `used_cubes` list has at least one True element, `i` is between 0 and n-1, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more digits left in the list.
State: **`found` is True if there exists at least one `i` such that (not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]) is True, `used_cubes` is a list where at least one element is True, `i` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `n` is a positive integer, and there are more digits left in the `digits` list.**
