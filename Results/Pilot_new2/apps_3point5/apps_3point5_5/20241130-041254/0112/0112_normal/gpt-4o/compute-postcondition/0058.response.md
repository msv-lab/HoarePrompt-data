Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `used_cubes` is a list where elements at index other than i are True and `used_cubes[i]` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, there are more digits left in the `digits` list. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and digit is in cube_faces[i], then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
