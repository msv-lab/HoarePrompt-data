According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the list `cubes`. Since `cubes` is a list containing `n` sublists and 1 <= n <= 3, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is an empty set. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` sublists, and `digits` is an empty set.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` sublists, `digits` is an empty set**
