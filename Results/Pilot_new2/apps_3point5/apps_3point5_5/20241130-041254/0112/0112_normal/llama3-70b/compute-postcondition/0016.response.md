Functionality: **The function func reads an integer n followed by n cubes, each represented by a list of digits. It then creates a set of unique digits from all cubes, removes '0' if present, and finds the maximum number that can be formed using the digits from the cubes. The function prints this maximum number. The code does not handle cases where n is outside the range 1 to 3 or where the faces of the cubes contain digits other than 0 to 9.**
