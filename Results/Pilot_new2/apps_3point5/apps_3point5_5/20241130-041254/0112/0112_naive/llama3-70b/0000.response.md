Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if it exists, sorts the digits in descending order, and converts them to an integer to get the maximum number x that Masha can make. The logic used in the program adheres to the problem description provided. Additionally, for any input where the cubes have digits from 1 to 9 on different faces, the program will output the correct maximum number x.
