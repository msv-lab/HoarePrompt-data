Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input, converts it to the required format, and passes it to the `func_1` function.
2. The `func_1` function correctly checks if it is possible to form numbers from 1 to x using the given cubes based on the given conditions.
3. The program iterates through numbers incrementally starting from 1 and checks if it is possible to form the number using the cubes.
4. The program returns the maximum number x that can be formed using the cubes as per the problem description.
5. The program uses a brute-force approach to determine the maximum number that can be formed, which is a valid approach for this problem.
6. The program handles the edge cases such as not being able to form the number due to missing digits on the cubes.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic correctly for all potential cases. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
