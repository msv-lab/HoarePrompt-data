Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. 

The calculation `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` is incorrect. It should be `min_lemon + 2*min_lemon + 4*min_lemon`.

Additionally, the program should handle cases where Nikolay does not have enough pears to cook any compote by printing 0. However, the program does not check for this condition.

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
