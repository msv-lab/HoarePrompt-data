Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It ensures that the fruits are used in the ratio 1:2:4 as specified in the problem description. The logic of determining the maximum number of lemons based on the number of apples and pears is correctly implemented. The program also handles cases where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote and outputs 0 in such cases. Overall, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
