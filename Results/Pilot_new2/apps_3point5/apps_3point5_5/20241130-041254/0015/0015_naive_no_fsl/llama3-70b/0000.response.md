Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program checks if the difference between the favorite number b and the starting number a is divisible evenly by c and if the result is non-negative. This logic correctly determines if the favorite number b appears in the sequence as described in the problem statement.
2. The program also correctly handles the case where the difference between neighboring elements is 0, by directly checking if a is equal to b and printing 'YES'.
