Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The values of b and a are not equal. c is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition, (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative.***
