Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. The current value of `c` is equal to 0. If `a` is equal to `b`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `a` is not equal to `b`, the code prints 'NO' and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
