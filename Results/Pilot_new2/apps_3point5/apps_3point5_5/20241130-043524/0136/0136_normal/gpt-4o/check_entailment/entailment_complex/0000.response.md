Correctness: **True**

The program takes two non-negative integers represented as strings, removes any leading zeros, and then compares the numbers. It correctly prints "<" if the first number is less than the second, ">" if the first number is greater than the second, and "=" if the numbers are equal. The program follows the problem description and handles the input size constraint of up to 10^6 digits for each number. The logic of comparing the lengths of the numbers and then comparing them digit by digit ensures that the correct output is generated for all cases.
