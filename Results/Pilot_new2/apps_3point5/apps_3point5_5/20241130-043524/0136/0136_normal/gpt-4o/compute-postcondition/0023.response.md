Postcondition: ***a is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits. If a is less than b, b is assigned the value of the string at index 1 of the list data after removing leading zeros if a is false or b was already assigned a value. The length of a is greater than or equal to the length of b and the length of a is less than or equal to the length of b. The condition (a < b) is true, indicating that a is less than b. Therefore, the output is '<'. If a is not less than b, then a is greater than or equal to b and b is assigned the value of the string at index 1 of the list data after removing leading zeros if a is false or b was already assigned a value.***
