Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; MOD is assigned the value 10^6 + 3; total_days is equal to 2^n; numerator is assigned the value `(total_days - i) * numerator % MOD`; denominator is assigned the value `total_days * total_days % MOD`; `i` is increased by 1; `k` must be greater than the new value of `i`; numerator is assigned the value `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`**
