Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; MOD is assigned the value 10^6 + 3; total_days is equal to 2^n; numerator is equal to `(total_days - k) * (total_days - k + 1) * ... * (total_days - 1) % MOD`; denominator is equal to `total_days * (total_days - 1) * ... * 2 % MOD`; `i` is equal to `k`; `k` is greater than or equal to 2; `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`; `p_total` is equal to `denominator`; `p_shared` is equal to `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`**.
