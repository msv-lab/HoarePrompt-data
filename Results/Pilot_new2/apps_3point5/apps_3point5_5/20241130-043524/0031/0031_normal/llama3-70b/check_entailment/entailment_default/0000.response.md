Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The problem states that ZS the Coder wants to find the probability of at least two people having the same birthday. However, the code only calculates the probability that exactly k people have different birthdays. This means that the code does not consider the scenario where at least two people share the same birthday, leading to an incorrect output. 

Therefore, the code needs to be modified to consider the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in order to fully adhere to the problem description.
