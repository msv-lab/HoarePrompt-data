Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. `s` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input split by spaces. `min_buy_price` is equal to the minimum value in list `s`. `max_sell_price` is equal to the maximum value in list `b`. The current value of `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`.***
