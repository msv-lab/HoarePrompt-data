Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `shares` is updated to include the result of `r` divided by `s[i]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, otherwise no update is made to `shares`. `r` is updated where `r` is assigned the value of `r` modulo `s[i]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, otherwise `r` remains unchanged. If the condition `r >= s[i]` is true, the program continues to update `shares` and `r`, otherwise it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
