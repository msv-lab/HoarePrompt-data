Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input and handles the lists of buying and selling prices.
- It sorts the buying prices in ascending order and the selling prices in descending order, as required.
- It iterates through the buying prices and calculates the total number of shares that can be bought based on the remaining money.
- Then, it iterates through the selling prices and updates the money based on the shares sold.
- The final value of money (bourles) after all transactions is printed, which is the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.
- The code works as expected for all cases described in the problem statement.
