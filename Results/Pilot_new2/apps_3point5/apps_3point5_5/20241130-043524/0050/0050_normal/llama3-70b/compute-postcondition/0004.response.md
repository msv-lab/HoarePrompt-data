Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000 after assigning values from input split. `s` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split to integers and has been sorted. `b` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split to integers and sorted in descending order.**
