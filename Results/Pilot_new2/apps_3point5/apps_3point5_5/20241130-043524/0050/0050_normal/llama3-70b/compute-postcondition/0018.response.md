According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time:
- If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` should be updated by adding the integer division of `r` divided by `s[i]`.
- `r` should be updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`.
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `shares` should be updated, `r` should be updated**
