According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is k-1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to k-2 as it decrements by 1 each iteration.
State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2 and min_sum is less than or equal to n; d is n divided by min_sum; remainder is n - d * min_sum - 1; sequence is a list of values where each value is d times the index plus 1 for indices ranging from 0 to k-1, i is k-2; sequence[i] is incremented by 1**
