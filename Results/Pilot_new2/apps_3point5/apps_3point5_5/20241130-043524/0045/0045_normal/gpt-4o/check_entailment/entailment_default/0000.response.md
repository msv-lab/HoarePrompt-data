Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input and calculates a minimum sum using `k`. 
- It then checks if the minimum sum exceeds `n`, and if it does, returns -1.
- If the conditions are met, it calculates a list 'sequence' where each value is derived based on specific calculations for indices ranging from 0 to k-1, and returns this list.
- The code seems to be following the problem description accurately and the output hints also support the functionality described in the problem. 
- The code handles cases where the answer exists and outputs a valid sequence, and also handles the case where there is no possible sequence by outputting -1.
