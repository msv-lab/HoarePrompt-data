The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. After executing the function body, the program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of n and k.**
