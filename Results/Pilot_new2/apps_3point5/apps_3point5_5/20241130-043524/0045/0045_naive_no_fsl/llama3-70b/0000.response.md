Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input for n and k.
2. It then checks if n is less than k, it prints -1.
3. Otherwise, it creates a sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal.
4. It iterates through the range of 1 to k+1, adding numbers to the sequence until n is exhausted.
5. If the resulting sequence is not of length k, it prints -1.
6. Otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence.
7. The logic of the program ensures that the output sequence is strictly increasing, sums up to n, and the greatest common divisor is maximal.
