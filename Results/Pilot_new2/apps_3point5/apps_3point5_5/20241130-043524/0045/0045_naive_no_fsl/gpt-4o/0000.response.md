Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers by using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`.
2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than n, in which case it returns -1.
3. It calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by min_sum.
4. It calculates the remainder by subtracting d * min_sum from n.
5. It then creates the sequence of k positive numbers by multiplying d with increasing numbers from 1 to k.
6. The function handles any remaining remainder by distributing it among the sequence in reverse order.
7. The main program reads the input, calls the function, and prints the resulting sequence or -1 if no valid sequence is possible.
8. The logic of the program seems correct and it covers all possible cases as per the problem description.
