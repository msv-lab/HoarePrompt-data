Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The condition (x <= y + z) is true. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` is less than `y` and the initial conditions are retained. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, several cases arise: if `x` is equal to `y` and z == 0, then after the execution, `z` is set to 0. If z is not equal to 0, then `x` is still equal to `y`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and z is not equal to 0. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the relationship `x <= y` is maintained.***
