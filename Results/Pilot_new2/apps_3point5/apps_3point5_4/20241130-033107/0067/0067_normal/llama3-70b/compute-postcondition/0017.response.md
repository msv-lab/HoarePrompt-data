Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. The initial conditions are retained. In the case where x > y + z, the '+' symbol is printed without affecting the variable values. In the else part, if `x` is less than `y`, the relationship is maintained, and the initial conditions are retained. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` == 0, then after execution, `z` is set to 0. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not equal to 0, the conditions ensure that `x`, `y`, and `z` remain as non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `z` is not equal to 0. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the relationship `x <= y` is maintained.***
