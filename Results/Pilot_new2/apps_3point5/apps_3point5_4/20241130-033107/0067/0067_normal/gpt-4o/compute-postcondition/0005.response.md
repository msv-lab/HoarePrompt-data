Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. `x`, `y`, `z` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input split operation. `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The current values of `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` are such that `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes` based on the if condition. The current value of `min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes` are the same as before.***
