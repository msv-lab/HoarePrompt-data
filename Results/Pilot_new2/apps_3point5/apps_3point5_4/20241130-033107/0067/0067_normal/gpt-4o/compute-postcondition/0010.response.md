Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100 and are assigned the integer values obtained from the input split operation. `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false, meaning max_upvotes is greater than or equal to min_downvotes. Additionally, (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) is false, meaning max_downvotes is greater than or equal to min_upvotes.***
