Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of only English letters. `n` is an even number greater than 2(i + 1), where the characters at index `i + 2` and `n - 1 - (i + 2)` in string `s` are equal. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the program.***
