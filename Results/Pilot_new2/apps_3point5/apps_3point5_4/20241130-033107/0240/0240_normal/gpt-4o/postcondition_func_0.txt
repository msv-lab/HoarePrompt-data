The function func_1 accepts two parameters, a string `s` representing a very large integer and a substring `sub` of `s`. It then calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters in `sub`. It generates possible numbers using the remaining characters and `sub`, then returns the smallest number from the list `possible_numbers` based on their integer values. If the code executes correctly, it accurately finds the smallest number from the list.
