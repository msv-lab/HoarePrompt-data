Postcondition: ***chars is a string of digits with length at least 1, sub is a valid substring of chars, perm is the next permutation of chars, candidate is formed by joining the next permutation of chars, candidate is a valid number with the sub string, and candidate has been yielded. If candidate is a valid number with the substring, then the program executes the if block. There is no else part in the code.***
