According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more permutations of the characters in the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string of digits with length at least 1, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with the substring. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated.
State: **chars is a string of digits with length at least 1, sub is a valid substring of chars, perm is the next permutation of chars, candidate is the string formed by joining the next permutation of chars, and candidate is a valid number with the sub string. If candidate is a valid number with the substring, then candidate has been yielded.**
