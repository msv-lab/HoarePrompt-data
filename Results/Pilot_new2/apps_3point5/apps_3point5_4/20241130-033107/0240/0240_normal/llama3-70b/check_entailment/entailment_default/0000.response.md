Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters `s` and `t`, where `s` is a string representing a very large integer, and `t` is a substring of `s`. The code iterates through each character in `s`, checks if it exists in the set of characters in `t`, and appends it to a new string `n`. Finally, it concatenates `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of the resulting string. This approach effectively filters out characters from `s` that are also in `t` and returns the smallest integer that Vasya could pass to Kate, which matches the problem description. 

Since all the examples provided are working correctly, we can conclude that the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
