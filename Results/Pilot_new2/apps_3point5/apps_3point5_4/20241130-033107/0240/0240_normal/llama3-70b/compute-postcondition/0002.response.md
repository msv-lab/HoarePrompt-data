According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over. Therefore, the loop will execute if the string `s` is not empty. Additionally, the loop does not depend on the values of `t`, `t_set`, or `n`, so they can remain unchanged. Hence, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `s` should not be an empty string.
State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer that is not empty, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is an empty string**
