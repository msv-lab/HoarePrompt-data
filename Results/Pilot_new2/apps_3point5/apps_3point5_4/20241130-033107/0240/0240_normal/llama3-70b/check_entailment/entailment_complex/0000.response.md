Correctness: **True**

The program clearly follows the problem description. It takes a very large integer `s` and a substring `t` as input. It then iterates through each character in `s`, filters out the characters that are also in `t`, and concatenates `t` to the filtered characters to form the smallest possible integer `n`. The program returns the correct output as specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
