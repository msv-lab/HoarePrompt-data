Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. One potential case where the program may fail is when the substring consists of leading zeroes. The program does not handle the case where the substring contains leading zeroes, which may lead to incorrect output. For example:
Input:
003512
021

Expected Output:
30021

Actual Output:
300021

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails to provide the correct output for the case where the substring contains leading zeroes.
