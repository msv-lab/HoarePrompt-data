Output State: After the loop executes, each color in `current_counts` must have a value greater than or equal to the corresponding desired count except for at least one color, `left` is incremented by the total number of iterations, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is increased by the total number of iterations, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by the total number of iterations. If all colors in `current_counts` match the desired counts, the program returns 'YES'.
