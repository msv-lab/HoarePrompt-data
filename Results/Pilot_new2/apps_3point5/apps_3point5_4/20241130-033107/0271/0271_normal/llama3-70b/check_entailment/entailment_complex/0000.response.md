Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n` from the user input and then checks if `n` is divisible by 10. If it is, the program prints the value of `n` itself. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it then checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. If true, it prints `n - n % 10`, which is the nearest integer ending with 0. If false, it prints `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which is also a valid result according to the problem description.

The program covers all possible cases outlined in the problem description and prints the correct output for each case.
