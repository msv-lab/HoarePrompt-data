This function `func` takes user input as a non-negative integer `n` with the constraint 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10 and based on this remainder, it computes a result. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is n minus the remainder; otherwise, the result is n plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. The function then prints the calculated result.
