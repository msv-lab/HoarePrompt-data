Functionality: ** The function `func` takes input from the user: a positive integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string of characters representing fractions of employees (where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats). It then calculates the count of 'D' and 'R' fractions. After that, it determines the majority political party among the employees based on the counts. If the count of 'D' fractions is greater than the count of 'R' fractions, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'.**
