You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n employees in Alternative Cake Manufacturing (ACM). They are now voting on some very important question and the leading world media are trying to predict the outcome of the vote.

Each of the employees belongs to one of two fractions: depublicans or remocrats, and these two fractions have opposite opinions on what should be the outcome of the vote. The voting procedure is rather complicated:   Each of n employees makes a statement. They make statements one by one starting from employees 1 and finishing with employee n. If at the moment when it's time for the i-th employee to make a statement he no longer has the right to vote, he just skips his turn (and no longer takes part in this voting).  When employee makes a statement, he can do nothing or declare that one of the other employees no longer has a right to vote. It's allowed to deny from voting people who already made the statement or people who are only waiting to do so. If someone is denied from voting he no longer participates in the voting till the very end.  When all employees are done with their statements, the procedure repeats: again, each employees starting from 1 and finishing with n who are still eligible to vote make their statements.  The process repeats until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining and he determines the outcome of the whole voting. Of course, he votes for the decision suitable for his fraction. 

You know the order employees are going to vote and that they behave optimal (and they also know the order and who belongs to which fraction). Predict the outcome of the vote.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of employees. 

The next line contains n characters. The i-th character is 'D' if the i-th employee is from depublicans fraction or 'R' if he is from remocrats.


-----Output-----

Print 'D' if the outcome of the vote will be suitable for depublicans and 'R' if remocrats will win.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
DDRRR

Output
D

Input
6
DDRRRR

Output
R



-----Note-----

Consider one of the voting scenarios for the first sample:   Employee 1 denies employee 5 to vote.  Employee 2 denies employee 3 to vote.  Employee 3 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 2).  Employee 4 denies employee 2 to vote.  Employee 5 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 1).  Employee 1 denies employee 4.  Only employee 1 now has the right to vote so the voting ends with the victory of depublicans.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, and the characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R'.**
def func():
    n = int(input())
    votes = input().strip()
    d_queue = []
    r_queue = []
    for (i, v) in enumerate(votes):
        if v == 'D':
            d_queue.append(i)
        else:
            r_queue.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty. d_queue contains the indices of employees who voted 'D' in the order they appear in the string, r_queue contains the indices of employees who voted 'R' in the order they appear in the string.
    while d_queue and r_queue:
        d_index = d_queue.pop(0)
        
        r_index = r_queue.pop(0)
        
        if d_index < r_index:
            d_queue.append(d_index + n)
        else:
            r_queue.append(r_index + n)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is a positive integer, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty. After all iterations of the loop, either d_queue or r_queue will be empty. If d_queue is empty, then all employees who voted 'D' have been paired with employees who voted 'R' based on their indices. If r_queue is empty, then all employees who voted 'R' have been paired with employees who voted 'D' based on their indices. The specific pairing order may vary depending on the values of d_index and r_index in each iteration of the loop.
    if d_queue :
        print('D')
    else :
        print('R')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is a positive integer. Characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R'. Votes is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty. After all iterations of the loop, either d_queue or r_queue will be empty. If d_queue is empty, then all employees who voted 'D' have been paired with employees who voted 'R' based on their indices. If r_queue is empty, then all employees who voted 'R' have been paired with employees who voted 'D' based on their indices. The specific pairing order may vary depending on the values of d_index and r_index in each iteration of the loop. After the execution of the if else block, either all employees who voted 'D' have been paired with employees who voted 'R' based on their indices (if d_queue was empty) or all employees who voted 'R' have been paired with employees who voted 'D' based on their indices (if r_queue was empty). The program prints 'D' if d_queue is not empty, otherwise it prints 'R'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input string representing the political affiliation of employees, then pairs employees who voted 'D' and 'R' based on their indices. If there are more employees who voted 'D', it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
