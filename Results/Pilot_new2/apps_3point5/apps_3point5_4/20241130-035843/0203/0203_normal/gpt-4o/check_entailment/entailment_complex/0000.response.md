Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input string representing the political affiliation of employees, pairs employees who voted 'D' and 'R' based on their indices, and determines the outcome of the vote based on the remaining employees in the queues. The logic of denying voting rights to employees and the voting process is correctly implemented. 

The program ensures that only one employee is left eligible to vote at the end, and that employee will determine the outcome of the vote based on their fraction. It handles all cases where employees deny others the right to vote and skips those who are denied. Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct outcome.
