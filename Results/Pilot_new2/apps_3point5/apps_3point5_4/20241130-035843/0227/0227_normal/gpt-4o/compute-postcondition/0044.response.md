According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is False, `m` has been incremented by 1, and `assigned` contains the element `a[i]`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, and `assigned` should contain the next element in the list `a`. 
State: **All variables are positive integers, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `can_form` is False, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains the next element in the list `a`, `i` is increased by 1**
