According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `assigned` list. The `assigned` list is formed from elements of `a` up to index `i+1`, so for the loop to execute, `assigned` must have at least 1 element. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `n`, `x`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i` remain positive integers, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least 1 element, and `can_form` remains False.
State: **`n`, `x`, `a`, `assigned` contains at least 1 element, `m`, `i` are all positive integers. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. `can_form` is False**.
