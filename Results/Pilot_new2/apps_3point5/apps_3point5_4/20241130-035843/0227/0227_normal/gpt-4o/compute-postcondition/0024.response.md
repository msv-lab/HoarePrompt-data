According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a certain positive integer value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `x`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i` are all positive integers. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. `assigned` contains all elements of `a` up to index `i+1`.**
