The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of n distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order and iterates through the elements to determine how many times `can_form` was False. If there exists a pair of elements in the 'assigned' set such that their difference equals any element in `a`, `can_form` is set to True; otherwise, it remains False. The function returns the count of how many times `can_form` was False during the iteration.
