    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `x`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i` are all positive integers. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. If there exists a pair of elements in `assigned` such that the difference between them is equal to any element in the list `a`, `can_form` is True. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. After all iterations, `m` contains the number of times `can_form` was False, and `assigned` contains all elements of list `a`.
    return m
    #The program returns the number of times `can_form` was False after iterating through the elements in `assigned` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of n distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order and iterates through the elements to determine how many times `can_form` was False. If there exists a pair of elements in the 'assigned' set such that their difference equals any element in `a`, `can_form` is set to True; otherwise, it remains False. The function returns the count of how many times `can_form` was False during the iteration.
