Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains the next element in the list `a`, `i` is increased by 1, `assigned` must have at least two elements, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, the current value of `a[i] - x` is in `assigned, `can_form` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
