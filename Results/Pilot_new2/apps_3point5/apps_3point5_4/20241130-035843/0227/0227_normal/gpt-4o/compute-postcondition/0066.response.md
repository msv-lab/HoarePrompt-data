The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct positive integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of times `can_form` was False after iterating through the elements in the `assigned` list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers `a`, and return the number of times `can_form` was False after iterating through the elements in the `assigned` list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of n distinct positive integers a, then returns the number of times `can_form` was False after iterating through the elements in the assigned list.**
