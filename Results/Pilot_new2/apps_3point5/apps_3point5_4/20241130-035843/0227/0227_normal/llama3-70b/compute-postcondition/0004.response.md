According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer already meets this condition. The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, so the loop will execute n-1 times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, n must be greater than 1, i is 1, and m is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is 1**
