According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is 3, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`. Since `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, no adjustment is needed for `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `m` is 3, `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1] * 2**
