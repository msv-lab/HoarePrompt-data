Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the sequence of operations described in the problem. It does so by sorting the input sequence `a` and iterating through it to check if each number is equal to twice the previous number. If it is not, the variable `m` is incremented. Finally, the program prints the value of `m` unless it exceeds 23, in which case it prints -1 as specified in the problem description.

The program always follows the problem description for any input case since it iterates through the sorted sequence `a` and checks the condition for each number to determine the minimum number of variables needed.
