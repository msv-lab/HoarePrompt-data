Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by each number from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits, otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This matches the requirements of the problem description, ensuring that all remainders are distinct. The code logic is sound and covers all possible cases, making it a correct implementation.
