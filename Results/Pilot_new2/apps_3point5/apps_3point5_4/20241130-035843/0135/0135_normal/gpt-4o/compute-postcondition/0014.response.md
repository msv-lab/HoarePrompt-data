Output State: **n >= k+1, k < n+1, seen_remainders is a set containing values of n modulo i where remainder is not in seen_remainders and remainder is the value of n modulo i. If the remainder is in seen_remainders, the program returns the string 'No'. If remainder is not in seen_remainders, it is added to seen_remainders.**
