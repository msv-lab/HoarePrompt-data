Correctness: **True**

Upon initial assessment, the code seems to be following the problem description as it checks if k is greater than or equal to n and returns 'No' in that case. It then iterates through the range [1, k] to calculate the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is repeated, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The code appears to cover all the cases mentioned in the problem description and seems to handle the logic correctly.

The output hints also confirm that the code is in line with the problem description. The function `func_1` effectively checks if all the remainders are distinct, ensuring that there are no duplicate remainders in the specified range [1, k]. The hints align with the code functionalities, providing an additional level of assurance that the code is correct.

Therefore, based on the code logic and the output hints, it can be concluded that the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
