Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at index 8 of the list `data`, `s` is assigned the integer value at index 10 of the list `data`, `balance` is equal to the result of subtracting the count of '1's in `s` from the count of '0's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the differences between the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i - 1` in `s`. If after these conditions are met, the balance equals 0.***
