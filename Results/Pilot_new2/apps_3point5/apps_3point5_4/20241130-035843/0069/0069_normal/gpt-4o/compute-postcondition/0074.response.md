Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at index 8 of the list `data`, `s` is assigned the integer value at index 10 of the list `data`, `balance` is equal to the result of subtracting the count of '1's in `s` from the count of '0's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the differences between the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i - 1` in `s`. If the balance equals 0, after entering the if condition, `x` is an integer, `s` is an integer, `balance` equals 0 and `prefix_balances` remains a list with the described properties, and `results` contains -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise `results` contains 0. If balance is not equal to 0, after appending the value of `count` to `results`, the state remains the same as before the code execution: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the integer value at index 8 of the list `data`, `s` is the integer value at index 10 of the list `data`, `balance` is equal to the result of subtracting the count of '1's in `s` from the count of '0's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the differences between the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i - 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is the total number of times the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` are satisfied during the loop execution.***
