Postcondition: ***s is a string of length n, n is an input integer, x is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, T must be greater than 0, cnt0 is the number of occurrences of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the number of occurrences of '1' in string s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1. The balance is not equal to x. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) != 0, and print((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is executed.***
