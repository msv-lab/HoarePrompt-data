Postcondition: ***s is an input string, n is an input integer (increased by 1), x is an input integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, T is greater than 1, cnt0 is the number of occurrences of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the number of occurrences of '1' in string s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, the program executes the if part where n + 1 is printed. Otherwise, the program executes the else part where (x - balance) is divided by cnt0 - cnt1, 1 is added to the result, and then it is printed.***
