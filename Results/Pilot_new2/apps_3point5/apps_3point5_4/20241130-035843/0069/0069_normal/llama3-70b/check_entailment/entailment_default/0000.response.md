Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `s`, the desired balance `x`, and the binary string `s`.
- It correctly calculates the balance of 0s and 1s in the string.
- It then checks three conditions as described in the problem:
  1. If the balance equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`.
  2. If a certain condition involving `x` and the balance holds, it prints -1.
  3. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the result based on the given formula.
- The code handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
