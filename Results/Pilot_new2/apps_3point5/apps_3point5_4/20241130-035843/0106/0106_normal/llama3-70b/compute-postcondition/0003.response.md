Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. `a` is assigned the first integer obtained from the input, and `b` is assigned the second integer obtained from the input. `a_floor` is calculated as ((first integer obtained from the input) - 1) % (second integer obtained from the input) + 1. `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
