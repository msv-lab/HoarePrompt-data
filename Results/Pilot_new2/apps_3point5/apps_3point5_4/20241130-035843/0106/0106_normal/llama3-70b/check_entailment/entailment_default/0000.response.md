Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes input values for the number of blocks, floors, and apartments per floor, as well as the apartment numbers for Edward and Natasha. It then calculates the individual floor and block numbers for both Edward and Natasha. Based on these values, it calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha by considering the differences in block and floor numbers, as well as the predetermined time for moving between blocks and floors.

The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly handles the movement of Edward within the circular building, including using the elevator, as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the code logic is consistent with the examples provided in the problem description, making it a correct implementation for the given problem.
