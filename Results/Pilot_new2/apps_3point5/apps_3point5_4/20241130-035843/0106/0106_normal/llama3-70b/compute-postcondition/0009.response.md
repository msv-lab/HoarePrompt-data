Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. `a` is assigned the first integer obtained from the input, and `b` is assigned the second integer obtained from the input. `a_floor` is calculated as ((first integer obtained from the input) - 1) % (second integer obtained from the input) + 1. `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1. `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1. `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum value between the absolute difference of a_block and b_block, and n minus the absolute difference of a_block and b_block, multiplied by 15. Additionally, a_floor is less than or equal to b_floor***
