Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the provided problem description. The program correctly calculates the floor and block numbers for both Edward and Natasha's apartments. It then determines the minimum time required to move between blocks and floors and calculates the total minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. The logic implemented in the program follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. Hence, the program is correct.
