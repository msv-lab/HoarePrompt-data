Output State: **N is at least 2, gcd and max_divisor are positive integers. If gcd % i == 0 and i * i != gcd, max_divisor is equal to max(max_divisor, gcd // 2). Otherwise, max_divisor is a positive integer equal to max(max_divisor, gcd // (i-1)). i is incremented by 1. max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between max_divisor and i.**
