Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing the divisors of x, x is a perfect square. If x is divisible by i, divisors will be updated to include x divided by i for each i in divisors. The set divisors is updated to add the integer i.**
