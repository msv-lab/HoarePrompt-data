The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. The function has multiple return cases based on the value of `n`:

Case_1: If `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the 'ones' list.
Case_2: If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string value representing `n` from the 'teens' list.
Case_3: If `n` is between 10 and 99 and divisible by 10, the function returns the element at index `n // 10` from the 'tens' list.
Case_4: If `n` is between 10 and 99 but does not fall into the above cases, the function returns the string representation of `n` using the 'tens' and 'ones' lists.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` between 0 and 99 and return the appropriate string representation based on the value of `n` according to the specified cases.
