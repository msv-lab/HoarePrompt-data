Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always provide the correct output for all potential cases. An example case where it fails is as follows:

Input:
3
2 1 3

Output:
2

Explanation:
In this case, the minimum element 1 and the maximum element 3 are already at maximum possible distance with distance 2. However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. This shows that the program does not work as expected for all cases.
