Output State: **n is an input integer between 2 and 100; a is a list of integers obtained from the input(); pos1 is the index of the integer 1 in list a; posn is the index of integer n in list a; max_dist is equal to the maximum value between the absolute difference of pos1 and posn minus 1 and n - 2; min_dist is equal to the minimum value between the absolute difference of pos1 and posn minus 1 and n - 2. The code calculates the maximum value between max_dist and n - 1 - min_dist and prints it.**
