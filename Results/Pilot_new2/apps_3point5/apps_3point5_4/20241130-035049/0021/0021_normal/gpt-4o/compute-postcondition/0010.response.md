The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function utilizes the constraints provided: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n. The function does not have any explicit return value specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to perform operations based on the constraints given for n and a, but it does not explicitly return any value.
