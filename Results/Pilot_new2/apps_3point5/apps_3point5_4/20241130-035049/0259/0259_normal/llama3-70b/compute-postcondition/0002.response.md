According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is already a positive integer between 1 and 100, so no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, since `buses` is an empty list, it needs to be specified that the list `buses` will contain at least one element after the loop execution.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is a list that will contain at least one element after the loop execution**
