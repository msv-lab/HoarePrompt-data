According to the code, the loop executes based on the list `buses`. To execute one more time, the list `buses` must have at least `i + 2` elements. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least 2 elements with the tuple `(s, d)`, `min_time` is updated to the current value of `time`, `ans` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is the index of the next tuple in `buses`, `s` and `d` are the values from the next tuple in `buses`, `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d` after the if statement executed.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least `i + 2` elements with tuples `(s, d)`, `min_time` is updated to the current value of `time`, `ans` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is the index of the next tuple in `buses`, `s` and `d` are the values from the next tuple in `buses`, `time` is updated to `(t - s) % d`**.
