Postcondition: ***`n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i, s_i, d_i` are all positive integers. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is 0, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. If the current value of `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to that value and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`.***
