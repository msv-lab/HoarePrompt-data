You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).


-----Output-----

Print the k-rounding of n.


-----Examples-----
Input
375 4

Output
30000

Input
10000 1

Output
10000

Input
38101 0

Output
38101

Input
123456789 8

Output
12345678900000000
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer.**
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    x = 10 ** k
    while n % x != 0:
        n += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'n' is such that 'n % x' is equal to 0
    print(n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`, then increments `n` until it is divisible by `x`. After that, it prints out the final value of `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and has no return value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
