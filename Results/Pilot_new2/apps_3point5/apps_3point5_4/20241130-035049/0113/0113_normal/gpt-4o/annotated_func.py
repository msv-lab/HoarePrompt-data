#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition
**n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8.**
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns the positive integer 'n' which was initially assigned to variable 'x'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, a positive integer n and an integer k within the range of 0 to 8. It calculates the value of x by multiplying n with a value derived from multiplier, which is computed based on n and k. The function then returns the positive integer n assigned to variable x. The function assumes that k will always be within the range of 0 to 8 and that n will be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
