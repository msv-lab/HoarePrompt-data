The function func_1 accepts two parameters, a positive integer n and an integer k within the range of 0 to 8. It calculates the value of x by multiplying n with a value derived from multiplier, which is computed based on n and k. The function then returns the positive integer n assigned to variable x. The function assumes that k will always be within the range of 0 to 8 and that n will be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
