Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It checks if the minimum sum is greater than the given number n, and returns -1 if true.
3. It then calculates the value of d, which is n divided by the minimum sum.
4. It calculates the remainder by subtracting d * min_sum from n.
5. It generates the sequence by multiplying each element of the sequence by d, and then distributing the remainder to the elements in a decreasing order.
6. Finally, it outputs the resulting sequence or -1 if no possible sequence exists.

The program handles the logic as described in the problem statement and generates a strictly increasing sequence with the maximum possible greatest common divisor. The code also outputs -1 if there is no possible sequence, as per the requirements. The examples provided in the problem description also produce the correct output. Thus, the program is correct.
