#State of the program right berfore the function call: # Precondition
**n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10.**
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to k * (k + 1) // 2. The minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, and `i` remain the same as the initial state. The `remainder` will be 0. The `sequence` list will contain `k` elements where each element is equal to the original `d` times (i + 1) for i in range(k).
    return sequence
    #The program returns a list `sequence` containing `k` elements where each element is equal to the original `d` times (i + 1) for i in range(k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^10. If the minimum sum calculated based on parameter `k` exceeds `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function constructs a list `sequence` containing `k` elements. Each element in the list is equal to the original `d` multiplied by (i + 1) for i in range(k). The functionality correctly handles the case where the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n` and constructs the `sequence` list accordingly.
