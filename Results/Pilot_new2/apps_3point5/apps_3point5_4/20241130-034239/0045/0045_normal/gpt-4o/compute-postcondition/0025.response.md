The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints for `n` and `k` are that they are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10. 

If the constraints are violated, the program returns -1. 

Otherwise, if the constraints are satisfied, the program returns a list `sequence` containing `k` elements. Each element in the list is equal to the original `n` multiplied by (i + 1) for i in range(k). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return -1 if the constraints are violated. If the constraints are satisfied, it returns a list of `k` elements where each element is equal to the original `n` times (i + 1) for i in range(k).
