Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening based on the morning buying prices and evening selling prices. It first finds the minimum buying price and maximum selling price. If all the selling prices are less than or equal to the buying prices, then it simply prints the bourles held in the morning (r), which is correct. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the available bourles and then calculates the total bourles that can be held after selling those shares in the evening, which is also correct. The logic accounts for all possible scenarios and correctly calculates the maximum bourles that can be held after the evening.
