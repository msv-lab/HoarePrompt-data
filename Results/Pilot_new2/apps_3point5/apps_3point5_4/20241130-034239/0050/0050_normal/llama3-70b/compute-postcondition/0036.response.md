According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and it should be less than `m`.
State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `r` is updated to its previous value plus the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to n+1, `shares` is set to 0**.
