Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `r` is updated to its previous value plus the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to n, `shares` is set to 0. If shares > 0, `r` is updated to its previous value plus the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, if shares <= 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
