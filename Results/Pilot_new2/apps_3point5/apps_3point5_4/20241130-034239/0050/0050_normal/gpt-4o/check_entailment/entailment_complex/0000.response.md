Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `r`, as well as lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the initial value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the total bourles correctly by determining the maximum number of shares that can be bought at the minimum price, the remaining bourles after purchasing those shares, and then adding the profit from selling those shares at the maximum price.

The program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all potential cases.
