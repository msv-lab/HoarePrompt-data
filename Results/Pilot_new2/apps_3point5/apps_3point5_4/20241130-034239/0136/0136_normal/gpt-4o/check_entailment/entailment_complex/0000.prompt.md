You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits.**
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *a, b are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If a is '0', then 'a' evaluates to False after entering the if condition. Otherwise, there is no change to the values of 'a' and 'b'.
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *a, b are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0' (string representation of zero), then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. Otherwise, no change in the values of 'a' and 'b' occurs.
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *'a', 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b'. The condition (a >= b) is true. If 'a' is greater than 'b', the function will execute the if part, otherwise, it will execute the else part. In the if part, 'a' and 'b' remain unchanged. In the else part, 'a' and 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b'. The condition (a >= b) is true, and 'a' is not greater than 'b'.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *'a', 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b'. If 'a' is less than 'b', no change occurs in 'a' and 'b'. If 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b', 'a' and 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b'. The condition (a >= b) is true, and 'a' is not greater than 'b'.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *'a', 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b'. If the length of 'a' is greater than the length of 'b', the program executes the if part. If the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b', the program executes the else part. In the if part, the current length of 'a' is greater than the length of 'b' and if 'a' is less than 'b', no change occurs in 'a' and 'b'. If 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b', 'a' and 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros, where 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False, and 'a' is not greater than 'b'.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *'a', 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is either less than the length of 'b' or greater than or equal to it. If the length of 'a' is less than the length of 'b', no change occurs in 'a' and 'b'. If the length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b', and 'a' is less than 'b', no change occurs in 'a' and 'b'. If 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b', 'a' and 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False and 'a' is not greater than 'b'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two non-negative integers, a and b, from input. It removes leading zeros from both a and b. If a is '0', it is converted to the integer 0. If b is '0', it is also converted to the integer 0. It then compares the values of a and b. If a is less than b, it prints '<'. If a is greater than b, it prints '>'. If a is equal to b, it prints '='. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specified return value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
