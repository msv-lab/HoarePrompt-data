Functionality: **The function reads two non-negative integers, a and b, from input. It removes leading zeros from both a and b. If a is '0', it is converted to the integer 0. If b is '0', it is also converted to the integer 0. It then compares the values of a and b. If a is less than b, it prints '<'. If a is greater than b, it prints '>'. If a is equal to b, it prints '='. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specified return value.**
