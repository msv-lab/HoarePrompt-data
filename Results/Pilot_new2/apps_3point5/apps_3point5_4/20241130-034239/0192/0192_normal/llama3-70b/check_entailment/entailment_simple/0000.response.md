Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes two integers x and y as input, representing the initial and final side lengths of the equilateral triangle. It then calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the initial side length x.

The program always outputs the correct result as it follows the logic provided in the problem description for all potential cases. It ensures that the triangle remains non-degenerate and the length of each side is an integer throughout the process, which is a requirement mentioned in the problem description.
