The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` based on the given formula. Then, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`, and updates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` accordingly. Finally, it returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3).
