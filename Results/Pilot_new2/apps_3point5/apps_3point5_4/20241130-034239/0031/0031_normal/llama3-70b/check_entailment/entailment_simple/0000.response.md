Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It calculates the probability as an irreducible fraction and returns the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3.

The program uses a loop to calculate the numerator and denominator of the probability fraction, then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator to simplify the fraction. Finally, it returns the remainder of the simplified numerator and denominator when divided by 10^6 + 3.

The program follows the problem description accurately and should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
