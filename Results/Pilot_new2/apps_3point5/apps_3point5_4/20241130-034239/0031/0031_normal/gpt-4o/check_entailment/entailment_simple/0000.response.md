Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1` which calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is used to simplify the fraction A/B to its irreducible form.
2. `func_2` which calculates the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday among the k people interviewed by ZS the Coder. The program calculates the numerator and denominator of the probability fraction, reduces it to its irreducible form using `func_1`, and then prints the result modulo 10^6 + 3.

The program follows the problem description accurately. It correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday in Udayland with 2^n days in a year and k people interviewed. It returns the irreducible fraction A/B as required by the problem description and prints it modulo 10^6 + 3. The functions are implemented correctly based on the problem conditions and constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
