Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` should be in the range 1 to 10^18 and `k` should be in the range 2 to 10^18. The function then calculates the value of `k` after left shifting it by `n` bits and prints the result. Additionally, it performs a series of calculations involving modulo operations and another function `func_1` to compute and print specific values.**
