According to the code, the loop can execute if k is at least 1. Before the loop starts, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k ≤ 1 shifted left by n does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to k is greater than or equal to 1. 
State: **`MOD` is assigned the value 1000003, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that k is greater than or equal to 1, `total_days` is equal to 2 to the power of n, `numerator` is assigned the value 1, `denominator` is assigned the value 1**
