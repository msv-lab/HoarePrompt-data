The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. The precondition for `n` is that it should be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and for `k`, it should be an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns the current value of `k` after shifting it left by `n` bits. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` within the specified constraints and return the value of `k` after left shifting it by `n` bits.
