Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly reads the input, extracts all unique digits present in the cubes, and calculates the maximum possible number, it does not account for the specific rules regarding the digits 6 and 9.

According to the problem description, Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. However, there is no implementation in the provided program to handle this rule. Therefore, in cases where the input cubes contain both the digits 6 and 9, the program may output a number that is not valid according to the problem description.

To make the program correct, you would need to add logic to handle the constraints regarding the digits 6 and 9 when calculating the maximum possible number.
