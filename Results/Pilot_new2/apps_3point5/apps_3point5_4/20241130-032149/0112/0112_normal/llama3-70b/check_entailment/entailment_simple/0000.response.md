Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input of the number of cubes and the numbers on each cube's faces. It then creates a set of all the digits present on the cubes, excluding '0' if it exists. Finally, it finds the maximum number that can be formed using the unique digits and prints it.

The program ensures that the number '0' is not considered in forming the maximum number, as specified in the problem description. It correctly handles the input and calculates the maximum number that can be formed.
