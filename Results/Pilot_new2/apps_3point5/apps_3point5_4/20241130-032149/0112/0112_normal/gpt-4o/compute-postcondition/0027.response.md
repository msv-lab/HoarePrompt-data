Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values. `found` is False, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If the condition (not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]) is satisfied, then the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`***
