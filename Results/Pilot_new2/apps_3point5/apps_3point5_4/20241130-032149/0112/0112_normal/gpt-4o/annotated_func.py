#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3. cubes is a list of n lists, where each inner list has 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes (0 <= a_{i}_{j} <= 9).**
def func_1(n, cubes):
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]
    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of n lists, cube_faces is a list of sets, x is adjusted to satisfy can_form_number(x + n) condition, x is increased by n
    return x
    #The program returns the value of x after being increased by n, such that x satisfies the condition can_form_number(x + n).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts an integer n and a list of n lists, where each inner list represents the digits on the faces of the cubes. It iterates over the cubes to create a list of sets representing the unique digits on each cube face. Then, it incrementally increases the value of x until it satisfies the condition can_form_number(x + n), and finally returns the value of x.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube. Each integer is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).**
def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))
    used_cubes = [False] * n
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where each value is True, `found` is True
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of n tuples. Each tuple contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube, with each integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The function iterates through the digits in `num` and checks if each digit can be formed using the cube faces. If a digit cannot be formed, the function returns False. If all digits can be formed, it returns True.
