According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values with the ith element set to True if (not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]), `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased to 2 and `n` must still be greater than 2.
State: **num is a list of n tuples, digits is a list of strings with at least 1 element, used_cubes is a list of n boolean values with the ith element set to True if (not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]), found is True, i is 2, n must be greater than 2**
