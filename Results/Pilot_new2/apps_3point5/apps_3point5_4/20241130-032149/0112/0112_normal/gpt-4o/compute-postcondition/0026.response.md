According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of `n`. Since the condition `not found` is true at the start, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `found` is False, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0**
