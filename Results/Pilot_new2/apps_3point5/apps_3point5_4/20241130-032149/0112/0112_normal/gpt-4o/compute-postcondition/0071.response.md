Functionality: **The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of n tuples. Each tuple contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube, with each integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The function iterates through the digits in `num` and checks if each digit can be formed using the cube faces. If a digit cannot be formed, the function returns False. If all digits can be formed, it returns True.**
