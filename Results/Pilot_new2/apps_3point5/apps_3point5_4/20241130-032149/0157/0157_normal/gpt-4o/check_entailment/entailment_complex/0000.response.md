Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three input integers a, b, and c. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. It then computes the total number of fruits by considering the quantity of lemons, apples (2 lemons per apple), and pears (4 lemons per pear). Finally, it prints the total number of fruits obtained.

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote.
