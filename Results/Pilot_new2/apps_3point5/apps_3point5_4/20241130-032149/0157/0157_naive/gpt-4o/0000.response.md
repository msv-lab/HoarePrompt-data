Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It ensures that the fruits are in the ratio 1:2:4 and considers the case where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote. The logic of finding the minimum of lemons, half the apples, and one-fourth of the pears ensures that the ratio is maintained and the total count of fruits is calculated accurately. All the given examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the program.
