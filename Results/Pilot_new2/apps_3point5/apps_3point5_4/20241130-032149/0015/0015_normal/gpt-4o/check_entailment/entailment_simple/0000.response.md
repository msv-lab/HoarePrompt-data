Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It checks if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence `s` that starts from `a` with a difference of `c` between elements. It prints "YES" if `b` appears in the sequence and "NO" otherwise. The program covers all cases mentioned in the problem description and correctly determines whether `b` appears in the sequence. The conditions in the if-else blocks accurately reflect the rules defined in the problem description.
