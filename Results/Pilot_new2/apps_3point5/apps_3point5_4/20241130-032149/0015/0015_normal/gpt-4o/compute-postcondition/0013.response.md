Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string into integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a`, then if `c` is 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed.***
