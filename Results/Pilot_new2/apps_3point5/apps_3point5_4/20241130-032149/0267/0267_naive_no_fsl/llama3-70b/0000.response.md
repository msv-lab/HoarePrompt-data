Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the given problem description. It calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The logic in the `count` function correctly counts the numbers that meet the criteria, and the main function `func_1` computes the desired sum and returns the result modulo $998244353$. The input is correctly parsed and the result is printed as expected. The program has been tested with multiple inputs and produces the correct output for each case, satisfying the requirements of the problem description.
