According to the code, the loop will execute if the range from `l` to `r + 1` is valid and contains at least one number. Therefore, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, and at least one number must be in the range for the loop to execute. At the start of the loop, total_sum is 0, so the loop starts with the total_sum being 0.
State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, total_sum is 0**
