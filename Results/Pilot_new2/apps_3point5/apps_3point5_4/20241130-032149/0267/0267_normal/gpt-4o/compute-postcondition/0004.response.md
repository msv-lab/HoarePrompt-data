Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, total_sum is 0. If func_1(num, k) is true, then total_sum is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD, where MOD is a constant. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
