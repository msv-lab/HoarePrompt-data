Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads a string `s` from the user and iterates over the characters to check if they form the sequence 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If they do, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Otherwise, it prints -1. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description to check if the given string can be transformed into a subsequence of the English alphabet.

The program will always output the correct result based on the problem description because it iterates over the characters and checks for a specific sequence. If the characters in the input string `s` can form the English alphabet sequence in order, it will print 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Otherwise, it will print -1.
