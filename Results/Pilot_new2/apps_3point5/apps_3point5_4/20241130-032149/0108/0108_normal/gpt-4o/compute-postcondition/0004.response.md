According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `len(s)`, and `target_len`. If both `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5) and `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. To execute the loop one more time, `i` and `j` need to be adjusted such that they are less than the lengths of `s` and `target` respectively.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is less than `len(s)`, `j` is less than `target_len`**
