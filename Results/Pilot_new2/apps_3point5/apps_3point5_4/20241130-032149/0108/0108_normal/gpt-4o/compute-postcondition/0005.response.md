Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is less than `len(s)`, `j` is less than `target_len`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`, then the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`.***
