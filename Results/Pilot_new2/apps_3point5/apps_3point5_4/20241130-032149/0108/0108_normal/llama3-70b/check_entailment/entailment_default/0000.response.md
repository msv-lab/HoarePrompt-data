Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and constructs a string `res` by iterating through the alphabet and replacing characters in `s`.
- It ensures that the string `res` contains all lowercase English letters in consecutive order by replacing occurrences in `s`.
- If the length of `res` becomes 26 (equal to the length of the English alphabet), it prints `res`.
- If the length of `res` does not become 26, it prints -1.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly constructs the subsequence to contain all English alphabet characters in consecutive order.
