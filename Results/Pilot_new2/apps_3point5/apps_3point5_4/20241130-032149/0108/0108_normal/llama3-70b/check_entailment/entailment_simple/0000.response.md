Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads the input string `s` and then iterates through the alphabet character by character. For each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character is present in the input string `s`. If it is, it adds that character to the result string `res` and replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. This process continues until all characters in the alphabet have been checked. 

After the loop, it checks if the length of `res` is 26 (equal to the length of the English alphabet). If it is, then it means that the string contains all the English alphabet characters in consecutive order and it prints `res`. If the length of `res` is not 26, it prints -1.

This program correctly follows the problem description by checking if it is possible to obtain a string that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence and either printing that string or -1 if it's impossible.
