According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being the next character in `alphabet` that is not present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with all occurrences of the next character in `alphabet` replaced by consecutive characters in the alphabet, `res` includes all unique characters replaced in consecutive iterations, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that is not present in `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next character in `alphabet` that is not present in `s` should progress to the next character in the alphabet.
State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of the next character in `alphabet` replaced by consecutive characters in the alphabet, `res` includes all unique characters replaced in consecutive iterations, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that is not present in `s` progresses to the next character in the alphabet**
