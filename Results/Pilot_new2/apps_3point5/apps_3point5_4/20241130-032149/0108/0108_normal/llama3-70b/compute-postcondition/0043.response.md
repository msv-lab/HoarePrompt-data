Functionality: ** The function reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, iterates through the alphabet, and constructs a string `res` that contains all lowercase English letters in consecutive order by replacing occurrences in `s`. If the length of `res` becomes 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
