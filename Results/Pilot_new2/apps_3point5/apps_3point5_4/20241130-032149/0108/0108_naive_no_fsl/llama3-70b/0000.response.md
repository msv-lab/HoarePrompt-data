Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input string `s`.
2. It then iterates through the English alphabet characters.
3. For each character, it checks if that character is present in the input string `s`.
4. If the character is found, it appends it to the result string `res` and replaces that character with the next character in the alphabet in the input string `s`.
5. After iterating through all the alphabet characters, it checks if the length of the result string `res` is 26, which corresponds to the entire English alphabet.
6. If the length is 26, it prints the result string `res`, which should contain the English alphabet as a subsequence. If not, it prints -1.
7. The program correctly handles the case when it is impossible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence and prints -1 in such cases.
