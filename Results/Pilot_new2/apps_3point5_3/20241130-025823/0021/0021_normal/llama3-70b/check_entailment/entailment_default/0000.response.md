Correctness: **True**

The code reads an integer input n, followed by a list of integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list, the minimum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list, and prints the maximum of the two distances along with n - 1. The code seems to be following the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly determines the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after performing exactly one swap. The logic of finding the positions of 1 and n and calculating the distances between them is sound and covers all scenarios as specified in the problem description.
