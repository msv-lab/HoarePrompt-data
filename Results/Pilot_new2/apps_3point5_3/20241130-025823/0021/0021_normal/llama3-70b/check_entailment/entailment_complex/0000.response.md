Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input as specified, calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements, and then prints the result. The logic used in the program to calculate the maximum distance by considering the positions of 1 and n in the array and comparing it with n - 2 is correct and follows the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and will always give the expected output based on the problem description for all potential cases.
