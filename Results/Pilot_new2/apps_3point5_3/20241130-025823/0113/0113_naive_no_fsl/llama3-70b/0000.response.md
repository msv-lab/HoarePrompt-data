Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of n and k.
2. It calculates x as 10 to the power of k, which represents the number with k zeros at the end.
3. It then iterates over values starting from n and increments n until n is divisible by x, which is the k-rounding of n.
4. The program outputs the k-rounding of n, which meets the requirements of the problem description.
5. For all possible inputs within the given constraints, the program logic seems to be correct and produces the expected output.
