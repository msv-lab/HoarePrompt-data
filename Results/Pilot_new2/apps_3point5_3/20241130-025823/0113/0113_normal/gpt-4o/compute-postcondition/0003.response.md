The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of `x`, which is the result of n multiplied by 10 raised to the power of k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10 raised to the power of k. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the value of x calculated as described. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and k, and returns the value of x calculated as (n * 10^k) / gcd(n, 10^k).**
