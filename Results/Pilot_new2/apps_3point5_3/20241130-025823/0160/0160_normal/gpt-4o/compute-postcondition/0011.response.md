Output State: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, divisors is a set containing the value of i that was added by the code execution and divisors now contains x // i for all i where x is divisible by i and i is increased by 1 and i is less than or equal to the square root of x, i is increased by 1, i has been added to divisors.
