The function func_1 accepts a list of integers lst and calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list. The function assumes the list has at least two elements and the elements are valid integers. However, the function does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains only one element. It also does not include any error handling for cases where the input list is not in the specified format. If the list is not valid, the function may encounter errors or provide unexpected results.
