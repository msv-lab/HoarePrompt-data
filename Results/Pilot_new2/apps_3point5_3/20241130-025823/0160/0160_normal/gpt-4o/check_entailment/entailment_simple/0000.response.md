Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not correctly solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the specific requirements of finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list `A` after performing the specified operations.

In order for the program to be correct, it needs to implement the specific steps outlined in the problem description. The functions provided do not perform the required operations of choosing two integers and modifying them to find the maximum possible positive integer.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
