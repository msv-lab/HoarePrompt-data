Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code consists of two functions, where `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of a list of integers and `func_2` calculates the divisors of a given integer `x`.
- The main program takes input for `N`, `K`, and the list `A`, calculates the sum of `A`, the greatest common divisor of `A`, and then finds the divisors of the sum.
- It then iterates through the divisors, checking if the divisor satisfies the condition for dividing every element of `A` after the operations.
- If the condition is satisfied, the program prints the divisor and breaks the loop.
- The code structure seems to align with the problem description and the logic behind finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of `A` after the operations.
- There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program might not work as expected based on the provided problem description.
- The output hints also agree with the code functions and their purpose, further confirming that the code is correctly implementing the specified task.
