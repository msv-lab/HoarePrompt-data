The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99. After executing the function body, the program checks for the following cases:
Case_1: If n is between 0 and 9, the program returns the string representation of the number 'n' from the list 'ones'.
Case_2: If n is between 11 and 19, the program returns the string representation of the number in the 'teens' list at index n - 10.
Case_3: If n is in the tens place (i.e., 10, 20, 30, ...), the program returns the string representing the tens place of the current value of n.
Case_4: If n is a two-digit number other than the cases mentioned above, the program returns the string representation of the given integer 'n' in words by concatenating the tens place value from the list 'tens' with the ones place value from the list 'ones' separated by a hyphen.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` between 0 and 99 and return the string representation of that number based on the specified cases.
