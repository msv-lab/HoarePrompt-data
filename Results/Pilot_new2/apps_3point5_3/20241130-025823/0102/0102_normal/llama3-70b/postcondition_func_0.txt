The function defines lists of strings representing numbers from 0 to 9, 10 to 19, and tens values. It then takes an integer input and prints the corresponding string representation based on the input value. If the input is less than 10, it prints the string from the `ones` list. If the input is between 10 and 19, it prints the string from the `teens` list. For inputs greater than or equal to 20, it prints the combination of the tens and ones strings. The function does not return any value but determines the string representation of the input number.
