Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It defines lists of strings representing numbers from 0 to 9, 10 to 19, and tens values. Then, based on the input integer, it prints the corresponding string representation of the number. If the input is less than 10, it prints the string from the `ones` list. If the input is between 10 and 19, it prints the string from the `teens` list. For inputs greater than or equal to 20, it prints the combination of the tens and ones strings. The code covers all possible cases as mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each scenario.
