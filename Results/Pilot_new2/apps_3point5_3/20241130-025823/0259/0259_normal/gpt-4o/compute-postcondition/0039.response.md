The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of that route. After executing the function body, the program returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time + 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of bus routes, and return the index of the route with the minimum wait time + 1.
