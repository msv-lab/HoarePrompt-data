According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states were present:

State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, min_wait_time is equal to the current value of wait_time, chosen_route is i + 1 where i is 1, s_i is the first element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes, d_i is the second element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes, s_i is equal to the first element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes, d_i is equal to the second element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes**

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1 and update the values of `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and calculate the new `wait_time` based on the given conditions. No other variables need to be modified unless `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.

State for the next iteration: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, min_wait_time is equal to the current value of wait_time, chosen_route is i + 2, s_i is the first element of the tuple at index i+1 in bus_routes, d_i is the second element of the tuple at index i+1 in bus_routes. Update wait_time based on the conditions provided.**
