Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `_` is incremented by `n`, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is equal to the current value of time if time < min_time, otherwise min_time retains its previous value, `ans` is equal to the current value of i plus 1 if time < min_time, otherwise ans retains its previous value, `i` is 0, `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`***
