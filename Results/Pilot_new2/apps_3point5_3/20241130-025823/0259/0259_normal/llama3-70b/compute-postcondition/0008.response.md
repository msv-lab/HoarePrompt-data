According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` should be less than `n+1`. Additionally, a new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list, so there should be an additional tuple in the `buses` list.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains at least one more tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is incremented by 2, `s` is assigned the first integer obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `d` is assigned the second integer obtained from splitting the input by spaces, and a new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list**
