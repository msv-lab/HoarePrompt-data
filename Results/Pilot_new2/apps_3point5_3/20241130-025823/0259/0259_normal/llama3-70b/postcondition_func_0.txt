Functionality: The function `func` reads input consisting of positive integers `n` and `t`, followed by `n` tuples each representing bus routes with start times and intervals. It then calculates the minimum time difference for each bus route based on the current time `t` and prints the index of the bus route with the smallest time difference. The function does not return any value. Edge cases and missing functionalities: The function does not handle invalid inputs, negative integers, or edge cases where multiple bus routes have the same minimum time difference.
