Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through all the bus routes, calculates the wait time for each route based on the given time $t$, and selects the route with the minimum wait time. The logic for calculating the wait time and choosing the correct route is implemented correctly in the code. Additionally, it handles the cases where the first bus of a route arrives after time $t$ and where there are multiple buses arriving at the same time. The code also correctly reads the input and formats the output as required by the problem description. All the provided examples and potential cases are handled correctly by the code.
