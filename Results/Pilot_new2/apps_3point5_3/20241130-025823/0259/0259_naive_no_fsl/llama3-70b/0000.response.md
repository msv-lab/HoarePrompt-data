Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values, calculates the arrival time of each bus for Serval based on the given time, and then determines which bus route Serval will take. It iterates through each bus route and finds the minimum arrival time for Serval, which is the correct approach as the description mentions that Serval will take the first bus he sees. The program then prints the bus route number that Serval will use. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
