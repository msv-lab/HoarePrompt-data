Correctness: True

Explanation: 
- The program takes input as described in the problem.
- The function `func_1` calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the given time `t` and the arrival time of the first bus on that route.
- It then chooses the bus route with the minimum wait time and returns the route number.
- The implementation seems to be correctly following the problem description and logic provided. 
- The program handles the scenario where Serval will choose the first bus he sees based on the wait time calculated for each bus route.
