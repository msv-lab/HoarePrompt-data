Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values and implements a sliding window approach to find if there exists an interval with the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. It iterates through the colors and maintains a window of Jedi Knights, checking if the current window satisfies the desired counts. The program returns "YES" if such an interval is found, otherwise it returns "NO". The implementation seems to cover all potential cases and works correctly as described in the problem statement.
