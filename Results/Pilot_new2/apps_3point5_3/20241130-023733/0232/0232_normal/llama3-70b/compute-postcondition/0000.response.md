Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n. The input colors of lightsabers are represented by n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. The desired counts of lightsabers of each color are represented by m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} such that 1 <= sum of k_i <= n.**
