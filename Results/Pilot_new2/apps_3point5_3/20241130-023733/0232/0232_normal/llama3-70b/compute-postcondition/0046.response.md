Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `colors`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `j` are integers increased by 1. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 1. If all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
