According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the colors list. If there are more colors in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 1 color, color is the first color in the list, counts is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, and color_counts is a dictionary with the key color and value 1 if color is not already in color_counts. 

To execute the loop one more time, the colors list must have more colors, therefore the color list should have at least one more color, and color should be updated to the next color in the list. 
State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 colors, color is the second color in the list, counts is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, color_counts is a dictionary with the key color and value 1 if color is not already in color_counts.**
