According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
