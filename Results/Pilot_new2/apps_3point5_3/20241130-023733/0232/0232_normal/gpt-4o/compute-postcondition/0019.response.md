Output State: **n, m are positive integers with 1 <= m <= n. colors is a list of n integers. desired_counts is a dictionary with keys from 1 to m. current_counts is a defaultdict(int) with keys from 1 to m. At least one current_counts[color] is less than desired_counts[color and current_counts[colors[left]] needs to be decreased by 1. If all current_counts[color] are equal to desired_counts[color], the function returns 'YES'.**
