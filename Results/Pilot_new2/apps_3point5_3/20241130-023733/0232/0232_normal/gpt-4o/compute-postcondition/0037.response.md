Postcondition: ***`left` and `right` are both incremented by 3. `current_counts` for colors at `right` and `left` are both decremented by 1. The counts of colors at `right` and `left` in `current_counts` are still greater than or equal to the counts in `desired_counts`. If all the color counts in `current_counts` match the counts in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES'.***
