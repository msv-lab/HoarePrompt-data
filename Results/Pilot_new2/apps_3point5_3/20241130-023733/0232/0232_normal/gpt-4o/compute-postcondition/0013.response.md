Postcondition: ***n, m are positive integers with 1 <= m <= n. colors is a list of n integers, desired_counts is a dictionary with keys from 1 to m, current_counts is a defaultdict(int) with keys from 1 to m. At least one current_counts[color] is less than desired_counts[color. If all current_counts[color] are equal to desired_counts[color], then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
