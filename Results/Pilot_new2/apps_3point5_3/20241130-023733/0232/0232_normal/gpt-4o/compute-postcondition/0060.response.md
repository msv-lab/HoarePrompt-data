Output State: The function will return 'YES' only if all colors in `colors` have the same count as in `desired_counts`. `left` variable will have its final value such that `left` has been incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. The `current_counts` dictionary must have the same count for each color as in `desired_counts`. If there exists at least one color where the count in `current_counts` is not the same as in `desired_counts`, then the function will not return 'YES'. The final values of `left`, `right`, and `current_counts` will reflect the state after all iterations of the loop have finished.
