Output State: **The program returns 'YES' after incrementing both `left` and `right` by 3 and decrementing the counts of colors at `right` and `left` in `current_counts` by 1, ensuring that the counts of colors at `right` and `left` are still greater than or equal to the counts in `desired_counts`.**
