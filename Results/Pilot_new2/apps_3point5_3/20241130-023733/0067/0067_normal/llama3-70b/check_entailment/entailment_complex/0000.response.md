Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input integers x, y, and z, and based on their values, determines the relationship between them, as described in the problem statement. It handles all possible cases and prints the correct output ('+', '-', '0', or '?') based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

The program ensures that there is only one possible result when the conditions are met, and it correctly identifies uncertain situations when there are multiple possible results. The annotations provided also describe the state of the variables before and after each block of code, showing that the program is handling the inputs and conditions as expected.
