Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the integers obtained from the input split. `min_upvotes` is equal to the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. Additionally, `max_upvotes` is not less than `min_downvotes`. If max_downvotes < min_upvotes, then the program does nothing and the state of the variables remains the same. If max_downvotes is not less than min_upvotes, the program also does nothing, and the state of the variables remains the same. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.**
