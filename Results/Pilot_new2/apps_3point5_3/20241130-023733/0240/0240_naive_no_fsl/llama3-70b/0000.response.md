Correctness: True

The program correctly takes the input string `s` and the remembered substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to only keep the characters that are also in `t`. It then appends the remembered substring `t` to the end of the filtered `s` to form the smallest integer. The logic seems correct and the program should work for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
