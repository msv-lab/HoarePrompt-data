Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The `func_1` function first calculates the number of characters needed to form the integer `n` based on the length of the input string `s` and the substring `sub`. It then decrements the characters in `s` based on the characters in `sub`, ensuring that the substring `sub` is removed from the available characters.

2. The function then generates all possible permutations of the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters in `sub`. It checks each permutation to see if it forms a valid number by calling the `is_valid_number` function, which checks if the substring `sub` is present in the candidate number and if the length of the candidate number is correct.

3. If a valid number is found, it is yielded. Finally, the function returns the smallest number among the valid numbers generated.

4. The `is_valid_number` function correctly checks if the substring `sub` is present in the candidate number and if the length of the candidate number is equal to the calculated length `n_len`.

The program covers all possible cases and ensures that the smallest possible initial integer `n` is generated based on the provided input. It follows the problem description and returns the correct output for all valid inputs.
