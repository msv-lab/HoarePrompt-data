#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of digits and sub is a substring of s.**
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: s_counter[char] has been decremented by the total value of sub_counter[char] for all keys in sub_counter.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the smallest number generated from the characters in remaining_chars after the decrement operation from s_counter and sub_counter, as well as the generation of possible numbers using sub
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 takes two parameters, `s` and `sub`, where `s` is a string of digits and `sub` is a substring of `s`. It then decrements the character counts in `s_counter` based on `sub_counter`. It generates possible numbers from the remaining characters in `remaining_chars`, using `sub`, and returns the smallest number among them.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a string representing a very large integer, and sub is a substring of num_str.**
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if substring 'sub' is present in the 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len', otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `is_valid_number` takes in two parameters, `num_str` (a string representing a very large integer) and `sub` (a substring of `num_str`). It returns True if the substring `sub` is present in `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`. Otherwise, it returns False. However, there is a missing implementation in the code, as the variable `n_len` is not defined or used within the function. This leads to potential inaccuracies in the function's behavior, and the functionality may not fully align with the annotations provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: At the end of the loop execution, all permutations of `chars` have been iterated through. The `candidate` variable contains all valid numbers that satisfy the condition specified in the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub` and have been yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generate_possible_numbers accepts two parameters, chars (a string of characters) and sub (a subset of chars), and generates all possible numbers by permuting the characters in sub. It then checks if each candidate number is valid by calling the is_valid_number function with respect to sub. The function yields all valid candidate numbers.
