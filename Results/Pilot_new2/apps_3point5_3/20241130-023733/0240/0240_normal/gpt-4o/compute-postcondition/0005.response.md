According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations generated from `chars` and the validity of `candidate` with respect to `sub`. If the condition for a valid number with respect to `sub` is satisfied by `candidate`, then it is yielded. 

At the end of the last iteration, `chars` has at least 1 permutation and `candidate` is a string formed by joining the permutations in `chars`. So for the loop to execute one more time, a new permutation needs to be generated from `chars` and a new `candidate` needs to be formed.

State: **`chars` has at least 1 more permutation, a new `candidate` is formed from the new permutation**
