According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more permutations available in the `chars` and a new `candidate` is formed from the new permutation. If the `candidate` is valid based on the criteria specified in the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, then the if block is executed.

At the end of the last iteration, `chars` has at least 1 more permutation, and a new `candidate` is formed. If the `candidate` is valid based on the criteria specified in the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, then the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`chars` has at least 1 more permutation, a new `candidate` is formed, `candidate` is valid based on the criteria specified in the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`**
