Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the problem description. It takes a non-negative integer n as input, calculates the remainder of n divided by 10, and then rounds n to the nearest integer ending with 0 by either subtracting the remainder if it is less than or equal to 5, or adding (10 - remainder) if it is greater than 5. The program then prints the rounded result.

The program handles all cases mentioned in the problem description and outputs the correct rounded result for each case. It provides a valid solution to the problem as described.
