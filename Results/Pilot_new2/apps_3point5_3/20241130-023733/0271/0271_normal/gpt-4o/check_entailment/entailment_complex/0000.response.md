Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a non-negative integer input `n`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and then rounds `n` to the nearest integer ending with 0, as specified in the problem description. The program handles all cases where the remainder is less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5, and adjusts `n` accordingly to achieve the desired rounding behavior. Overall, the program behaves as expected and provides the correct output for the given problem description.
