Postcondition: ***s is a string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, consisting of only English letters; n is the length of s and n is at least 2. If s[i] != s[n - 1 - i] is true, the program returns False. If s[i] != s[n - 1 - i] is false for all i, then the characters at positions i and n - 1 - i in the string s are equal for all valid i values.***
