You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let's call a string "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example, the string "oHo" is "s-palindrome", but the string "aa" is not. The string "aa" is not "s-palindrome", because the second half of it is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

 [Image] English alphabet 

You are given a string s. Check if the string is "s-palindrome".


-----Input-----

The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000) which consists of only English letters.


-----Output-----

Print "TAK" if the string s is "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise.


-----Examples-----
Input
oXoxoXo

Output
TAK

Input
bod

Output
TAK

Input
ER

Output
NIE
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000.**
def func():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    is_spalindrome = True
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - i - 1]:
            is_spalindrome = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True if the string `s` is a palindrome, False otherwise. `i` is equal to `n // 2` at the end of the loop.
    print('TAK' if is_spalindrome else 'NIE')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input string `s` consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It then iterates through the string to determine if it is a palindrome. If the string is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, it operates on the input string and prints the result based on whether the string is a palindrome or not.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
