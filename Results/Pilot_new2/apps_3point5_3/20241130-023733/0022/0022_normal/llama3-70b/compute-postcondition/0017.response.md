Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True if the string `s` is a palindrome, False otherwise, `i` is equal to `n // 2` at the end of the loop. The program prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, and 'NIE' if `is_spalindrome` is False.**
