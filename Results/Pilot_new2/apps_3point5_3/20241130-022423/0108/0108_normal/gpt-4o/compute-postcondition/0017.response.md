The loop iterates over the string `s` and the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' stored in `target`. It compares each character in `s` with the corresponding character in `target` and increments `j` only if the characters match. After each iteration, `i` is incremented. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is equal to len(s), `j` is equal to target_len**
