According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being present in `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows:
- `s` has all occurrences of the next character in `alphabet` replaced by the character that comes after the next character in the alphabet with the first occurrence of `char` replaced and the next character in `alphabet` after the last replacement is present in `s` along with `char`.
- The replaced `char` is different from the last replacement.
- `res` contains the concatenated value of all occurrences of the next character in `alphabet` along with `char`.
- `char` is replaced with `chr(ord(char) + 1)` in `s` only for the first occurrence.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Ensure that `char` is present in `s`.
2. Replace the first occurrence of `char` with `chr(ord(char) + 1)` in `s`.
3. Update `res` to contain the concatenated value of all occurrences of the next character in `alphabet` along with the new value of `char`.

State: **`s` has all occurrences of the next character in `alphabet` replaced by the character that comes after the next character in the alphabet with the first occurrence of `chr(ord(char) + 1)` replaced, `res` contains the concatenated value of all occurrences of the next character in `alphabet` along with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`, and `char` must be present in `s`**
