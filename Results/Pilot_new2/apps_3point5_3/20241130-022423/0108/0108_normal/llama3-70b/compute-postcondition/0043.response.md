Functionality: **The function reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters from the user input. It iterates over the alphabet, and for each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character exists in the input string `s`. If found, it appends that character to the result string `res` and replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. Finally, if the length of `res` is 26, it prints out `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value and operates solely on the input string `s`.**
