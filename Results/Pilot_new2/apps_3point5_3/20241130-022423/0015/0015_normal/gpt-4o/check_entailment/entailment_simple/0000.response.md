Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It first reads the input integers a, b, and c. It then checks if b is equal to a, in which case it prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it further checks if c is equal to 0, in which case it prints 'NO'. If c is not equal to 0, it checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. 

The program covers all cases as described in the problem statement and prints the correct output for each case.
