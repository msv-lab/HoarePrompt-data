Output State: **a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. b is not equal to a. c is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the values of a, b, and c satisfy the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0.**
