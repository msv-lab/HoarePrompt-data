Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If b is equal to a, then the favorite integer will be in the sequence and the output will be "YES".
2. If c is 0, then the sequence will not include the favorite integer and the output will be "NO".
3. In all other cases, if the favorite integer can be reached by starting from a and incrementing by c, then the output will be "YES"; otherwise, the output will be "NO". This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
