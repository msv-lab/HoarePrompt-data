Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It first checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and if it is greater than or equal to 0. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES", indicating that `b` appears in the sequence. Otherwise, it prints "NO". 
The program handles both cases where `c` is 0, as well as when `c` is a non-zero value. It covers all potential scenarios and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
