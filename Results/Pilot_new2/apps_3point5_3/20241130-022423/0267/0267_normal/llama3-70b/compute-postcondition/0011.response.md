Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated results, `k` is not equal to 0, (n, k) is not in `dp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k] = 9, `i` is an integer such that 1 <= `i` <= 9**. `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` to its previous value.
