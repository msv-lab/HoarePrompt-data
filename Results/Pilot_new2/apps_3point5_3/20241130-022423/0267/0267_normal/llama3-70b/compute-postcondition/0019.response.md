Postcondition: ***l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary to store previously calculated results where k is not equal to 0 and the pair (n, k) is not in dp. If n < 10^k, dp[(n, k)] = n. After the execution of the if else block, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, dp contains the calculated result for dp[n, k], (n, k) is in dp with the value calculated from the loop code, `i` is equal to k, and dp[n, k] is increased by 10 and then taken modulo MOD.***
