According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 1 inner list, the loop will execute. At the start, `n` is an input integer, so it doesn't affect the loop execution. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `cubes` must have at least 1 inner list, and `cube` should be the first inner list in the `cubes` list. Additionally, `digits` should remain an empty set.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list, `cube` is the first inner list in the `cubes` list, `digits` is an empty set**
