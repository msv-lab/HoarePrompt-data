According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list and the `digit` variable. If there are more digits in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, `found` is True, and the condition `found` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the list `digits` must have more digits, and the loop should move on to the next digit.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, `found` is True, and the condition `found` is False**
