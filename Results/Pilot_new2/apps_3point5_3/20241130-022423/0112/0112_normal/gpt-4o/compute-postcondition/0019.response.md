Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True with `used_cubes[i]` being False for the new `i`, `found` is True, `n` must be greater than the new `i + 1`, `used_cubes[i+1]` is True, and `found` is True. If `used_cubes[i]` is True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
