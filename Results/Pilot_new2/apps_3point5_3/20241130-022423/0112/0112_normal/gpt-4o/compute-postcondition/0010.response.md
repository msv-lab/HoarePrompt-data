According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states were present:
- `num` is an integer greater than 0
- `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit
- `digit` is the first digit in the list
- All elements in `used_cubes` are False
- `found` is True
- `n` must be greater than 0
- After entering the if condition, `used_cubes[i]` is True 
- `digit` is in `cube_faces[i] 
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement

For the loop to execute one more time, the `i` value needs to be incremented by 1. 
So, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True with `used_cubes[i]` being False for the new `i`, `found` is True, `n` must be greater than the new `i`.**
