Correctness: **True**

The code takes in three positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has. It then calculates the minimum possible number of complete sets of fruits that can be used to cook the compote based on the ratio given in the problem description. By choosing the minimum value among the number of lemons, apples divided by 2, and pears divided by 4, the code ensures that Nikolay can cook the maximum number of compotes possible. The final result is the sum of this minimum value added with itself multiplied by 2 and 4, which correctly represents the total number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use to make the compote. 

The output hints also agree with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct in following the problem description for every potential case.
