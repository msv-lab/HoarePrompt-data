Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has as input. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the ratio provided in the description. It uses the minimum of lemons, apples divided by 2, and pears divided by 4 to determine the maximum number of lemons. The total number of fruits is then calculated by multiplying the maximum lemons by 1, 2, and 4 respectively. The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case as it calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use to cook the compote. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the description that the code fails to address.
