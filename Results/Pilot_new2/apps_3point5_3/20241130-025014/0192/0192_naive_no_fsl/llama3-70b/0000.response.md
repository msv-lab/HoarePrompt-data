Correctness: False

The given program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The minimum number of seconds required to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from an equilateral triangle of side length x is not just the absolute difference between x and y.

For example, if x = 6 and y = 3, the correct sequence of operations should be (6,6,6) -> (6,6,3) -> (6,4,3) -> (3,4,3) -> (3,3,3), which takes 4 seconds. However, the given program would output abs(6 - 3) = 3 seconds, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness False.
