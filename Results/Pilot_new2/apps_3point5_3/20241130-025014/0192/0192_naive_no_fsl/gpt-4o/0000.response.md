Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The logic implemented in the program follows the problem description as it calculates the difference between x and y, divides it by 2, and adds the remainder if the difference is odd, which represents the minimum number of seconds. The program handles all potential cases and produces the correct output based on the given inputs.
