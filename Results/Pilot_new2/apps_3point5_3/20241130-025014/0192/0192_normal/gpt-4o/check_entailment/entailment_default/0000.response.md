Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting from a triangle of side length `x`. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` correctly computes this minimum number of seconds by taking the difference between the side lengths and dividing by 2, then adding the remainder if the difference is odd. 

The code adheres to the problem description by correctly implementing the logic required to determine the minimum number of seconds and accounts for different scenarios where the side lengths are integers. Additionally, all provided examples are handled correctly by the code, making it a valid solution for the problem.
