Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the logic required by the problem description. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers `x` and `y`, and prints the result. It does not perform the operations necessary to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y` as described in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not solve the given problem.
