Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the side lengths of the starting and ending equilateral triangles respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from x, by performing the given operations.

The program calculates the difference between x and y, then divides it by 2 to get the number of sides that need to be modified. The program also adds 1 if the difference is odd, as Memory can only make integer adjustments to the side lengths.

The logic in the program aligns with the problem description, and for all potential cases where the starting and ending side lengths are within the specified constraints, the program provides the correct output. Thus, the correctness of the program is true.
