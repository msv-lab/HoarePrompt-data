Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price, then checks if the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price. If it is, it prints the initial amount of bourles. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial bourles, then calculates the total bourles after selling those shares at the maximum sell price. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
