The function reads input for integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, as well as lists of integers `s` and `b`. It calculates `min_buy_price` as the minimum value in list `s` and `max_sell_price` as the maximum value in list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it computes `max_shares`, `remaining_bourles`, and `total_bourles` based on the given conditions and prints `total_bourles`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.
