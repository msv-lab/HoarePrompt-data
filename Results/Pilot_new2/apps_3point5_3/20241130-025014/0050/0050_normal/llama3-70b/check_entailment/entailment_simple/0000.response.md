Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input values and sorts the prices of buying and selling shares. Then, it iterates through each opportunity to buy shares and calculates how many shares can be bought with the available money. After that, it iterates through the opportunities to sell shares and calculates the total money after selling all shares bought.

The program ensures that shares are sold only if they have been bought previously and handles the cases where no shares are bought or sold. Therefore, it always calculates the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening as per the problem description.
