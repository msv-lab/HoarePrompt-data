Postcondition: ***`n+1`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], shares is increased by r divided by s[i], and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. Otherwise, if r is less than s[i], we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
