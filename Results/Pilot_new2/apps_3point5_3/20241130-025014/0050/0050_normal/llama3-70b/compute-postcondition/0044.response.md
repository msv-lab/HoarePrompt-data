Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with lists of integers `s` and `b`. It sorts the lists `s` and `b`, then iterates through `s` to calculate the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`. It then iterates through `b` to update `r` based on the number of shares bought. The final value of `r` is printed. The function does not have explicit return values and operates on the predefined constraints.**
