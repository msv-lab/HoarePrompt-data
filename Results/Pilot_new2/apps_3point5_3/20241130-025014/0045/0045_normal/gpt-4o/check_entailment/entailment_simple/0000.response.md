Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It first checks if there exists a sequence that meets the requirements, by calculating the minimum sum possible based on the number of elements in the sequence. If the minimum sum is greater than n, it returns -1 as expected. Otherwise, it calculates the common divisor 'd' and distributes the remainder among the elements of the sequence to maximize the greatest common divisor. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence.

The program covers all possible cases and returns the correct output as specified in the problem description. Hence, it is correct.
