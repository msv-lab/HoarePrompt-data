Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in two integer inputs n and k, then calls the `func_1` function to generate a sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.
- The `func_1` function calculates the minimum sum required for a sequence of length k using the formula k*(k+1)/2 and compares it with n. If the minimum sum exceeds n, the function returns -1.
- If the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, the function calculates a sequence where each element is a multiple of d, which is n divided by the minimum sum. It then adjusts the sequence based on the remainder left after forming the initial sequence to ensure the sum is n.
- The function then returns the generated sequence, which satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
- The code handles the case where there is no possible sequence by returning -1.
- Based on the code logic and the problem description, it can be observed that the code follows the problem requirements for all potential cases. The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming its correctness.
