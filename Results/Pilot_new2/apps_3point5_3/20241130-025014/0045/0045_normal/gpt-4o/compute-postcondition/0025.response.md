The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If the function is executed, it returns -1.

Case_2: If the function is successful, it returns a list 'sequence' after performing the described operations. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integer parameters n and k, and either return -1 or a list 'sequence' based on the execution of the function.
