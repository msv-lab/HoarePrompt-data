Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is equal to k*(k+1)/2 and less than or equal to n; d is calculated as the floor division of n by min_sum; remainder is equal to n - d * min_sum; sequence is a list containing elements d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, i is initialized to k - 1. The current value of remainder is 0. The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. After running the code, the value of sequence[i] is increased by 1.**
