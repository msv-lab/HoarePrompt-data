Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers `n` and `k` as input, representing the number of days in a year and the number of people to be interviewed, respectively.
- The function `func_1` calculates the total number of days in Udayland, then iterates through a loop to update the numerator and denominator values based on the loop index and total days.
- After the loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator, divides both by the gcd, and returns the remainders of numerator and denominator divided by (10^6 + 3).
- The code follows the problem description by accurately calculating the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days for k people.
- The output hints agree with the code, clarifying the functionality of the `func_1` function and its correct approach to calculating A and B values.
