According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is at least 1. Since k is given to be at least 2, the loop will definitely execute. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, total_days = 2^n, numerator = 1, denominator = 1, i is 0**
