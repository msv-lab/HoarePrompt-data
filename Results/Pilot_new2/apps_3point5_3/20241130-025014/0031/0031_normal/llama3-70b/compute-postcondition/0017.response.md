The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns the remainder of numerator divided by (10^6 + 3) and the remainder of denominator divided by (10^6 + 3), where total_days = 2^n, numerator = ((2^n - (k-1)) * (2^n - (k-2)) * ... * 2), denominator = 2^(k*n), gcd is the greatest common divisor of numerator and denominator, and then numerator is divided by gcd and denominator is divided by gcd. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, calculate the remainders of numerator and denominator divided by (10^6 + 3), and perform the necessary operations on the numerator and denominator as described.
