According to the code, the loop can execute k times. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, k is the total number of iterations to be done. For the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be increased by 1 and k must be greater than the new value of i.
State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, k is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, MOD is 1000003, k is less than or equal to 1 << n, total_days is 2^n, numerator is updated to the result of numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD, denominator is equal to total_days * (total_days - 1) % MOD, i is 2**.
