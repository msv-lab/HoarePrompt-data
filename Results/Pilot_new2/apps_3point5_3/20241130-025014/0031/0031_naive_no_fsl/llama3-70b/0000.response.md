Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days correctly by iterating through the range of k and calculating the numerator and denominator.
2. It then finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator and divides both by the gcd to ensure the fraction is irreducible.
3. Finally, it takes the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 as required in the problem statement and returns the A and B values.
4. The input is correctly taken from the user and the output is printed in the required format. 
5. The program handles large numbers by taking the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3.
