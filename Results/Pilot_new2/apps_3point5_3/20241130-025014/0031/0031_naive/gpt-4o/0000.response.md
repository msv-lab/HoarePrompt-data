Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values of n and k and calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland. It then reduces the fraction A/B to its simplest form by finding the greatest common divisor using the `func_1` function. The program correctly calculates the probability and outputs the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3, as required. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, making it correct.
