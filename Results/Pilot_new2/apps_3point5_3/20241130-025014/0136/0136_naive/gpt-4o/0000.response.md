Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as strings and removes leading zeroes from each. Then it compares the lengths of a and b, if they are not equal, it prints "<" if a has fewer digits and ">" if b has fewer digits. If the lengths are equal, it compares the strings a and b, and prints "<" if a is less than b, ">" if a is greater than b, and "=" if they are equal. The program handles the case where both a and b have leading zeroes and correctly compares the numbers after removing them. The logic provided in the program matches the problem description for all potential cases.
