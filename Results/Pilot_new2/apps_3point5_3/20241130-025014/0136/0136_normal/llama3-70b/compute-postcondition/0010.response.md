Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is the input string after removing any leading zeros. If `a` equals `b`, then `a` is equal to `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program prints '>'.***
