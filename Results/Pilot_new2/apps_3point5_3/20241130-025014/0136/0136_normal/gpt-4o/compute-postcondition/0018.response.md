Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers with no leading zeroes. If `a` is '0', `b` is '0'. If `b` is not '0', `a` is False in a boolean context. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and the length of `a` is not greater than the length of `b`. The condition (a < b) is false, meaning a is greater than or equal to b. The current value of `a` is greater than `b`.***
