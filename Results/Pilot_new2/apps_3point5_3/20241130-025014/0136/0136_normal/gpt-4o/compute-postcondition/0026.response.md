The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes two non-negative integers, `a` and `b`, each with no more than 10^6 digits. The function then performs certain operations on these integers but does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process two non-negative integers, `a` and `b`, with no more than 10^6 digits each.
