Correctness: **True**

The program reads two non-negative integers a and b, each with potentially leading zeroes and no more than 10^6 digits. It then compares the values of a and b based on their lengths and numerical values. If the length of a is less than the length of b, it prints '<'. If the length of a is greater than the length of b, it prints '>'. If the lengths are equal, it compares the numerical values of a and b and prints '<', '>', or '=' accordingly. The program does exactly what the problem description asks for in all cases.
