Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty based on the initial configuration of `votes`. If `d_queue` is not empty, then it will contain the indices of 'D' characters that were processed, `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters that were processed, `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last popped values from the respective queues, and the function will process the elements in `d_queue`. If the else part is executed, `d_queue` will be empty, `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters that were processed, `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters that were processed, `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last popped values from the respective queues, and 'R' is processed.***
