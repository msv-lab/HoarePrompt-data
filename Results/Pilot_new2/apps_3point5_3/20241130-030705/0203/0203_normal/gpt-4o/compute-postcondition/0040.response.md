Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty depending on the initial configuration of `votes`. The `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters that were processed, and the `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters that were processed. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last popped values from the respective queues. Additionally, if the condition `(d_queue)` is true, then the `d_queue` is not empty and has elements to process.***
