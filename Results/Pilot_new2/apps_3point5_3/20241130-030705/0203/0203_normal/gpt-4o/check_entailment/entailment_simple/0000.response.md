Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the problem description. It processes the employees' votes according to the rules specified in the problem, where employees from both fractions take turns to deny others from voting until only one employee is left.

The program maintains two queues `d_queue` and `r_queue` to keep track of the indices of employees from the 'D' and 'R' fractions respectively. It then processes the votes based on the order of the indices in the queues. The logic inside the while loop ensures that employees are removed from voting based on their indices and the order of processing the fractions is maintained.

After all iterations, the program correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on which queue is empty. If the `d_queue` is not empty, it prints 'D', otherwise it prints 'R', which corresponds to the winning fraction.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
