Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem description. It maintains queues for both 'D' and 'R' employees, updates indices based on the value of n, and determines the majority party by checking which queue is empty at the end. The code handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately. Additionally, the output hints provide a summary of the code's functionality and align with the actual implementation. Thus, the code is correct.
