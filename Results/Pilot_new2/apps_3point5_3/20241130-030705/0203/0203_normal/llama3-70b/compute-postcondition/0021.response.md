Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string with at least one fraction, `republicans` and `remocrats` are counts of 'D' and non-'D' fractions respectively. If all fractions are 'D', `republicans` will be equal to the total number of fractions. If all fractions are not 'D', `remocrats` will be equal to the total number of fractions. If (republicans <= remocrats), then the program variables remain unchanged***
