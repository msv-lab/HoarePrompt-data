Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It counts the number of 'D' (depublicans) and non-'D' (remocrats) fractions and then compares the counts to determine the outcome of the vote. It correctly prints 'D' if the number of depublicans is greater than the number of remocrats, and 'R' otherwise.

The program follows the problem description as it accurately predicts the outcome of the vote based on the fractions of the employees and the order in which they make their statements.
