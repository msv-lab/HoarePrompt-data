    #The program returns the total time required for an item to move from `block_a` and `floor_a` to `block_b` and `floor_b` based on the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` where `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The function calculates the total time required for an item to move from `block_a` and `floor_a` to `block_b` and `floor_b` based on specific conditions. It determines the time to exit, walk times between blocks, and the time to the target floor, then sums these times to obtain the total time.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **apartment is an integer representing the number of an apartment in the round-shaped building, where 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k.**
def get_location(apartment):

    return block, floor
    #The program returns the block number of the apartment and the floor number within the block
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment`, representing the number of an apartment in a round-shaped building with specific constraints. It calculates and returns the block number and the floor number within that block of the given apartment. The function correctly handles the calculation of block and floor numbers based on the input apartment.
