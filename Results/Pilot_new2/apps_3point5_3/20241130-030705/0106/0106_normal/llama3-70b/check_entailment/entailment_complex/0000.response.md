Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the time taken to move between two points based on their floors and blocks, and then computes the total time required for the movement. The program handles all the cases described in the problem description and outputs the correct result. Hence, the program is correct.
