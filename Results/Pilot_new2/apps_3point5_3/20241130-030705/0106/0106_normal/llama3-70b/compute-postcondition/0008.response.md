Output State: **`n, m, k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, `a, b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b, `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split, `a_floor` is equal to ((a - 1) % m) + 1, `a_block` is equal to (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is equal to (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is equal to (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is equal to the minimum value between the absolute difference of `a_block` and `b_block` and `n - abs(a_block - b_block)` multiplied by 15, `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor, `min_floor_time` is equal to (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10.**
