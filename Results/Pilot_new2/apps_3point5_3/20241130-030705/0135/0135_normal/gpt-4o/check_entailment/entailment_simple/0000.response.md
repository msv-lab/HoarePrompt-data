Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It checks for distinct remainders of dividing 'n' by each 'i' from 1 to 'k'. If any remainder is repeated, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it stores all unique remainders in a set and returns 'Yes'. This logic aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description.
