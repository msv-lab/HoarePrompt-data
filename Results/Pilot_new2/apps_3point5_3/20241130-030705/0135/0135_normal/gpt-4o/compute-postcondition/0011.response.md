Output State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `k` is less than `n`, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `k`, and `i` is incremented by 1. `remainder` is updated to the new remainder of dividing `n` by the incremented `i`.
