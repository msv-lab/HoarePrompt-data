Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, iterates from 1 to `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, and checks if this remainder has been seen before. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it continues adding unique remainders to a set. If the loop completes without finding a repeated remainder, it prints 'Yes'. The program handles all potential cases and ensures that all remainders are distinct as required by the problem description.
