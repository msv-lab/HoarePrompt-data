Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
- It then iterates from 1 to `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, and checks if this remainder has been seen before.
- If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it continues adding unique remainders to a set.
- If the loop completes without finding a repeated remainder, it prints 'Yes'.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all cases.
