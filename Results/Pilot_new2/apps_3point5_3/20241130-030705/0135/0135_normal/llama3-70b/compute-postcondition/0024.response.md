Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, iterates from 1 to `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, and checks if this remainder has been seen before. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it continues adding unique remainders to a set. If the loop completes without finding a repeated remainder, it prints 'Yes'. This function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
