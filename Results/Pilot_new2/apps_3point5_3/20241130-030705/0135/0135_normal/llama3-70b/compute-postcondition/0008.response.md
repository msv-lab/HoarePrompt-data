Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen` is a set containing values of `n` modulo `i` where 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`; `k` must be greater than or equal to 1; `remainder` is equal to `n` modulo `i`. If the `remainder` is already present in the `seen` set, then the program prints 'No'.**
