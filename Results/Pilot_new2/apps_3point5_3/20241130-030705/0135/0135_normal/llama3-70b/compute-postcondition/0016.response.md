Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen` is a set containing values of `n` modulo `i` where 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`; `remainder` is equal to `n` modulo `i`; `k` must be greater than or equal to 1; the next `i` value should be less than or equal to `k` and greater than the previous `i`; if `remainder` is already in `seen`, there is no change to the `seen` set and `remainder` remains the same, and `remainder` has been added to `seen`. `remainder` is equal to `n` modulo `i`.**
