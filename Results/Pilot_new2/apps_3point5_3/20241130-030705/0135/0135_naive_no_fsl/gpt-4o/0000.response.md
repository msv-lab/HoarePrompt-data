Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input, checks if k is greater than or equal to n, then iterates through all values of i from 1 to k to calculate the remainders and checks if they are distinct. If any remainder is found to be already seen, it returns 'No', indicating that not all remainders are distinct. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and correctly determines if all remainders are distinct.
