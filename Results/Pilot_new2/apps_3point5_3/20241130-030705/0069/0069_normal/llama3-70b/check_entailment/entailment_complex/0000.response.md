Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input and calculates the balance of the string. Based on the balance and the desired balance `x`, it prints the correct number of prefixes or `-1` if there are an infinite number of prefixes. The program handles all cases as described in the problem description.
