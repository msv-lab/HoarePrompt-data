Postcondition: ***`T, x, s, cnt0, cnt1` remain the same, `n, x` are the integers obtained from splitting the input, `cnt0` is assigned the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is assigned the count of '1' in string `s`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If balance == x, `n` is increased by 1. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the code prints -1 and does not affect any variables. Otherwise, `T, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, n, x, cnt0, cnt1, balance, x` remain the same and `x` is incremented by 1.***
