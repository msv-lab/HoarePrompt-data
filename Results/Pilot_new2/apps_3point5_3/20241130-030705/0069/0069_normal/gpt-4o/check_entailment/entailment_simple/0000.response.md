Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with balance equal to $x as described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases, calculates the balance of each string $s$, determines the prefix balances based on the count of '0's and '1's in each prefix, and then counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance $x. The program also correctly handles cases where there might be an infinite number of such prefixes.

The program follows the problem description by maintaining the correct state of variables throughout each test case, and the logic implemented ensures that the correct results are calculated for all possible scenarios.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
