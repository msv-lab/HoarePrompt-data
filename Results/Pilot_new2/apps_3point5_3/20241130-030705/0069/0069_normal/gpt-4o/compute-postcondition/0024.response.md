Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the program variables will be as follows: $T$ remains the first integer value from the `data` list. `n` remains a positive integer equal to the first element of the `data` list. `x` remains an integer such that $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9. `s` remains a binary string of length $n. `data` remains a list containing the input values and is not empty. `index` is still assigned the value 4. `results` will contain either -1 or 0. `x` remains assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1`. `s` remains assigned the string value at `data[index + 2`. `balance` remains calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string $s. `prefix_balances` is a list of length $n + 1$ where each element is updated according to the formula `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` for all $i$ from 1 to $n$ inclusive. If `balance` is equal to 0, the program variables remain the same. If `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list, `results` will contain -1. If `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` list, `results` will contain 0.***
