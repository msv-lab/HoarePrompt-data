Output State: **T remains the first integer value from the `data` list, `n` will be the total number of iterations of the loop, `x` will be assigned the last integer value from the `data` list, `s` will be assigned the last binary string value from the `data` list, `data` will remain a list containing all input values, `index` will be the last index value after the loop finishes, `balance` will be the final difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the last binary string `s`, `prefix_balances` will be a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` will be calculated based on the last binary string value `s`, `results` will contain either -1 or 0 based on the conditions mentioned, and `count` will be the final count of satisfying the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0` for all elements in the `prefix_balances` list.**
