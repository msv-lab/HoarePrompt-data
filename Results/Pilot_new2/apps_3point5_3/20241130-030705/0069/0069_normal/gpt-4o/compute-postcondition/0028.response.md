Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in the list. If ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is true, then `x` is an integer, `balance` is a positive integer, and the current value of `x` satisfies the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0)***
