Output State: **$T$ is the first integer value from the `data` list, `n` is a positive integer equal to the first element of the `data` list, `x` is an integer such that $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9, $s$ is a binary string of length $n$, `data` is a list containing the input values and is not empty, `index` is assigned the value 4, `results` is an empty list, `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1`, `s` is assigned the string value at `data[index + 2`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string $s$, `prefix_balances` is a list of length $n + 1$ filled with zeros, `i` is 1. 
`prefix_balances[i]` is updated as `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`.
