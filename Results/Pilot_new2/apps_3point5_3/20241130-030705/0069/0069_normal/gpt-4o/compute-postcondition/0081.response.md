Output State: $T$ is now $T-1$, `n` is incremented by 1 and assigned the value of `data[8]`, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2].` `index` is increased by 3. `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`. `prefix_balances` is now a list of zeros with length equal to `n + 1`.
