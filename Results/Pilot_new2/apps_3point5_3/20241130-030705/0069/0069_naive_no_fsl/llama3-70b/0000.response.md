Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the balance of the prefix string is not equal to the desired balance $x$, and the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the current balance is not a multiple of the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in the string $s$. In such cases, the program should output -1, indicating an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance.

For example, consider the test case:
Input
1
3 2
111
Output
1

For this test case, the program should output -1 because there are an infinite number of prefixes with balance equal to 2. However, the program incorrectly outputs 1.
