Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`. The code sorts the list `a` and then iterates through the elements to check if a pair exists where their difference is also in the list. If such a pair does not exist, it increments a counter `m`. Finally, it returns the total count of pairs that didn't meet the condition.

The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly calculates the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations. It ensures that the values from the list `a` can be constructed using the sum of the existing variables, which is the objective of the problem. The algorithm efficiently checks for the presence of such pairs and increments the counter `m` accordingly. 

After assessing the code and considering the problem description, it can be concluded that the code is correct and produces the expected output for all potential cases.
