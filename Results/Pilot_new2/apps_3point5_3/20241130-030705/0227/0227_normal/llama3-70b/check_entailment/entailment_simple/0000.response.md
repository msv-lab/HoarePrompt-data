Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence `a`, then iterates through the sorted sequence checking if each element is equal to twice the previous element. If not, it increments the count of variables `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1.

The program follows the problem description by efficiently determining the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations as described.
