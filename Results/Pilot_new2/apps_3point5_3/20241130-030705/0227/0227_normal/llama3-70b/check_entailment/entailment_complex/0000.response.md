Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input integers, sorts them, and then iterates over the sorted list to count the number of times an element is not twice the previous element. The program then prints the count `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1. This approach guarantees the minimum number of variables `m` needed to perform the described sequence of operations. The program covers all possible cases as per the problem description.
