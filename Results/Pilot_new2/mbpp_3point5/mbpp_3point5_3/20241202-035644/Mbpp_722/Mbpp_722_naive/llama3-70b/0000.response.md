Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly filters the students based on the given condition of height and weight being above the minimum values. It iterates through each student in the dictionary and checks if both the height and weight are greater than or equal to the minimum values. If the condition is met, the student is included in the filtered result. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description.
