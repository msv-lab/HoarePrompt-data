The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a student name and the corresponding value is a tuple of two floats (student_height, student_weight). The function filters the student data based on the criteria that the student's height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, returning a new dictionary with the filtered student information.
