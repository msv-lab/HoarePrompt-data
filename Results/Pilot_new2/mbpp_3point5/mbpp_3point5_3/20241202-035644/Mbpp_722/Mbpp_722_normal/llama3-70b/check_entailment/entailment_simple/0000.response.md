Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in the student data dictionary, minimal height, and minimal weight as input parameters. It then filters the students based on the condition that their height is greater than or equal to the minimal height and their weight is greater than or equal to the minimal weight.

The program correctly returns a dictionary where each key is a student name and the corresponding value is a tuple of two floats (student_height, student_weight) for students who meet the specified conditions. This aligns with the problem description provided.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
