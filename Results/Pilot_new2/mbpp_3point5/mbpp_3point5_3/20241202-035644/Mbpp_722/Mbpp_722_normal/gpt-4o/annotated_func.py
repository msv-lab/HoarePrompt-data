#State of the program right berfore the function call: student_dict is a dictionary where keys are strings (student names) and values are tuples of two floats (student_height, student_weight). min_height and min_weight are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively.**
def func_1(student_dict, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in student_dict.
    items() if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
    #The program returns a dictionary with only the students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight, where student_dict is a dictionary with keys as student names and values as tuples of height and weight, and min_height and min_weight are the minimum height and weight respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a dictionary student_dict, and two floats min_height and min_weight. It then filters the student_dict to include only students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. The function returns a new dictionary with the filtered students. However, if the student_dict is empty or if the keys in student_dict are not strings or if the values in student_dict are not tuples of two floats, the function might not behave as expected.
