Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all the characters in the input string are the same or not. It first checks if the string is empty, in which case it returns True. Then it initializes the `first_char` variable with the first character of the string and iterates through the string checking if any character is different from the `first_char`. If a different character is found, it immediately returns False. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any different character, it returns True. The function has been tested with multiple cases, including 'python', 'aaa', and 'data', and it provides the expected results for all of them.
