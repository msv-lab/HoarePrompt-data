Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string to a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach correctly identifies whether all characters are the same in the string. The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function returns True if all characters in the string 's' are the same; otherwise, it returns False. Additionally, the hint mentions that if the input string is empty, the function will return True because there are no differing characters. The code appears to handle this case correctly as well.
