Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list as input and uses a list comprehension along with the `all` function to check if every element in the list is less than or equal to the next element. This logic accurately determines whether the specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The program covers all potential cases where the list is sorted and where it is not sorted, making it correct.
