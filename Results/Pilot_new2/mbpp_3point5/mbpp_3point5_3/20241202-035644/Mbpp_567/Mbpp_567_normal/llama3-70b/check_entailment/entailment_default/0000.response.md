Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` accepts a list of comparable elements and returns True if all elements in the list are in non-descending order (each element is less than or equal to the next element). The code uses the `all()` function along with a generator expression to check if each element is less than or equal to the next element in the list. This implementation correctly determines whether the specified list is sorted in non-descending order as per the given problem description. Additionally, the output hints align with the code and provide a clear understanding of the expected behavior of the function. Since no edge cases or scenarios contradicting the problem description were found, we can conclude that the code is correct.
