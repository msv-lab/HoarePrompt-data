Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function called `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and checks whether the list is sorted in non-descending order. It does so by using a list comprehension that iterates over the indices of the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element.

This approach correctly captures the essence of the problem description, as it accurately determines whether the input list is sorted or not based on the specified criteria. The program returns `True` if all elements in the list are in non-descending order and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
