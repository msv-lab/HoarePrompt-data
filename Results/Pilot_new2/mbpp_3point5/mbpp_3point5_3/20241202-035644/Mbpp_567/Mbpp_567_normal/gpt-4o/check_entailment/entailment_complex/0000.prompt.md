You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.**
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, if there are at least 2 elements in the list `lst`, then the elements in `lst` are in non-decreasing order. If there is only one element in `lst`, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes and finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the elements in list `lst` are in non-decreasing order after the loop executes. If there is only one element in `lst`, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes and finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. It iterates through the list and checks if the elements are in non-decreasing order. If the elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns True. If there is only one element in the list, the function returns True without executing the loop. If the loop finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it returns False. However, the function does not handle the case where the list is empty, so it may lead to unexpected behavior if an empty list is passed as input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
