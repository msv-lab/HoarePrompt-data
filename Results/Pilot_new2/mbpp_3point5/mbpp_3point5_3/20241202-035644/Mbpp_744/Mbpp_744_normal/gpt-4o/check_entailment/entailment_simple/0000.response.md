Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple as input and iterates through each element of the tuple. If it encounters a `None` value, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the tuple has a `None` value. If no `None` value is found in the tuple, it returns `False`.

This implementation correctly checks if the given tuple has any `None` value as specified in the problem description. It returns `True` if any `None` value is found and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
