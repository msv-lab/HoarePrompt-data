Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` correctly follows the problem description. The function accepts a tuple `tup` and iterates through its elements. If the first non-None element in `tup` is encountered, the function returns True. If there are no non-None elements in `tup`, the function returns False. The code handles all cases as described in the problem statement. All the provided examples also return the expected outputs, indicating that the code is correct.
