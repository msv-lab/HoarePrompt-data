Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input. It then uses the `any` function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple `tup` is None. If any element is None, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

This program meets the problem description as it accurately checks if the given tuple has any None value or not. The `any` function efficiently handles this check, making the program correct for all potential cases.
