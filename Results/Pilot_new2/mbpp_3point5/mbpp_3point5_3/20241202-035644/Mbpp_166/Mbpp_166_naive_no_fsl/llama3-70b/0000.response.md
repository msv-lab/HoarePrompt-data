Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly count the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. Here's a case where the program fails:
Input: [1, 2, 3]
Expected output: 1 (pair: (1, 3) -> 1 ^ 3 = 2)
Output by the program: 0

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
