Output State: **`nums` is still a list of integers with at least 1 element. `count` has been updated for each pair (i, j) where the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `i` is 2, and `j` is the last index of `nums` with `len(nums) >= i + 2`. The final value of `count` reflects the total number of pairs (i, j) where the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even.**
