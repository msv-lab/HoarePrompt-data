    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: After the loop finishes executing, `nums` is still a list of integers with at least 1 element. `count` is the total number of pairs (i, j) in the list `nums` where the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number. The final values of `i` and `j` are the last two indices of `nums`.

    #The program returns the total number of pairs (i, j) in the list `nums` where the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number. The final values of `i` and `j` are the last two indices of `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of integers nums and calculates the total number of pairs (i, j) in the list nums where the bitwise XOR of nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number. The final values of i and j are the last two indices of nums.
