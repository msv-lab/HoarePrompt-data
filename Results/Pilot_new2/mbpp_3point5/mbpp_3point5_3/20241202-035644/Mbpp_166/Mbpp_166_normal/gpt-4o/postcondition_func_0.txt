The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs. Even_pairs is the product of the count of even integers in the list multiplied by count - 1, divided by 2. Likewise, odd_pairs is calculated similarly. The function then returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs.
