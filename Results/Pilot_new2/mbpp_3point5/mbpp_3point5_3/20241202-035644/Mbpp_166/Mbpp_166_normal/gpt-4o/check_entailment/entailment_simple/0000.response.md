Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. It achieves this by first calculating the number of even and odd integers in the list. Then it calculates the number of pairs that can be formed from the even integers and odd integers separately. Finally, it returns the sum of these pairs.

The logic of counting pairs of integers that XOR to an even number is correctly implemented in the program, so it meets the requirements of the problem description.
