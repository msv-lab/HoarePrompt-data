Correctness: **False**

The code provided only covers specific cases for `n` values less than or equal to 4 and returns 0 for all other cases. This does not align with the problem description, which specifies that the function should find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The code does not compute the factorial of `n` or return the last digit of the factorial as required. Thus, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
