The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. 

Case_1: If `n` is less than 2, the function returns the current value of `n`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0.

Case_2: If `n` is either 2 or 3, the function returns the value of `n`.

Case_3: If `n` is 4, the function returns the integer 4.

Case_4: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` greater than or equal to 0, and return different values based on the conditions specified above.
