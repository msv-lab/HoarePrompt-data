#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0.**
def func_1(n):

        return n
        #The program returns the current value of n, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. If n is less than 2, then the current value of n is less than 2
    else :
        if (n == 2 or n == 3) :
            return n
            #The program returns n, which is either 2 or 3
        else :
            if (n == 4) :
                return 4
                #The program returns the integer 4

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. It returns different values based on the following conditions: 
- If `n` is less than 2, the function returns the current value of `n`.
- If `n` is either 2 or 3, the function returns the value of `n`.
- If `n` is 4, the function returns the integer 4.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 0.
The function does not cover cases where `n` is greater than 4, so it always returns 0 for values of `n` greater than 4.
