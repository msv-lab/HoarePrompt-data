The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and has two cases:
- Case 1: If the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0.
- Case 2: If the current value of `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, and return the last digit of the factorial if `n` is less than 5.
