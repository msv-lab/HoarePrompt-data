According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and less than 5, `factorial` is equal to 6, `i` is 2. Since the loop will execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` would be 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `factorial` is equal to 6, `i` is 3**
