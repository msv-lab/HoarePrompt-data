Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly finds the last digit in the factorial of a given number. It first checks if the input number is greater than or equal to 5, in which case it returns 0 as the last digit of the factorial will always be 0 for numbers greater than or equal to 5. 
If the input number is less than 5, it calculates the factorial of the number and returns the last digit of the factorial by taking the remainder when divided by 10. This approach is correct as the last digit of the factorial is what is required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description correctly for all potential cases and always returns the last digit of the factorial of a given number as required.
