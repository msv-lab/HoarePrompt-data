The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The function has two cases: 
- Case 1: If the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0.
- Case 2: If the current value of `n` is less than 5, the function returns 4, as the remainder of 24 divided by 10 is 4.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `n` is less than 5, the function returns 4.
