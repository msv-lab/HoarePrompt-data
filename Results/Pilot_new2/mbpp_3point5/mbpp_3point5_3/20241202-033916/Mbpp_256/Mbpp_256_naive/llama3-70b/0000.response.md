Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program defines a function that takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. The inner helper function `is_prime` correctly determines if a number is prime or not by checking all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. The outer function then iterates through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` and counts the prime numbers correctly. Since the program follows the problem description and the logic is sound, it correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than the given input `n`.
