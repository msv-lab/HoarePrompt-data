According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step size of `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is the next value after the last iteration, `is_prime[j]` is False. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next value after `j` within the range of `i * i` to `n` must have `is_prime` as False.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[i]` is False, `j` is the next value after the last iteration, `is_prime[j]` is False, Next value after `j` within the range of `i * i` to `n` must have `is_prime` as False**
