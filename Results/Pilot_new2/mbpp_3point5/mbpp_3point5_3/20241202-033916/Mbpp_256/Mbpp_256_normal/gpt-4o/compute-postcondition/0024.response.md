According to the code, the loop is iterating over the range from 2 to the square root of `n` and the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. So in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 4.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values except for `is_prime[0] = False` and `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 4**
