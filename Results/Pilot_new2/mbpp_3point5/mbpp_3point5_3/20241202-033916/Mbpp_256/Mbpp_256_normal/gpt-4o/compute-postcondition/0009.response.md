According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range starting from `i * i`, incrementing by `i`, until `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than `i * i`, and `is_prime[i]` is False.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[i]` is False, `j` is the next value after the last iteration**
