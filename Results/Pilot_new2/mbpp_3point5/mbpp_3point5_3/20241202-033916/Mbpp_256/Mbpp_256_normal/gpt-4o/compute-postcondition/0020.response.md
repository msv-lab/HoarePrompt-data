According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range `[i * i, n)` and is incremented by `i` each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value within the range `[i * i, n)` after being incremented by `i`.

Since the next value of `j` should be `i * i + i = 3 * 3 + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15`, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[j] = False**
