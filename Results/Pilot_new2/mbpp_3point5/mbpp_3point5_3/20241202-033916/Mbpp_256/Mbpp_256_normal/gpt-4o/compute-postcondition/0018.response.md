According to the code, the loop will execute for the next value of `j` starting from `i * i` and incrementing by `i` until `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 9. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to find the next valid value for `j` based on the current state.

Since `i` is 3, the next value of `j` based on the loop incrementation is 12 (9 + 3). Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, `is_prime[j] = False**
