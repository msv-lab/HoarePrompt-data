According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, since the loop updates the `is_prime` list, the next element in the list that needs to be processed is at index `i+1`. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 3**.
