Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code first checks if the input number `n` is less than or equal to 2, in which case it returns 0, as specified in the problem description.
- For `n` greater than 2, the code correctly generates a list `is_prime` where multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n` are marked as `False`.
- The code then returns the sum of the `is_prime` values, which represent the count of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also align with the code logic. The examples provided in the problem description also seem to work correctly.
