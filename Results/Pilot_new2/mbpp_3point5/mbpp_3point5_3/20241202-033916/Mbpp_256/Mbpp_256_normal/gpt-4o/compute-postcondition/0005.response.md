According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2. The loop range is from 2 to the square root of `n` + 1. So, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False, i is 2**
