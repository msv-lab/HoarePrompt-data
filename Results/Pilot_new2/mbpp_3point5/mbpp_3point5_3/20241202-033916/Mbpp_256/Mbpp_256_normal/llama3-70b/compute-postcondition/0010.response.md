According to the code, the loop can execute again if `num` is not divisible by `i + 1` and if `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer, `num` is greater than or equal to 4, `num` is not divisible by `i + 1` where the loop variable `i` has reached a value. To execute the loop one more time, we need to:
- Increase the value of `i` by 1.
- Ensure that `num` is not divisible by the new value of `i + 1`.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num` is greater than or equal to 4, `num` is not divisible by the new value of `i + 1`**
