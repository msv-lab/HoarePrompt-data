According to the code, the loop will execute if `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `num` is already given to be greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, the loop range depends on `num`, so for the loop to execute, `num` must be such that the range `(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)` contains at least one element. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `num` must be at least 4.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num` is greater than or equal to 4**
