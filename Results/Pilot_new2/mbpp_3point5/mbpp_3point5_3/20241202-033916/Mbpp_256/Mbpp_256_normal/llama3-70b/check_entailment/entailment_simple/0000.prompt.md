You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `num` is equal to or greater than `n`.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n` (inclusive).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a non-negative integer.**
def is_prime(num):
    if (num < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *num is a non-negative integer. num is greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the loop executes, then `num` is a non-negative integer and a prime number, as the loop checks for divisibility from 2 to the square root of `num`. If the loop does not execute, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4 and is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`.
    return True
    #The program returns True as the condition for the execution of the loop implies that `num` is a non-negative prime number.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
