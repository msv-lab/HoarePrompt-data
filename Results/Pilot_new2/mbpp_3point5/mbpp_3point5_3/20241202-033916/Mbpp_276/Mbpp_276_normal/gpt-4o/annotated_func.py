#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.**
def func_1(radius, height):
    volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume calculated by multiplying math.pi with the value of radius
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cylinder given the `radius` and `height` as non-negative numbers by using the formula `volume = math.pi * radius^2 * height`. The function returns the calculated volume. However, the function assumes that the `math` module has been imported for the calculation.
