Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and calculates the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. This formula correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height, which aligns with the problem description. The function also uses the math module to access the value of pi for the calculation, which is accurate. Additionally, the formula is valid for all non-negative values of radius and height, which covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
