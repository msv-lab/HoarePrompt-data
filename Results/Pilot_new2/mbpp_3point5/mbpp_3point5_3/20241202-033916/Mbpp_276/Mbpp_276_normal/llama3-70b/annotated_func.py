#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.**
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the result of math.pi multiplied by the square of radius and height
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius
