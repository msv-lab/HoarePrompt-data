Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` after converting the tuple elements into a list. The code correctly adds the given tuple to the given list as per the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code, confirming the correctness of the program.
