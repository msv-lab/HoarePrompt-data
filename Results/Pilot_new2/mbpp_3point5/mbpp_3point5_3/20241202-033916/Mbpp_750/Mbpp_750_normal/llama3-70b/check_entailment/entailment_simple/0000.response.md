Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function described in the problem description. It takes a list and a tuple as input, converts the tuple to a list, and then concatenates it with the original list. This way, it adds the elements of the tuple to the list just as the problem description specifies. The program consistently follows the problem description for all cases.
