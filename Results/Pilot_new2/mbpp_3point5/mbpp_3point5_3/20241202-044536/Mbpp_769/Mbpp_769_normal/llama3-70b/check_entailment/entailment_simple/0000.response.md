Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by using the XOR operator (^) between the sets created from list1 and list2 to get the unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2 but not in both. The program then sorts the resulting list before returning it. This implementation ensures that the program gets the difference between two lists as required.
