Correctness: **False**

The code does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case. The description states that the function should return the difference between two lists by finding elements that are present in either list1 or list2 but not in both. However, the code provided finds the symmetric difference between the two sets, which includes elements that are in either list1 or list2, but not in both, as well as elements that are in both lists.

For example, when considering the input [1, 2, 3] and [6, 7, 1], the expected output should be [2, 3, 6, 7]. However, the code provided returns [2, 3, 6, 7, 1], as it includes the element '1' which is present in both lists.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
