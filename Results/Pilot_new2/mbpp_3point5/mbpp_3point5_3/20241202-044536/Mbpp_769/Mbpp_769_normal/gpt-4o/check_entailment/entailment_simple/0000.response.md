Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input. It then converts each list into a set, finds the symmetric difference between the two sets to get the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, and then converts the result set back into a list. Finally, it sorts the result list based on the index of the elements in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the difference between two lists and sorts the result list based on the index in the combined list. It handles all potential cases and correctly implements the desired functionality.
