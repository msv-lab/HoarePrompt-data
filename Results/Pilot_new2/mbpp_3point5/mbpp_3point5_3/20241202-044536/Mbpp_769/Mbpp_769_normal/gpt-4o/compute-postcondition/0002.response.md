Example Answer:
The `diff_elements` set is assigned the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. The symmetric difference contains elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. The previous values of `list1`, `list2`, `set1`, and `set2` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of any data type, `set1` is a set containing the elements of `list1`, `set2` is a set containing the elements of `list2`, `diff_elements` contains elements that are in either `set1` or `set2` but not in both.**
