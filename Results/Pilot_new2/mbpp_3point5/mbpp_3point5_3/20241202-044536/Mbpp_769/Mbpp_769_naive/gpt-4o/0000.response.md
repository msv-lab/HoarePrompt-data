Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not return the correct difference between two lists as described in the problem statement. The logic used to sort the result list is incorrect and does not guarantee the correct order of elements based on the input lists. 

For example, consider the input lists:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [6, 7, 1]

The expected output based on the problem description should be [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] but the program returns [2, 3, 6, 7]. This discrepancy shows that the program does not handle the case correctly where all unique elements from both lists need to be sorted in the output list.
