Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function recursively flattens a given nested list structure by iterating through each element. If the element is a list, it calls the function recursively on that element. If the element is not a list, it appends it to the `flat_list`. This logic covers all potential cases of nested lists and correctly flattens them as per the problem description.
