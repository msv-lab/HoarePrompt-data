According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 3 items, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 2 items. 

To execute the loop one more time, the nested_list must have at least 3 items. If the item is a list, then flat_list should be extended/modified by adding the result of func_1(item) to it. If the item is not a list, then flat_list should be extended/modified by adding the new item.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 3 items.**
