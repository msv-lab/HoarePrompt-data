According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the nested_list. If there are more elements left in the nested_list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, nested_list has at least 2 elements. If the next element is a list, flat_list will contain the elements returned by func_1(element). If the next element is not a list, flat_list will contain the first element of nested_list extended by func_1(element) in the if part. If the next element is not a list, flat_list will contain the first element of nested_list with the appended element in the else part. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the nested_list must have at least 3 elements and the loop will process the next element in the list based on the conditions mentioned above.

State: **nested_list is a list with at least 3 elements**
