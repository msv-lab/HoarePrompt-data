Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively processing each element in the list. It checks if the element is a list, then recursively calls the function on that element until all nested lists are flattened. The program then appends the non-list elements to the flat_list. This logic covers all potential cases of nested lists and correctly flattens them.
