Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function that replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20' using the `replace` method. The program then has assertions to test the function with different input strings and compare the output with the expected output. For all the provided test cases, the program correctly replaces spaces with '%20' and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
