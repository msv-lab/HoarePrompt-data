Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in the program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20', as described in the problem description. The implementation of the `func_1` function utilizes the `replace` method in Python to replace all occurrences of a space with '%20', ensuring that it follows the problem description for all potential cases. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the function returns the input string with all spaces replaced by '%20'. Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
