Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function named `func_1` that takes an input string and replaces all spaces in the string with '%20'. The code uses the `replace()` method in Python, which correctly replaces all occurrences of a specified value in a string with another value. The code seems to be fulfilling the problem description accurately.

The output hints also align with the functionality of the code, stating that the function accepts a parameter `input_string` and returns the `input_string` after replacing all spaces with '%20'. The examples provided in the problem description also show that the code correctly replaces spaces with '%20' as expected.

Therefore, based on both the code itself and the output hints, it appears that the code is correct for all potential cases, and the function `func_1` works as intended.
