Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method in Python. The output hints also confirm that the function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the uppercase version of the string `s`. Since the code exactly follows the problem description and the output hints agree with the code behavior, we can conclude that the code is correct. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description or output hints that the code does not handle correctly.
