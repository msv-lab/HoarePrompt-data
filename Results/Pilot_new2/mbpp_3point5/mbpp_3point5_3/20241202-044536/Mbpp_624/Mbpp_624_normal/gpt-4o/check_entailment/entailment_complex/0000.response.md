Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the uppercase version of the string `s`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The `s.upper()` method in the program converts the string `s` to uppercase, fulfilling the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
