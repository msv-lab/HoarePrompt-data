Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the elements of the tuple `tup` and counts the number of elements in the tuple before encountering the first tuple. Once a tuple is encountered, the loop breaks, and the count is returned. If the tuple has no tuples inside, it will return the total number of elements in the tuple. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is correctly implemented according to the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned where the code would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
