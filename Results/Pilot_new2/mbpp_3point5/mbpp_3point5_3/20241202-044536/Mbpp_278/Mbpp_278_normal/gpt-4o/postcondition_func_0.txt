The function func_1 accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple, and iterates through the elements of the tuple. It counts the number of elements in the tuple before encountering the first tuple or breaking the loop due to a condition in the if statement. The function then returns this count. If the tuple has no tuples inside, it will return the total number of elements in the tuple.
