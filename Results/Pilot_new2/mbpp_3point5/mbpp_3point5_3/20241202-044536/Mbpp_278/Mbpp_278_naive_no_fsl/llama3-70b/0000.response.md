Correctness: False

The code provided does not follow the problem description. The function should find the number of elements that occur before the tuple element, not the index of the tuple element itself. Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Example:
Input: (1, 2, (3, 4), 5, 6, (7, 8))
Expected Output: [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
Output by the program: 2

In this case, the program should return [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] but it incorrectly returns 2.
