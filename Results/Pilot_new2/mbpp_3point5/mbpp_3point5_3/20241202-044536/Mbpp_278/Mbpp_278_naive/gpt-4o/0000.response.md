Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of elements that occur before a tuple element in the given tuple. It iterates through each element in the tuple and increments the count until it encounters a tuple element, at which point it stops and returns the count. The provided test cases also pass successfully, confirming that the function works as expected for all potential cases.
