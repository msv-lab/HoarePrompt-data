Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer arguments `a` and `b` and returns the maximum value between the two using the `max` function. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a Python function to find the maximum of two numbers. Since the program consistently returns the maximum value between the two integers provided as inputs, it is correct and meets the problem description.
