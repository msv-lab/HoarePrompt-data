Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided implements a function that takes in two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them using the built-in `max()` function, which is a correct way to find the maximum of two numbers. The function accurately follows the problem description, which is to find the maximum of two numbers. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function indeed accepts two integer parameters and returns the maximum value between them. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, and there are no edge cases where it fails to produce the correct output, the correctness of the code is true.
