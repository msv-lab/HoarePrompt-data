Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function func_1 that takes in two integer parameters a and b and returns the greater value between them. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to find the maximum of two numbers. The program accurately follows the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
