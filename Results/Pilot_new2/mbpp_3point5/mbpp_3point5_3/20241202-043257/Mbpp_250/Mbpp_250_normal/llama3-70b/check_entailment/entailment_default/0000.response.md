Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` correctly follows the problem description. The function simply uses the `count` method of tuples in Python to count the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The output hints also agree with the code, as they describe the function as accepting a tuple 'tup' and an element 'elem', and returning the number of times 'elem' appears in the tuple 'tup'. Since the code accurately implements the described functionality and there are no edge cases mentioned that are not covered, the correctness of the code is considered to be True.
