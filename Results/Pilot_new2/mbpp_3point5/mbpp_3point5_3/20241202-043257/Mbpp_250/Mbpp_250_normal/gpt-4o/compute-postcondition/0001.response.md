The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `element`, which can be any valid Python data type. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, then return the number of times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, then returns the number of times `element` appears in the tuple `tup`.**
