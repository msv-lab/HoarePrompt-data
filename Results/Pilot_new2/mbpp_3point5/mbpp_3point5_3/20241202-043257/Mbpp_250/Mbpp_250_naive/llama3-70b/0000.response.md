Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, then uses the built-in `count` function of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This implementation directly meets the requirements of counting the occurrences of the element in the tuple, and there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by this simple and direct approach. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
