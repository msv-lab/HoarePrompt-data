The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the program returns two lists. The first list contains the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements, and return two lists containing the first and second elements of each sublist respectively.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns two lists. The first list contains the first element of each sublist in list_of_lists, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist in list_of_lists.**
