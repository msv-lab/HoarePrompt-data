Correctness: **True**

The program correctly takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The list comprehension used in the program ensures that each sublist is processed as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for.
