Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `num` and returns its polar coordinates (r, phi) using the `cmath` library. **

Note: The annotation states that `num` is a complex number before the function call, but it does not explicitly import the `cmath` library. Therefore, it is assumed that the `cmath` library is imported elsewhere in the code.
