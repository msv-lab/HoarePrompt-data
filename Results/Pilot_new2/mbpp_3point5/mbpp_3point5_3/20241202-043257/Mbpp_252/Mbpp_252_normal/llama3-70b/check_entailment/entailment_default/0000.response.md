Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` accepts a complex number `c` and returns its absolute value (magnitude) using `abs(c)` and its phase using `cmath.phase(c)`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description that asks for the conversion of complex numbers to polar coordinates. 
Furthermore, the output hints also confirm that the function returns the absolute value and phase of the complex number, which is consistent with the code implementation. 
There are no edge cases or scenarios identified where the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Hence, the code is correct.
