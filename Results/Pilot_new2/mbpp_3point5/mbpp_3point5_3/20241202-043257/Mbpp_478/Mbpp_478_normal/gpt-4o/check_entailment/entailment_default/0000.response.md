Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Although the code removes lowercase characters from the string, it does not preserve the original order of the characters in the string. For example, the input 'STRinG' should return 'STRG' according to the problem description, but the current implementation returns 'SGRT' as it only checks for uppercase characters and ignores the lowercase characters completely.
