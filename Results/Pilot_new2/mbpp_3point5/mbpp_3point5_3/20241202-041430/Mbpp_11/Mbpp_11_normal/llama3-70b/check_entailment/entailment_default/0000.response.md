Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to follow the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` and a character `c`, then removes the characters at the indices of the first and last occurrences of character `c` in the string `s` and returns the modified string. If the character `c` is not found in the string `s`, the function simply returns the original string `s`. 

Upon analyzing the code and the problem description, it appears that the code handles all potential cases as specified. The logic implemented correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string. Additionally, there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned that the code does not address. Hence, the code seems to be correct in its implementation.
