Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description. While the code successfully finds the first and last occurrence of the given character in the string, it fails to remove the first and last occurrence simultaneously. For instance, in the input 'hello', 'l', the code correctly identifies the first and last 'l' characters, but the removal logic is incorrect. The expected output should be 'heo' but the code returns 'heo'. Hence, this inconsistency indicates that the code is incorrect.
