#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a character.**
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string s
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is a string, ch is a character, first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found in s, last_index is the index of the last occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found in s. first_index is not -1, last_index is not -1, and first_index is not equal to last_index.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns the string 's' with the characters at index first_index and last_index removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes in a string `s` and a character `ch`. It then finds the first and last index of character `ch` in the string `s`. If either index is -1 or they are the same, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it returns the modified string `s` with the characters at the first and last index of `ch` removed.
