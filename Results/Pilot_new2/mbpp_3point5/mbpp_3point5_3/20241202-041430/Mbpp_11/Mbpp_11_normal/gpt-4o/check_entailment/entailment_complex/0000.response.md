Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not completely fulfill the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character in most cases, it fails to do so when the character appears only once in the string. 

Specifically, if the character `ch` appears only once in the string `s`, the program will incorrectly return the original string `s` instead of removing the single occurrence. This is because the condition `if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index):` will evaluate to `False`, leading to the modified string being returned.

Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for, making it incorrect.
