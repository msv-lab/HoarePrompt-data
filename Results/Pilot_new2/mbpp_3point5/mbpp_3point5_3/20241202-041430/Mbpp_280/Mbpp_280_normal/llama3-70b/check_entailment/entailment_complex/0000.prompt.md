You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list and elem is any data type.**
def func_1(arr, elem):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == elem:
            return True, i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the loop executes, the output state will be True and the index of the first occurrence of elem in arr. If elem is not present in arr, the output state will be False. If arr is an empty list, the output state will be False.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False and -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and a data `elem`. It then iterates through the list to find the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is found, the function returns True along with the index of `elem` in the list. If `elem` is not found, the function returns False along with -1. The functionality description provided in the annotations covers the cases where `elem` is found at different positions in the list, but it doesn't cover the case where the list `arr` is empty. In that case, the function will always return False and -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
