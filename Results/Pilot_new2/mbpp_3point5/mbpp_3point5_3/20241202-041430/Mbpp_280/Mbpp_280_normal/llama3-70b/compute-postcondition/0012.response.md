The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `arr` which is a list and `elem` which can be any data type. 

Case_1: If the first element in the list `arr` is equal to `elem`, the function returns True along with the index of the first element in the list.

Case_2: If the first element in the list `arr` is not equal to `elem`, the function returns True along with the value of `i`, which is 1.

Case_3: If the second element in the list `arr` is not equal to `elem`, the function returns True along with the value of `i`, which is 2.

Case_4: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns False along with -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `arr` and a data `elem`, and based on the conditions described, return True along with the specified values or return False along with -1.
