Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly iterates through the array and checks if the element is equal to the current element in the iteration. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple with boolean True and the index position. If it doesn't find the element in the array, it returns a tuple with boolean False and index -1. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and works correctly for all inputs.
