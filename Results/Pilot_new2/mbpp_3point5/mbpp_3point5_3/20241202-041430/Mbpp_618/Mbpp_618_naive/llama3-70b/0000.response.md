Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` first checks if the lengths of both input lists are the same. If they are not the same, it raises a `ValueError`, which is inline with the problem description. Then, it proceeds to divide the elements of the two lists element-wise using a list comprehension with `zip()` function, which pairs up elements from both lists. This implementation follows the problem description of dividing two lists element-wise. There are no edge cases or input scenarios provided in the problem description that would cause this implementation to fail, so the correctness is deemed to be true.
