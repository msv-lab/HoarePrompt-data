Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` of the same length containing numerical elements and divides the elements element-wise using a list comprehension with `zip()`. This results in a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`, which aligns with the problem description. The program always performs the division as specified, making it correct.
