#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of the same length containing numerical elements.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return [(a / b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. Both list1 and list2 are lists of the same length containing numerical elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists `list1` and `list2` containing numerical elements of the same length. It then returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. The function assumes that the lists are of the same length and contain numerical elements.
