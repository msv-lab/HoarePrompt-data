You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to divide two lists element wise.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of the same length containing numerical elements.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return [(a / b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. Both list1 and list2 are lists of the same length containing numerical elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists `list1` and `list2` containing numerical elements of the same length. It then returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. The function assumes that the lists are of the same length and contain numerical elements.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
