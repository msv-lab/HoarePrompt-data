Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` takes in two lists of equal length and performs element-wise division on each pair of elements from the two lists. If the input lists are not of the same length, a ValueError is raised, as specified in the problem description. The code correctly handles this case by checking if the lengths of the two input lists are equal before performing the division. Additionally, the code uses list comprehension along with the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both lists simultaneously, ensuring that the division is done element-wise. In all valid cases, the code follows the problem description and produces the expected output.
