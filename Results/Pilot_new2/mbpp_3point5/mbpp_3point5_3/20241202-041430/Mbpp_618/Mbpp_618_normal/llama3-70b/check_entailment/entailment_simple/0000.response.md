Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the annotated code correctly divides two lists element-wise. It first checks if the two input lists are of equal length, and if they are not, it raises a ValueError as specified in the problem description. If the lists are of equal length, it then performs element-wise division using a list comprehension and returns a new list containing the results.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and produces the desired output when given two lists of equal length.
