Correctness: **True**

The annotated program clearly states that the function `func_1` accepts two lists of equal length containing integers or floats. It then performs element-wise division on each pair of elements from the two lists and returns a new list. If the input lists are not of the same length, a ValueError is raised with the message "Both lists must be of the same length". This aligns perfectly with the problem description, making the program correct.
