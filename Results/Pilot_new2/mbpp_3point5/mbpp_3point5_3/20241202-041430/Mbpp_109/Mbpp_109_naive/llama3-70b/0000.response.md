Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly handles the problem description. It rotates the binary string 's' the given number of times 'n', counts the number of '1's in each rotation, and determines if the count is odd. The program repeats the string 's' to ensure that it covers all possible rotations. The count of odd '1's is correctly calculated for each rotation, and the final count is returned as expected. For all potential cases, the program follows the problem description accurately.
