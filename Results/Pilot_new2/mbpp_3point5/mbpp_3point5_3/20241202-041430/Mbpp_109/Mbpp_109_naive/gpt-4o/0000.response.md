Correctness: **True**

I believe the provided program is correct for all potential cases. The function `func_1` rotates the binary string the given number of times and counts the number of odd values. The logic seems sound, and the provided test cases also pass successfully. Therefore, I cannot think of any case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
