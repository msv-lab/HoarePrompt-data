#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string and n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a binary string, `count` is updated to the total count of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `len(s)` modulo 2, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, `temp` is the substring of `s` of length `len(s)`
    return count
    #The program returns the total count of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `len(s)` modulo 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a binary string s and a non-negative integer n. It then repeats the binary string s by concatenating it until its length is at least n. Next, it counts the total number of '1's in all substrings of s with a length equal to the length of s, and calculates this count modulo 2. Finally, the function returns this count.
