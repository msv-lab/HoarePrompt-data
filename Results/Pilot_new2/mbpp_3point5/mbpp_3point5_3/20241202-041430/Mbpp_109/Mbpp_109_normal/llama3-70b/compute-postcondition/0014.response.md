Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a binary string s and a non-negative integer n. It then repeats the binary string s by concatenating it until its length is at least n. Next, it counts the total number of '1's in all substrings of s with a length equal to the length of s, and calculates this count modulo 2. Finally, the function returns this count.**
