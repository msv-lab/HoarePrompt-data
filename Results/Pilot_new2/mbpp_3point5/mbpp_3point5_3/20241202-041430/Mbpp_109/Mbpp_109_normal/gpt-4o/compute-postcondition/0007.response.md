According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is the result of shifting the binary number one position to the right, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 1, `integer_value` is the decimal conversion of `binary_str` and it is odd. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `num_rotations` must be greater than 0.
State: **`binary_str` is the result of shifting the binary number one position to the right, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `count` is 1, `integer_value` is the decimal conversion of `binary_str` and it is odd (integer_value % 2 == 1)**
