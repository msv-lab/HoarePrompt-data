Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`. The function then shifts the binary string to the right based on the `num_rotations` value, calculates the decimal value of each shifted string, and counts the number of times the result is an odd number. Finally, the function returns the count of odd decimal values.

This implementation correctly follows the problem description by finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. The program ensures that the binary string is shifted the specified number of times, calculates the decimal value of each shifted string, and correctly counts the odd decimal values.

Therefore, the program is correct as it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
