Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `binary_str` and the number of rotations `num_rotations` as input.
- It then rotates the binary string to the right `num_rotations` times, converts the rotated string to an integer value, and checks if the integer value is odd.
- The function correctly counts the number of times the resulting integer value is odd and returns this count.
- The code implementation aligns with the problem description provided, and there are no edge cases identified where the code would not behave as expected. 
- The output hints also validate the approach taken by the code in terms of calculating the decimal value and identifying odd numbers after rotation.
