Correctness: True

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` and an integer `n` as input. The function calculates the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating the binary string `s` the given number of times `n`.

The program correctly handles the rotation of the binary string by repeating it as `s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)` to ensure that we have enough characters to rotate. Then, it iterates through the rotated string and counts the number of '1's in each segment, incrementing the count if the count of '1's is odd.

Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, it can be considered correct.
