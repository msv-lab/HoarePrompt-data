According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list has at least 3 sublists, the loop will execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, list_of_lists has at least 2 sublists, max_length is equal to the length of the second sublist, sublist is the second sublist in list_of_lists. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 sublists, max_length is equal to the length of the third sublist, and sublist is the third sublist in the list.
State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sublists, max_length is equal to the length of the third sublist in list_of_lists, sublist is the third sublist in list_of_lists**
