Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It then iterates over the sublists to find the length of the longest sublist and returns that length. The code correctly returns the length of the longest sublist in the input list of lists. Additionally, the given test cases also confirm that the code is working as expected and providing the correct output for each case. Since the code aligns with the problem description and passes the test cases, we can conclude that the code is correct.
