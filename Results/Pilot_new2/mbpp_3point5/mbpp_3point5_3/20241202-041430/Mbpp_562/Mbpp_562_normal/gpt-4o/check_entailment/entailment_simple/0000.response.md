Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and correctly finds the length of the longest sublist within the list. It iterates over each sublist in the input list, compares the length of each sublist to the current maximum length, and updates the maximum length if a longer sublist is found. Finally, it returns the length of the longest sublist.

The program follows the problem description accurately by finding the length of the longest sublist, making it correct.
