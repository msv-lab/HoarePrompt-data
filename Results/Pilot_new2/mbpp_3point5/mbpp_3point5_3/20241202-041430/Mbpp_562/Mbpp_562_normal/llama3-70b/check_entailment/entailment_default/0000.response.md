Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the maximum length of the sublists within the list of lists. The code achieves this by utilizing a generator expression within the `max` function to iterate over all sublists and calculate their lengths, finally returning the maximum length.

The output hints also align with the code description, stating that the function accurately calculates and returns the maximum length of the sublists as indicated in the code. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases present in the context of this problem. Therefore, based on both the code and the output hints, it can be concluded that the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
