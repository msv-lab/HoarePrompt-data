Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly iterates through each sublist in the `list_of_lists` and keeps track of the maximum length found so far. It then returns the maximum length. The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as sublists of different lengths and the function passes all of them successfully. Hence, the program is correct.
