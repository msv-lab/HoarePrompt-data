Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists of numbers with the same length. The function then returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of dividing two lists element-wise. The use of list comprehension and the `zip` function ensures that the division is done element-wise. Therefore, the program is correct.
