Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists `list1` and `list2`. It first checks if the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are equal. If they are not equal, it raises a `ValueError`. Otherwise, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`.

The program always divides the elements of `list1` by the elements of `list2` element-wise, as long as the lengths of the two lists are the same. The implementation aligns with the problem description provided, making the program correct.
