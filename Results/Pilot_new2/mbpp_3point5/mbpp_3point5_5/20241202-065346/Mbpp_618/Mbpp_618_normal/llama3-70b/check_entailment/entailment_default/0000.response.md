Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and divides the elements of `list1` by the corresponding elements in `list2`. If the lengths of both lists are not equal, the function raises a `ValueError` stating that both lists must be of the same length. The code follows the problem description accurately and handles the edge case of lists with different lengths. The output hints align with the code as well, confirming that the function behaves as expected. Thus, based on the code and problem description, the correctness of the program is true.
