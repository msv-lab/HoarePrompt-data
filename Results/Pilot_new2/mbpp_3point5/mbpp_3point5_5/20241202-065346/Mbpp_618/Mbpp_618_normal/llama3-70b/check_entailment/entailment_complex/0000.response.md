Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function `func_1` according to the problem description. It first checks if the lengths of both input lists are equal. If they are not equal, it raises a `ValueError` as specified in the problem description. If the lengths are equal, it then proceeds to create a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`.

Therefore, the program always divides two lists element wise as required by the problem description.
