Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes two lists as input and divides the elements of the lists element-wise. The program uses list comprehension and the `zip()` function to iterate through the elements of both lists simultaneously. It then divides the corresponding elements and returns a new list with the results. The provided test cases cover various scenarios like dividing integers and floating-point numbers, handling different list lengths, and the division of different numbers. The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.
