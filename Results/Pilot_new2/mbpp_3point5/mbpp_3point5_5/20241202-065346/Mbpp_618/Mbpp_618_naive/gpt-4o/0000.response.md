Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two lists and divides the elements of the lists element-wise using list comprehension and the `zip` function. The function then returns the resulting list of division. The program has provided test cases with expected outputs that match the description of the problem. The function is correctly dividing the elements of the lists as per the problem description for all the provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
