Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the problem description. While it removes the first occurrence of the given character, it does not correctly remove the last occurrence. 

The line `return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]` should be modified to `return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1 + 1:]` to correctly remove the last occurrence of the character. 

Therefore, since the program does not fully comply with the problem description, the correctness is **False**.
