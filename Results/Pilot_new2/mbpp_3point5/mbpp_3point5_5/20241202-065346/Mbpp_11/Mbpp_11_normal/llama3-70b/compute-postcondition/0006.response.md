The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `c`. `s` is a string and `c` is a character. 

Case_1: If the character `c` is found at multiple positions within the string `s`, the function removes the first and last occurrences of `c` from the string `s` and returns the modified string.

Case_2: If the character `c` is not found within the string `s`, the function simply returns the original string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, and return the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of the character `c` removed if it appears multiple times, otherwise it returns the original string `s`.
