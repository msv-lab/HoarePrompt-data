Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a character `c`. If the character `c` is found at multiple positions within the string `s`, the function removes the first and last occurrences of `c` from the string `s` and returns the modified string. If the character `c` is not found within the string `s`, the function simply returns the original string `s`.**
