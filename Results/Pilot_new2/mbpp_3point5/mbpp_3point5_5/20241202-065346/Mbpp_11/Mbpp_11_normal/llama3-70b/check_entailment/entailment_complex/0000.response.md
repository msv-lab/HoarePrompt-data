Correctness: **False**

The program does not completely fulfill the problem description. While it correctly removes the first occurrence of the character `c` and the last occurrence of the character `c`, it does not remove the first and last occurrences simultaneously as required by the problem description.

For example, if the input string is "hellohworldh" and the character is 'h', the program will output "ellohworld" instead of "ello world". This is because the character 'h' at the index 6 is removed first, and then the character 'h' at the index 10 is removed, instead of removing both occurrences at the same time. 

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
