Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description. While the function `func_1` attempts to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character `c` in the string `s`, it does not handle the case where the first and last occurrences are the same character. For example, if the input string is "hello" and the character to remove is 'h', the output should be "ello" according to the problem description. However, the function would return the original string "hello" in this case, failing to remove both occurrences of 'h'. This inconsistency makes the code incorrect.
