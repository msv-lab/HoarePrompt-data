Correctness: **False**

While the program attempts to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string, it has a logical error that causes it to not always meet the problem description.

The issue lies in the line:
```python
return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

This line should actually be:
```python
return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1 + 1:]
```

The corrected version ensures that the last occurrence of the character is also excluded when creating the new string. Without this correction, the program will not remove the last occurrence of the character in some cases, leading to incorrect output. 

Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for and is not completely correct.
