Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a single character string. If the character `ch` is not found in string `s`, or if `ch` is found only once in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, the function returns a new string obtained by removing the characters at the positions of the first occurrence and last occurrence of `ch` in the original string `s`. The code also includes assertions that test the function with different inputs and expected outputs, which align with the problem description. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the correctness of the program is True.
