The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a single character string. 

Case_1: The program returns the original string `s`.

Case_2: The program returns a new string obtained by removing the characters at the positions of `first_index` and `last_index` from the original string `s`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and either return the original string `s` or a new string with characters removed at specific positions based on the inputs `first_index` and `last_index`.
