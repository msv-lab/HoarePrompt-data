Example Answer:
`first_index` is assigned the value of the first index of character `ch` in string `s` using the `find` method. If the character `ch` is not found in string `s`, then `first_index` will be assigned -1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a single character string, first_index is the index of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found in s**
