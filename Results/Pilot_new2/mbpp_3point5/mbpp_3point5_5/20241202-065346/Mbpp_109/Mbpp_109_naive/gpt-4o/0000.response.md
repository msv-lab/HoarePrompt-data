Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input. It then rotates the binary string the given number of times and converts it to an integer value. If the integer value is odd, it increments the count. The program then returns the final count of numbers with an odd value after rotating the binary string the specified number of times. 

The program has been verified to work correctly for the provided test cases and follows the problem description accurately. Additionally, since the logic is straightforward and there are no edge cases mentioned that could potentially break the program, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
