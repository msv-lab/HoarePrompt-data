Postcondition: ***binary_str is a string representing a binary number where the last digit is moved to the beginning, num_rotations is a non-negative integer greater than 0, count is 1 if integer_value is odd. If integer_value is odd, then binary_str is rotated to the right and num_rotations is incremented by 1.***
