The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a string representing a binary number, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. The function rotates the binary string `binary_str` by moving the last digit to the beginning for the specified number of rotations. After all iterations, it counts the number of times the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` is odd and returns that count.
