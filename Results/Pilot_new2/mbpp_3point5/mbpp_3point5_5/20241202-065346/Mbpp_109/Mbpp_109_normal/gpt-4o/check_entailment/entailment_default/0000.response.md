Correctness: **True**

The code for the function `func_1` seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function takes a binary string `binary_str` and the number of rotations `num_rotations`. It then rotates the binary string by moving the last digit to the beginning for the specified number of rotations. After all iterations, it counts the number of times the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` is odd and returns that count.

The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description. The logic of rotating the binary string and checking the odd value of the integer after rotation is correctly implemented. All the provided test cases also work as expected, confirming the correctness of the code.
