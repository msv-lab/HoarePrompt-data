Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided matches the problem description. The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It repeats the binary string `s` to match the length of `n`, then calculates the total number of '1's in the repeated string and returns the remainder of dividing that total by 2. The code is correctly implemented and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
