Correctness: True

Explanation: The program iterates through the input array and checks if the element matches the target element. If a match is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index position. If no match is found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program is correct as it correctly implements the requirements.
