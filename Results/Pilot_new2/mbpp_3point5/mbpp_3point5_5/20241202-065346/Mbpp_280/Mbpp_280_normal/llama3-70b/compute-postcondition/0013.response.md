Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`. It then iterates through the list to find the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is found, it returns True along with the index of the element in the list. If `elem` is not found, it returns False and -1. The function covers cases where `elem` is found at different indices in the list.**
