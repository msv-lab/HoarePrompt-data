Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, then returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The code iterates through the array using `enumerate` to access both the index and value of each element. If the value matches the input element, it returns True along with the index position. If the element is not found, it correctly returns False and -1. The provided examples also work correctly with the code. There are no cases identified where the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
