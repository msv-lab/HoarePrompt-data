Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array `arr` and an element, then iterates through the elements of the array to check if the specified element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1 as the index. This behavior aligns with the problem description, making the program correct.
