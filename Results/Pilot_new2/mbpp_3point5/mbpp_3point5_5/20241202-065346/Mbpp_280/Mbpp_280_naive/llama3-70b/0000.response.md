Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the element at that index. If the element matches the input element, it returns a tuple with a boolean `True` indicating that the element is in the array and the index of that element. If the element is not found after iterating through the entire array, it returns a tuple with a boolean `False` indicating that the element is not in the array and `-1` as the index. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
