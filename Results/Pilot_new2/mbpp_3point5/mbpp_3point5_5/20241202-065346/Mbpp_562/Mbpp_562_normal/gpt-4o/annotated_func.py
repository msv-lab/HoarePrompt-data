#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        if len(sublist) > max_length:
            max_length = len(sublist)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: max_length is the length of the longest sublist in list_of_lists
    return max_length
    #The program returns the length of the longest sublist in the list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist to find the length of the longest sublist in the list_of_lists and returns this length. The function accurately determines the length of the longest sublist within the provided list_of_lists.
