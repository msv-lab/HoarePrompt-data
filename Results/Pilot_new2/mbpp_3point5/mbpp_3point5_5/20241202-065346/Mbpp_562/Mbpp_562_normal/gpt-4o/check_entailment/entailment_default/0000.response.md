Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and iterates through each sublist to find the length of the longest sublist. It then returns this length. The provided test cases also confirm that the code is correctly identifying the length of the longest sublists in each example. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, and the output hints do not suggest any edge cases or scenarios where the code might fail to produce the correct result.
