Correctness: True

Explanation: The given function takes a list of sublists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. The implementation uses a generator expression to iterate over each sublist in the input list and then returns the maximum length of all the sublists. This logic correctly follows the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Hence, the program is considered correct.
