Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes two non-negative integer parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price`. It then checks if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price` using the equality operator `==` and returns `True` if they are equal, otherwise it returns `False`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of checking whether the given amount has no profit and no loss, as having the cost price equal to the selling price implies no profit or loss. So, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
