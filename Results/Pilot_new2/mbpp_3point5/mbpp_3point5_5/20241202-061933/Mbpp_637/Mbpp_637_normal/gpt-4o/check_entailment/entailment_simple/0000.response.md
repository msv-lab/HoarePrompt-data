Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to check whether the amount has no profit and no loss. Since having the cost price equal to the selling price indicates no profit and no loss, the program is correct and always follows the problem description.
