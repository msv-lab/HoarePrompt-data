Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`. The function then converts the tuple `tup` into a list and concatenates it with the input list `lst`. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description, which requires adding the elements of the tuple to the given list. The program always performs this operation correctly for every potential case.
