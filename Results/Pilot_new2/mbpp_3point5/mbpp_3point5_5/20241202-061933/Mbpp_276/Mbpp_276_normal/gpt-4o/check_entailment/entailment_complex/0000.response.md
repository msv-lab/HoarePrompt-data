Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, and returns the calculated volume. The annotations in the code confirm that the program does exactly what the problem description asks for. Since the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is true.
