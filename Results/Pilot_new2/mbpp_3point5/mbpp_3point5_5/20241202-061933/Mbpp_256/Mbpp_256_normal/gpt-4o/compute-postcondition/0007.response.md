According to the code, the loop can execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. Additionally, the loop body will execute for each value of `j` in the range `i * i` to `n` with a step size of `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is 2 and satisfies the condition `is_prime[i]`, `j` is `i * i`**
