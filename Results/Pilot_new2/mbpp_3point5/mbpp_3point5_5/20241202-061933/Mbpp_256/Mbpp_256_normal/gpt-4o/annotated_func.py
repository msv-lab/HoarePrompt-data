#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. n is greater than 2
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`. All non-prime numbers in the range of 2 to `n-1` have been marked as False in the `is_prime` list.
    return sum(is_prime)
    #The program returns the sum of all boolean values in the list `is_prime`, where False represents non-prime numbers and True represents prime numbers from 2 to `n-1`
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. For `n` greater than 2, the function generates a list `is_prime` where False represents non-prime numbers and True represents prime numbers from 2 to `n-1`. Then, the function returns the sum of all boolean values in the list `is_prime`. It does not handle the case where `n` is equal to 1, which can lead to incorrect results.
