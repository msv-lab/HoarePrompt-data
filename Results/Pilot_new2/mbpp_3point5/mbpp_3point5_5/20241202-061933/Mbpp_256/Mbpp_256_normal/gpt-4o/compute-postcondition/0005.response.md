According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 2 to the square root of `n`. Before the loop starts, `n` is already a non-negative integer greater than 2, which satisfies the loop condition. However, the `is_prime` list needs to be adjusted so that it has `True` values from index 2 to the square root of `n - 1`. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 2.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is 2**
