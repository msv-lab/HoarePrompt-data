According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `i*i`, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are False. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be incremented by `i` from `i*i` until it is less than `n`. So, in the next iteration, `j` should be set to `n`, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` should be set to False.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i*i`, `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are False, `j` is `n`**.
