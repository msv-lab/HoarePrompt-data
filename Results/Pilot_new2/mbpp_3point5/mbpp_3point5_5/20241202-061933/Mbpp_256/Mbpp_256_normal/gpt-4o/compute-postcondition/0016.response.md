According to the code, the loop can execute if `i * i < n` and `i` does not divide `j` evenly. The loop iterates over values of `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step size of `i`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `j` is `n^2`, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False, `i` should be less than `n`, `i` should be adjusted to 3, and `j` should be adjusted to 9.
