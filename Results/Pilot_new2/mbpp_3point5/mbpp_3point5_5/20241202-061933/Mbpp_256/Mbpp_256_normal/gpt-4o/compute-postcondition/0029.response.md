According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i * i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `i*i`, and `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are False except for `j=n` which is False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` to satisfy `n` being greater than or equal to `i*i`.
- The value of `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` should be updated to be False except for `j=n` which should remain False.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`, `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are False except for `j=n` which is now False**
