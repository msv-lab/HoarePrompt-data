Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 2. The loop iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). For each `i`, if `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any `i`, the function does not return anything.**
