I will now analyze the provided code based on the problem description and the output hints.

Initial Assessment:
The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and counts the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n`. The `is_prime` function is used to determine if a number is prime. The code does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2, which may lead to incorrect prime number count. Additionally, the function does not handle the scenario where `n` is equal to 2.

Now, I will check if the output hints agree with the code and if they provide any insights on potential cases where the code might not be correct.

Output hints Analysis:
The output hints for function 1 state that the function should calculate the number of prime numbers between 2 and `n` by iterating through numbers from 2 to `n-1` and checking for primality using the `is_prime` function. The hints mention that the code does not consider the case where `n` is less than 2 and does not handle the scenario where `n` is equal to 2.

Based on the initial assessment and the output hints, the code does not cover the case where `n` is less than 2, leading to an incorrect prime number count. Additionally, the code does not handle the scenario where `n` is equal to 2, resulting in a count of prime numbers being 0 when it should be 1.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2 and does not consider the scenario where `n` is equal to 2, leading to incorrect results in these cases.
