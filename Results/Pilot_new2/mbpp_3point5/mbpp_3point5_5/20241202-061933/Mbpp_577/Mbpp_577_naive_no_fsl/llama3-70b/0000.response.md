Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The program only handles specific cases (n < 4) and returns the wrong value (0) for all other cases. 

For example, for n = 5, the factorial is 120, and the last digit should be 0. However, the program does not return the correct last digit.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases and is incorrect.
