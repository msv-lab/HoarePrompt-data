Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only returns the last digit of the factorial if the input number is less than 5. However, the problem description asks for finding the last digit of factorial of a given number for all cases. 

For example, if we input 21, the factorial of 21 is 51090942171709440000, and the last digit should be 0. But the program returns 0 only if the input is less than 5, which is incorrect.
