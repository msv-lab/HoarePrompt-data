According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 4 inclusive, the `factorial` is the product of all numbers from 1 up to `n`, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be between 1 and 5 inclusive, the `factorial` should be updated to include the next number after `n`, and `i` should be updated to `n + 1` + 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, factorial is the product of all numbers from 1 up to n+1, i is equal to n + 1 + 1**
