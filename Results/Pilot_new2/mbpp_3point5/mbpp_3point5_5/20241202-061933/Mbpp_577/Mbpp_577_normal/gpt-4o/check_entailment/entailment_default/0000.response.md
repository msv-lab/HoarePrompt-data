Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The code only handles cases when the input number is less than 5, and calculates the factorial accordingly. However, the problem description states that the function should return 0 for any non-negative integer input, which is not implemented in the provided code. Additionally, the code does not cover the scenario when the input number is greater than 5, which is also a requirement according to the description. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
