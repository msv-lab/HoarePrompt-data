#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n >= 5) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 5 inclusive; factorial is the product of all numbers from 1 up to n multiplied by (n+1); i is equal to n + 1
        return factorial % 10
        #The program returns the last digit of the product of all numbers from 1 up to n multiplied by (n+1), where n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 5 inclusive
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. 
Case_1: If `n` is any non-negative integer, the function returns 0.
Case_2: If `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, the function calculates the product of all numbers from 1 up to `n`, multiplies it by `(n+1)`, and returns the last digit of this result. 
The functionality does not cover the case when `n` is greater than 5, and there is no specific handling for that scenario.
