Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` recursively flattens a nested list structure by checking if each item in the list is a list itself. If it is a list, it recursively calls the function on that sublist, otherwise, it appends the item to the `flat_list`. The program then asserts three test cases to check if the function correctly flattens the given nested lists, and based on the provided assertions, the program passes all the test cases and gives the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
