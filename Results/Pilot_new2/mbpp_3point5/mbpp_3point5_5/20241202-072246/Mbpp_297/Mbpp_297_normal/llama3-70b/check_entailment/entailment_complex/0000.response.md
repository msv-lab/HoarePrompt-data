Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements a recursive function `func_1` that takes a nested list structure as input and flattens it into a single list by replacing any nested lists with their elements. The function works as expected for all cases of nested lists and correctly returns a flat list containing all elements of the original nested list structure. The annotations provided also clearly explain the behavior of the function, matching the problem description. Thus, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
