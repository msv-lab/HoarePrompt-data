Postcondition: ***nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 2 elements, flat_list is updated based on the type of the first element in nested_list. If the second element in nested_list is a list, then flat_list is extended by the result of func_1 applied on element. If the second element in nested_list is not a list, then flat_list is updated with the second element in nested_list.***
