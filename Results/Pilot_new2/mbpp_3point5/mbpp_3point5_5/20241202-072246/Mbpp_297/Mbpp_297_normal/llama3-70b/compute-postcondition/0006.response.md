Postcondition: ***nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 1 element. If the first element is a list, flat_list is a list containing the elements returned by func_1(element), and element is a list. If the first element is not a list, flat_list is a list containing only the first element of nested_list, and element is the first element in nested_list.***
