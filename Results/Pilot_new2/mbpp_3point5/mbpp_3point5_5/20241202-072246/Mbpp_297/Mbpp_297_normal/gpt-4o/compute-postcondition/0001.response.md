According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 1 item, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, flat_list being empty does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to nested_list has at least 1 item and item is the first item in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists that must have at least 1 item, flat_list is an empty list, item is the first item in the nested_list**
