Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the function to flatten a given nested list structure. The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input, recursively flattens the nested list structure by applying `func_1` to each nested list within it, and returns a single flat list. The code handles nested lists containing integers or other nested lists, correctly flattening them to return the expected output. The output hints also align with the code behavior, confirming that the function works as described. Since the code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the examples provided, the correctness of the code is true.
