Postcondition: ***nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists that must have at least 1 item. If the item is a list, flat_list is a list containing the elements returned by func_1(item) and item is the first item in the nested_list. If the item is not a list, flat_list contains the first item from nested_list.***
