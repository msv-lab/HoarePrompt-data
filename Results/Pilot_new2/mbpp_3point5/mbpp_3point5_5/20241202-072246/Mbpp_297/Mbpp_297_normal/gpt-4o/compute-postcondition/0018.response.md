Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists. The function recursively flattens the nested list structure by applying `func_1` to each nested list within it. It returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements flattened with `func_1` applied. In cases where an item in the nested list is not a list, `flat_list` includes all items flattened, including those returned from `func_1`. The function effectively flattens nested lists and returns a single flat list.**
