Postcondition: ***nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists that must have at least 3 items. If the second item is a list, flat_list is a list containing the elements returned by func_1(second_item) and item is the third item in the nested_list. If the second item is not a list, flat_list contains the third item from nested_list with func_1 applied. Additionally, if the second item is not a list, the third item is added to flat_list after applying func_1. This condition holds true for both the if and else parts of the program fragment.***
