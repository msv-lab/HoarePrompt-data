You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists.**
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists. If any item is a list, flat_list is a list containing all the elements flattened with func_1 applied to each nested list. If any item is not a list, flat_list contains all items flattened, including those returned from func_1.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list which contains all elements flattened with func_1 applied to each nested list in the nested_list structure. If any item is not a list, flat_list contains all items flattened, including those returned from func_1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists. The function recursively flattens the nested list structure by applying `func_1` to each nested list within it. It returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements flattened with `func_1` applied. In cases where an item in the nested list is not a list, `flat_list` includes all items flattened, including those returned from `func_1`. The function effectively flattens nested lists and returns a single flat list.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
