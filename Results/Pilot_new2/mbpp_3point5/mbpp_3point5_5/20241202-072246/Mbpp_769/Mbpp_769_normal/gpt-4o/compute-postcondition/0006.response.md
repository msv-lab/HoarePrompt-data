The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists. The function returns a list containing the elements of the symmetric difference of `list1` and `list2`, sorted based on their indexes in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists, find their symmetric difference, and return a new list containing the elements sorted based on their indexes in the combined list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, returns a new list containing the elements of the symmetric difference of the input lists, sorted based on their indexes in the combined list.**
