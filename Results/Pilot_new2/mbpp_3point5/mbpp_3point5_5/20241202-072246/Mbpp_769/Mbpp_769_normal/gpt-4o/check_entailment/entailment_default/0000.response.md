Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. While the code correctly calculates the symmetric difference of the input lists and sorts the elements based on their indexes in the combined list of list1 and list2, there is an issue with how the sorting is done. The sorting is based on the indexes in the combined list of list1 and list2, which may not always be accurate, especially when duplicate elements are present in the input lists.

For example, if we consider the testcase `func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1])`, the expected output should be `[2, 3, 6, 7]` since the symmetric difference of the two lists is `[2, 3, 6, 7]`. However, the code will sort the elements based on their indexes in the combined list of list1 and list2, resulting in the output `[2, 3, 7, 6]`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases correctly and the correctness should be considered as **False**.
