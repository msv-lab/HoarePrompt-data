#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists.**
def func_1(list1, list2):

    set2 = set(list2)
    diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
    result_list = list(diff_elements)
    result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))
    return result_list
    #The program returns a list containing the elements of the symmetric difference of set1 and set2, sorted based on their indexes in the combined list of list1 and list2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, calculates the symmetric difference of the sets created from the input lists, creates a new list containing these elements, and sorts them based on their indexes in the combined list of list1 and list2.
