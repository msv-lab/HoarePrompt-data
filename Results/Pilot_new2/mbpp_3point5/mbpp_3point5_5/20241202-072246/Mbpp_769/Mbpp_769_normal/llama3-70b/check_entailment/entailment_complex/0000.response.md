Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list containing elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. This is exactly what the problem description asks for - getting the difference between two lists by performing the symmetric difference operation.

The use of set operations such as `set(list1) ^ set(list2)` effectively calculates the symmetric difference between the two lists, and then using `sorted()` to return the result in sorted order. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
