Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided matches the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and uses the symmetric difference operation to return a sorted list containing elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. The use of the `set` data structure helps in efficiently performing this operation. The code also handles cases where one or both lists are empty, as well as cases where both lists contain the same elements. The output hints also align with the code and confirm that the function is correctly implementing the desired functionality. Thus, the code is correct for all potential cases described in the problem.
