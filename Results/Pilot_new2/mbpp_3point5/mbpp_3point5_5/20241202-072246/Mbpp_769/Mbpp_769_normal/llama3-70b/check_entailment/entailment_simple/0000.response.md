Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input. It then uses set operations to find the symmetric difference between the two lists (elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both) and returns the sorted result.

This program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the difference between two lists and returns the sorted result, which is what the problem description asks for. Therefore, the program is correct.
