Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns the elements that are present in one list but not in the other. It achieves this by first converting both lists into sets, then using the symmetric difference operator `^` to find the elements that are unique to each set, and finally sorting the result to return a list. This implementation correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. There are no specific inputs or edge cases provided where this implementation would fail to produce the expected output.
