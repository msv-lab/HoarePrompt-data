Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly implement the given problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a new string where all spaces in `s` are replaced with '%20'. This matches the problem description accurately. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the code is working as expected by stating that the function replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20'. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
