Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `input_string`, and it returns the `input_string` with all spaces replaced by '%20'. The provided test cases also support the fact that the code is working as expected for the given problem description. The code replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20' using the `replace` function in Python, which aligns with the requirements of the problem. There are no edge cases identified where the code might fail to replace spaces with '%20'.
