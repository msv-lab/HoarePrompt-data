Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes an input string and uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces with '%20'. This meets the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a function that replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The program will work correctly for all potential cases as the `replace` method in Python replaces all occurrences of a substring in a string.
