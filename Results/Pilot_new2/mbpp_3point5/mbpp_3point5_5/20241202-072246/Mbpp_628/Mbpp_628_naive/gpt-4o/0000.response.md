Correctness: **True**

I have tested the given function `func_1` with multiple input strings and it correctly replaces all spaces with '%20'. The function uses the `replace()` method in Python which is specifically designed to replace all occurrences of a substring in a string. Since the function works as described for all the provided test cases, and there are no edge cases mentioned that could potentially fail, I believe the code is correct.
