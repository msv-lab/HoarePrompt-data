Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program is a simple one-liner that utilizes the `upper()` method in Python to convert a given string to uppercase. This method is a built-in function in Python that converts all characters in a string to uppercase. Since the program directly uses this built-in method, there are no edge cases or potential scenarios where it might not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
