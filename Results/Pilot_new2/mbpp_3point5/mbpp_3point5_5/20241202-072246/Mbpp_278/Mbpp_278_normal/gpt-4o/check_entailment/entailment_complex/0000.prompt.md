You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    count = 0
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            break
        
        count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` has at least 5 elements, `count` is the total number of elements in `tup`, `elem` is the fifth element in `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of elements in `tup`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns the total number of elements in the tuple. It iterates over the elements of the tuple until it encounters a tuple element, at which point it stops counting and returns the total count of elements encountered so far. However, there is a missing condition where the function should handle cases where there are no tuple elements in the tuple `tup` as it currently does not account for this scenario.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
