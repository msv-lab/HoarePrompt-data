Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and iterates through each element in the tuple. It checks if the element is a tuple, and if it is, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it increments the `count` variable to keep track of the number of elements that occur before the tuple element.

The program correctly finds the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple, as specified in the problem description. The function returns the count of elements before the tuple element, which aligns with the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
