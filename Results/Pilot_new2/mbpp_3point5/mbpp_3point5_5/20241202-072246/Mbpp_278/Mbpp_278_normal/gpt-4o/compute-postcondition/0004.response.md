Postcondition: ***`tup` has at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, then the program state will encounter a tuple as the first element in `tup`, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
