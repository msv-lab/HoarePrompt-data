According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `tup` is a tuple, so it must contain at least 1 element for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `tup` is a tuple that must have at least 1 element.
State: **`tup` is a tuple that must have at least 1 element**
