Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number as input and converts it to polar coordinates using the `cmath.polar` function. The program then asserts that the output of `func_1` for various inputs matches the expected polar coordinates. Since the program is directly using the `cmath.polar` function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates and the provided test cases are straightforward, there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
