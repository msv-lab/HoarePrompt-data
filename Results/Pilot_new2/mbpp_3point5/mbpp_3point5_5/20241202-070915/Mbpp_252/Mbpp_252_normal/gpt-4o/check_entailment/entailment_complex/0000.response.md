Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `num` as input and uses the `cmath` module to return its polar coordinates (magnitude, phase angle). This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asked for a Python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. The function implementation meets the requirements and always returns the desired output, making it correct.
