Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns its absolute value and phase, which aligns with the problem description of converting complex numbers to polar coordinates. The use of `abs` function to calculate the absolute value and `cmath.phase` to calculate the phase of the complex number is appropriate for this conversion. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
