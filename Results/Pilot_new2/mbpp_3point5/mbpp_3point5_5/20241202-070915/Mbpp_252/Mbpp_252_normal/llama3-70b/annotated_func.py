#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a complex number.**
def func_1(c):
    return abs(c), cmath.phase(c)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the complex number 'c' and the phase of the complex number 'c'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a complex number c and returns its absolute value and phase.
