Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers as input and returns the maximum of the two numbers using a ternary operator. The provided test cases cover both positive and negative numbers and the program correctly returns the maximum of the two numbers in each case. Since the program meets the requirements of finding the maximum of two numbers for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
