Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and then returns the number of times `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`. The code directly aligns with the problem description and the output hints, which both state that the function should count the occurrences of the element in the tuple, and the code indeed accomplishes this task. Additionally, there are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where the code would behave incorrectly.
