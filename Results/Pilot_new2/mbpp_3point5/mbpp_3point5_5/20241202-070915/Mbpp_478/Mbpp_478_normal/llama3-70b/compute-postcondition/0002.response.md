Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a string parameter s and returns a new string that consists of only the uppercase letters present in the original string s. **

Note: The code does exactly what the annotations describe. It filters out and concatenates all the uppercase characters from the input string s to form the output string. The function does not handle any edge cases such as an empty string or special characters, as it focuses solely on extracting uppercase letters.
