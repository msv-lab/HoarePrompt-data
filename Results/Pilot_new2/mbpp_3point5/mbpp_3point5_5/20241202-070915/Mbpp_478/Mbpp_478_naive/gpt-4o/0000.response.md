Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not remove lowercase substrings from the given string as the problem description requires. Instead, it only returns the uppercase characters from the input string. For example, if we input 'PYTHon' according to the problem description the output should be 'PYTH' but the program returns 'PYTH'. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
