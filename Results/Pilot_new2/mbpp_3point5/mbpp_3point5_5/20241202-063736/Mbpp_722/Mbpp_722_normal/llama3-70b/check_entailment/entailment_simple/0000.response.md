Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the annotated code correctly filters out students whose height and weight are above the given minimum values. It iterates through the student_data dictionary, checking each student's height and weight against the minimum values provided. It then creates a new dictionary containing only the students who meet the criteria.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the program is correct as it filters out students based on their height and weight being above the minimum values.
