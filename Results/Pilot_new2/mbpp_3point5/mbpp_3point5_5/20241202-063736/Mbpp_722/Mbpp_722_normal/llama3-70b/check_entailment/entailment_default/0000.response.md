Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. It filters the student data based on the condition that both the height and weight of the students are greater than or equal to `min_height` and `min_weight` respectively. The output hints also support this by confirming that the function returns a dictionary containing only the student names and corresponding tuples of height and weight that meet the specified criteria. Additionally, it covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
