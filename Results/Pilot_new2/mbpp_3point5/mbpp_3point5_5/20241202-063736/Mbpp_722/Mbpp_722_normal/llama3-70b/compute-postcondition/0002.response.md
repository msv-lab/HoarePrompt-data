Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a dictionary `student_data`, along with `min_height` and `min_weight` floats. It then filters the student data based on the condition that both the height and weight of the students are greater than or equal to `min_height` and `min_weight` respectively. The function returns a dictionary containing only the student names and corresponding tuples of height and weight that meet the specified criteria. **

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality: 
- The function does not handle cases where `student_data` is empty or when `min_height` or `min_weight` are negative values. 
- If there are students who have height or weight equal to `min_height` or `min_weight`, it is unclear if they should be included in the filtered dictionary.
