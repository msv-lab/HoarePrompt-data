The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings (student names) and values are tuples of two floats (student_height, student_weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. After executing the function body, the program returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and their corresponding height and weight tuples as values, only including students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` with student names as keys and height, weight tuples as values, along with minimum height `min_height` and minimum weight `min_weight`. It returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and their corresponding height and weight tuples as values, only including students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.**
