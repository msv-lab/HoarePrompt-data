The function func_1 accepts a dictionary `student_dict` with student names as keys and height, weight tuples as values, along with minimum height `min_height` and minimum weight `min_weight`. It then returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and their corresponding height and weight tuples as values, only including students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.
