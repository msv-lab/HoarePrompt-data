You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The input is given as - a dictionary with a student name as a key and a tuple of float (student_height, student_weight) as a value, - minimal height, - minimal weight. Write a function to filter students that have height and weight above the minimum.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: student_dict is a dictionary where keys are strings (student names) and values are tuples of two floats (student_height, student_weight). min_height and min_weight are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively.**
def func_1(student_dict, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in student_dict.
    items() if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
    #The program returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and their corresponding height and weight tuples as values, only including students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
