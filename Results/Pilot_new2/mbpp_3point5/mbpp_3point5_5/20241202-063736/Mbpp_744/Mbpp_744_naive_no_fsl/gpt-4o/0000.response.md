Correctness: True

Explanation: The program defines a function that iterates over the input tuple and checks if any item is equal to None. If it finds a None value, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False. The provided test cases cover both scenarios where there is a None value in the tuple and where there isn't, and the program produces the expected output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
