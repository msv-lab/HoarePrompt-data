Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses the `any` function to check if there is any element in the tuple that is `None`. If there is any `None` element present, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to check if the given tuple has any `None` value or not. The program always follows the problem description and returns the expected output for all potential cases.
