Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that accepts a tuple `tup` and uses the `any` function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is `None`. The code aligns with the problem description, where it is stated that the function should return True if there is any element in the tuple that is `None`, and False otherwise. The code is concise, readable, and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Additionally, there are no edge cases identified where the code might fail to produce the expected output. Thus, the code is considered correct.
