Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It takes a tuple as input and checks if any of the items in the tuple are None. If it finds a None value, it returns True, indicating that the tuple has a None value. If no None values are found, it returns False. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, making the program correct.
