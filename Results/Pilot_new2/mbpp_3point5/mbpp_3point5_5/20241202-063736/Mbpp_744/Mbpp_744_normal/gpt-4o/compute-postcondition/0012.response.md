The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program will return True in multiple cases. In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, the program will return True. However, in Case 4, the program will return False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return True in multiple cases while returning False in one specific case. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, returns True in multiple cases and False in one specific case.**
