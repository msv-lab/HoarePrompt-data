According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup` tuple. If the tuple has at least 2 items, the loop will execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least 1 item and the item is not None. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `tup` tuple must have at least 2 items.
State: **`tup` is a tuple that must have at least 2 items. The items in the tuple are not None**
