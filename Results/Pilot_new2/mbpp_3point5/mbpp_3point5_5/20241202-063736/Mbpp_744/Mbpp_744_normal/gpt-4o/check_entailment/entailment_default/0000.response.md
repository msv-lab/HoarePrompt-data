Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` correctly follows the problem description. The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns True only if there is at least one `None` value in the tuple; otherwise, it returns False. The code iterates through each item in the tuple and checks if the item is `None`, returning True as soon as it finds a `None` value. If no `None` value is found in the tuple, the function returns False. The code logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, and there are no edge cases identified where the code does not behave as expected.
