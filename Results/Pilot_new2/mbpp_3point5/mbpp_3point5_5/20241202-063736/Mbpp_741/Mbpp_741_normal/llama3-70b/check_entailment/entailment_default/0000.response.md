Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, it returns False. The code achieves this by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1, which would indicate that all characters are the same. The logic is simple and straightforward, and there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that are not covered by the code. The output hints also agree with the code by stating that the function returns True if all characters in the string are the same, providing additional confirmation of correctness.
