Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function correctly checks whether all the characters in the input string are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach works correctly for all cases, as if all characters are the same in the string, the set will have only one element, resulting in the function returning True. If there are different characters present, the set will have multiple elements, leading to the function returning False.
