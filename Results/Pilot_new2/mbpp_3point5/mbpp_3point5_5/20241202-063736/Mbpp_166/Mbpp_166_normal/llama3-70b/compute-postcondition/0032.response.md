Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than `i + 2`, `count` is the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number. If the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, where `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is equal to the new value of `i` plus 1, `count` is incremented by 1.***
