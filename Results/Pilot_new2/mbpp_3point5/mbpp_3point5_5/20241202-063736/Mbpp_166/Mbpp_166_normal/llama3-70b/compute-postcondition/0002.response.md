According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. Since `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, it ensures that the loop can execute. The loop will execute as long as the range `i + 1` to `len(nums)` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `j` should be equal to `i + 1` and `i` should be less than the length of `nums`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is 0, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`**
