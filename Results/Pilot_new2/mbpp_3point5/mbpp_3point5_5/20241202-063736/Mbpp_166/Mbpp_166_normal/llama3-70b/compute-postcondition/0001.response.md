According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `nums` has at least one integer. Since the loop iterates over the length of the list `nums`, it implies that the list must have a length greater than 0. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
