The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. The program calculates the total number of pairs in the `nums` list where the XOR operation between the pair of numbers results in an even number. The function then returns this total count of such pairs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers nums and returns the total number of pairs where the XOR operation between the pair of numbers results in an even number.**
