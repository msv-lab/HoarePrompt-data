Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in the list that XOR to an even number. It achieves this by iterating through all valid pairs of indices in the list, calculating the XOR of the pair of numbers, and checking if the result is even. The count is updated accordingly and returned at the end.

The program follows the problem description accurately by specifically counting the number of pairs that XOR to an even number, meeting all the requirements specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
