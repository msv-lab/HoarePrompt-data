Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. The code achieves this by using a list comprehension to check if all elements at index `i` are less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1` for all `i` in the range `[0, len(lst) - 1)`. This logic correctly determines if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the function returns True only if all elements in the list are in order. Since there are no edge cases or potential situations mentioned in the description or the output hints where the code might fail, it can be considered correct.
