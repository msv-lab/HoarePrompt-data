The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. The function iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If any element is greater than the following element, the function returns False. If all elements maintain non-decreasing order, the function returns True. The function handles the case where `lst` has at least 2 elements and correctly determines the order of elements in the list.
