Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it goes through the entire list without finding any such pair, it returns True, indicating that the list is sorted. This behavior aligns with the problem description of checking whether a list is sorted or not.
