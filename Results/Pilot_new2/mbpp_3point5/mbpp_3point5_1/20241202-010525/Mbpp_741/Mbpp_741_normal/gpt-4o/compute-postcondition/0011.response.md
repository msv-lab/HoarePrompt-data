According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will continue executing until it has iterated through all characters in the string.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is equal to the next character in `s`. If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next `char` needs to be considered in the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the character after the current `char` in the string `s`.**
