Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. After the loop finishes executing, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number. `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `j` is equal to the length of `nums` - 1.**
