Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function `func_1` which counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. The program iterates through all possible pairs of elements in the input list `nums`, calculates the XOR operation between each pair, and increments the count if the result is an even number. The final count is returned as the output.

Since the program follows the problem description accurately and counts the number of pairs of integers that XOR to an even number, it can be deemed correct.
