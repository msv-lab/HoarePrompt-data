Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `j` is greater than `i + 1, `count` is incremented by 1**
