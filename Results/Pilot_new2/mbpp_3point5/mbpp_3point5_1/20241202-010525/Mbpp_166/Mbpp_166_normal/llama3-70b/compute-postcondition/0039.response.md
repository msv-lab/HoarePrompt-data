The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. The function returns the total number of pairs of elements `(i, j)` in `nums` such that the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, where `i` is equal to the length of `nums` and `j` is equal to the length of `nums` - 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return the total number of pairs of elements that satisfy the specified condition for the XOR operation.
