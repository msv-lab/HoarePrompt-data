The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. The function calculates the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs based on the integers in the list `lst`. 

- even_pairs: The count of even numbers in the list `lst` multiplied by the count of even numbers in `lst` minus 1, divided by 2.
- odd_pairs: The count of odd numbers in the list `lst` multiplied by the count of odd numbers in `lst` minus 1, divided by 2.

The program then returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst`, calculate the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs based on the integers in the list, and return the total sum. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers lst, calculates the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs based on the integers in the list, and returns the total sum.**
