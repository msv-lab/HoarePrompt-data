You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.**
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
    #The program returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs, where even_pairs is equal to the count of even numbers in `lst` multiplied by count of even numbers in `lst` minus 1 divided by 2, and odd_pairs is equal to the count of odd numbers in `lst` multiplied by count of odd numbers in `lst` minus 1 divided by 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `lst`, calculates the count of even and odd numbers in the list, then computes the sum of pairs of even and odd numbers. The function returns the total sum of these pairs. However, there is a potential issue with this code as it only considers pairs of even and odd numbers, excluding pairs of either even or odd numbers. This missing functionality should be noted for complete accuracy.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
