Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses the `any` function to check if there is any element in the tuple that is `None`. If there is any `None` element in the tuple, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. Additionally, it mentions that if the tuple is empty, the function will return `False`.

This program directly aligns with the problem description, as it checks for the presence of `None` values in the tuple as required. It covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and returns the correct output.
