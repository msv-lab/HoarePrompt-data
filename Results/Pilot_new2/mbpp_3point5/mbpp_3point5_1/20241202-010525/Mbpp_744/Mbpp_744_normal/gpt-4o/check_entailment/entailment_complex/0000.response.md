Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem description. The function iterates through the items in the tuple and returns True if it encounters a `None` value, otherwise it returns False. The annotations clearly state the behavior of the function before and after the loop, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Hence, the program is correct.
