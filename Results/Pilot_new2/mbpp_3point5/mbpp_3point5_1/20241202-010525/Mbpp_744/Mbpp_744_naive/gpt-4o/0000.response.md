Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly iterates through the tuple and checks if any element is `None`. If it finds a `None` value, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The provided test cases also cover scenarios where the tuple has `None` values and where it does not have any `None` value. In both cases, the program behaves as expected.
