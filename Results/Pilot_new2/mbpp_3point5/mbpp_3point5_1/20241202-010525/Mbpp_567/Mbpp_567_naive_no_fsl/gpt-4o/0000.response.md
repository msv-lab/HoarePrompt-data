Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where the list is not sorted in ascending order. For example, the input `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` should return `False` according to the problem description, as it is not sorted. However, the program incorrectly returns `True`.
