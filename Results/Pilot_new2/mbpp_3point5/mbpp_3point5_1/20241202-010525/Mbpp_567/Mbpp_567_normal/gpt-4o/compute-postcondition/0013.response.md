Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a list lst of comparable elements. It iterates through the list and returns False if it encounters an element greater than the next element. Otherwise, it returns True. **

The function does not return False in all cases as mentioned in the annotations above, as it only returns False when an element is greater than the next element. This means that the case where the list is empty or has only one element is not explicitly handled in the annotations. Therefore, one potential edge case missing from the summary is when the list is empty or has only one element.
