The function func_1 accepts a dictionary named student_dict with student names as keys and tuples of height and weight as values, along with minimum height and minimum weight values. It then filters the student_dict based on the condition that only students with height greater than or equal to min_height and weight greater than or equal to min_weight are included in the returned dictionary.
