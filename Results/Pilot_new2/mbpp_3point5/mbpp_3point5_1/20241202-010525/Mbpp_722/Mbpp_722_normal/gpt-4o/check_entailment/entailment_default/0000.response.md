Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_dict` with student names as keys and tuples of height and weight as values, along with minimum height and minimum weight values as input. The function filters the `student_dict` based on the condition that only students with height greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight greater than or equal to `min_weight` are included in the returned dictionary.

The code correctly implements the described functionality. It iterates over each item in the `student_dict` using dictionary unpacking `(name, (height, weight))` and includes the student in the result dictionary only if their height and weight meet the specified minimum criteria.

Furthermore, the provided test cases cover different scenarios such as:
1. Filtering only one student with height and weight above the minimum values.
2. Filtering multiple students with height and weight above the minimum values.
3. Filtering all students when the minimum height and weight are below all student values.

Therefore, based on the code logic and the provided examples, the code seems to be correct.
