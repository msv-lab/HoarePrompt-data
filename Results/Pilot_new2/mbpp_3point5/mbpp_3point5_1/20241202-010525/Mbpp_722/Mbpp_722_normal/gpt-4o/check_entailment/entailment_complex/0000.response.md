Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_dict`, a `min_height`, and a `min_weight`. The function then filters the `student_dict` based on the condition that only students with height greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight greater than or equal to `min_weight` are included in the returned dictionary. This aligns with the problem description which requires filtering students based on their height and weight being above the minimum values. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
