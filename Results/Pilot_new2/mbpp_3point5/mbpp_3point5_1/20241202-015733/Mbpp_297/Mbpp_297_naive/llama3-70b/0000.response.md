Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function recursively flattens a nested list structure by iterating through each element in the input list. If the element is a list, it recursively calls the function on that sublist until all nested levels are flattened. When the function encounters a non-list element, it appends that element to the flat list. This logic correctly follows the problem description for flattening a nested list structure. Additionally, the function does not have any specific edge cases or conditions where it may fail to flatten the nested list properly. Hence, the program is correct.
