Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements. If the next element in `nested_list` is a list, then `flat_list` is updated by extending the result of `func_1(element)`. If the next element in `nested_list` is not a list, then `flat_list` has been updated to include the new `element`.***
