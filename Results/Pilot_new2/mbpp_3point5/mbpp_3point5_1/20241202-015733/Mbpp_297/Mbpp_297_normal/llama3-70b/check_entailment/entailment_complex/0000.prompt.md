You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists.**
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for element in nested_list:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(element))
        else:
            flat_list.append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list with an unknown number of elements, `flat_list` contains a flattened version of `nested_list` after all elements have been processed by the loop.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns a flattened version of `nested_list` after all elements have been processed by the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain nested lists. It recursively flattens the nested_list by iterating through each element and appending non-list elements to a flat_list. The function returns the flattened version of nested_list after processing all elements in the list with a loop.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
