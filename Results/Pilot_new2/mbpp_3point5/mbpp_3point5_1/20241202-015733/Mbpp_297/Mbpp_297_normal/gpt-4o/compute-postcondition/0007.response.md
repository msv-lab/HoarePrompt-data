According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element. If item is a list, flat_list will contain the elements returned by func_1(item) and item is the first element in the nested_list. If item is not a list, flat_list will contain the first element from nested_list and item is still the first element in the nested_list.

So for the loop to be executed one more time, nested_list must have at least 2 elements, and item will be the second element in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 2 elements. If item is a list, flat_list will contain the elements returned by func_1(item) and item is the second element in the nested_list. If item is not a list, flat_list will contain the second element from nested_list and item is still the second element in the nested_list.**
