Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. This aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to convert a given string to uppercase. The program always converts the input string to uppercase for any provided string.
