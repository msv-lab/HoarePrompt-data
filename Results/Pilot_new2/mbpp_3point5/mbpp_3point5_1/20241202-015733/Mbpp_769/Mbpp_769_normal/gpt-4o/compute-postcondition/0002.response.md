Example Answer:
`diff_elements` is assigned the set of elements that are in set1 or set2 but not in both. The previous values of list1, list2, set1, and set2 are not affected. 
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists; set1 is a set created from list1; set2 is a set created from list2; diff_elements is the set of elements that are in set1 or set2 but not in both**
