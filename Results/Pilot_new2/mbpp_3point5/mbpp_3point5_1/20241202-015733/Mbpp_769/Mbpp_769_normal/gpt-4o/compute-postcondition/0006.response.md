The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists. The program returns a list containing the elements of `diff_elements` sorted based on their index in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists, concatenate them, find the unique elements, sort them based on their index in the concatenated list, and return the sorted list.  
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, concatenates them, finds unique elements, sorts them based on their index in the concatenated list, and returns the sorted list.**
