Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. The function returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. The code achieves this by first converting both lists to sets to eliminate duplicates, then using the symmetric difference operator `^` to find unique elements in each list, and finally converting the result back to a sorted list. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, thus supporting the correctness of the code. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be any edge cases or missing logic that the code is not handling based on the given problem description.
