#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return sorted(list(set(list1) ^ set(list2)))
    #The program returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. The function returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. The code does exactly what the annotations describe without any missing functionality or edge cases.
