Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It uses the set symmetric difference operator (^) to get the unique elements that are present in either list but not in both. It then sorts the result before returning it. This approach ensures that the program returns the difference between the two lists as required. The program will work correctly for all cases where the goal is to find the difference between two lists.
