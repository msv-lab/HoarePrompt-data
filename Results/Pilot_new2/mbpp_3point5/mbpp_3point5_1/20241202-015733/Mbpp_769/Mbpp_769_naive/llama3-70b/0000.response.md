Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly returns the difference between two lists by first converting each list to a set to get unique elements, then using the '^' operator to find the symmetric difference between the two sets, and finally sorting the result. This approach covers all potential cases and the function works as described in the problem description.
