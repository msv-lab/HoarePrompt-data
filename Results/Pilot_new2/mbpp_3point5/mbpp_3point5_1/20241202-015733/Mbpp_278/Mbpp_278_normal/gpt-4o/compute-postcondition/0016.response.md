The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. The function iterates through the elements of the tuple `tup` and returns the number of elements in `tup` before the first occurrence of a tuple. If a tuple is encountered during the iteration, the loop breaks. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the number of elements before the first occurrence of a tuple.
