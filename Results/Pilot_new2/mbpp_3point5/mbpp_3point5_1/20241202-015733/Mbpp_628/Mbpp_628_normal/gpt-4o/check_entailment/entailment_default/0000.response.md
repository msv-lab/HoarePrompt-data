Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes an input_string as a parameter and replaces all spaces in the input_string with '%20' using the `replace()` method. The function is then tested with multiple test cases, and all the test cases pass successfully. 

The problem description states that the function should replace all spaces in the given string with '%20', which is exactly what the code does. The output hints also agree with the code by confirming that the function `func_1` replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20'. 

Therefore, based on the code logic, the problem description, and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct and meets the requirements specified.
