The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` greater than or equal to 0 and returns different values based on the value of `n` as follows:
- If `n` is less than 2, the function returns the value of `n`.
- If `n` is either 2 or 3, the function returns the value of `n`.
- If `n` is 4, the function returns 4.
- For any other value of `n`, the function returns 0.
Therefore, the functionality of the function accurately reflects the code logic and covers all potential cases.
