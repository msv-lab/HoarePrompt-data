According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `factorial` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `factorial` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
