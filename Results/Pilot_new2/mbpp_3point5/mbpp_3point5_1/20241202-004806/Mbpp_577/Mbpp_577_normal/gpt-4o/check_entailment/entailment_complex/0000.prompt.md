You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n >= 5) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer less than 5, `factorial` is the factorial of `n`
        return factorial % 10
        #The program returns the last digit of the factorial of 'n'. 'n' is a non-negative integer less than 5 and 'factorial' is the factorial of 'n'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. 
If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. 
If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to return 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, and the last digit of the factorial of `n` if `n` is less than 5.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
