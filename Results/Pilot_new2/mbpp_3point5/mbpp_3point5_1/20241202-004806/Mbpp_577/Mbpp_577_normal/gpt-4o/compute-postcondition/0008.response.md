According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `factorial` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `factorial` is multiplied by `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`, and `n` should be greater than or equal to `i + 1`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `factorial` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `factorial` is multiplied by `i + 1`**
