Correctness: **False**

In the given program `func_1`, the logic to find the last digit of the factorial of a given number is incorrect. The program always returns 0 if the input number is greater than or equal to 5. This is not correct as the last digit of the factorial of a number can vary based on the number itself.

For example:
- `func_1(4)` should return 4, as the last digit of the factorial of 4 is 4.
- `func_1(21)` should not return 0, as the last digit of the factorial of 21 is not 0.
- `func_1(30)` should not return 0, as the last digit of the factorial of 30 is not 0.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the Correctness **False**.
