Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, then returns the concatenation of the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl` converted into a list. The function implementation is straightforward and aligns with the problem description. The code correctly adds the given tuple to the given list for all test cases provided. The output hints do not suggest any edge cases where the code might fail to meet the problem description. Therefore, based on the code and problem description alignment, the correctness of the code is determined to be True.
