Correctness: **True**

The annotated program accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. It clearly states that the function concatenates the given list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tup` after converting them into a list. The code itself also implements this functionality correctly by using the `list()` function to convert the tuple `tup` into a list and then concatenating it with the list `lst`. This meets the requirements of the problem description, making the program correct.
