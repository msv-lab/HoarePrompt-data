Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input parameters. It then concatenates the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tup` converted into a list using the `list()` function. This aligns with the problem description of adding the given tuple to the given list. Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
