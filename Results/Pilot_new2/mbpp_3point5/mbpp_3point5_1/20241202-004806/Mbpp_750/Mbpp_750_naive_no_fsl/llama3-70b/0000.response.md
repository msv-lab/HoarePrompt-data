Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a list and a tuple as input and returns a new list that combines the elements of the original list and the elements of the tuple. The program correctly converts the tuple to a list using the `list()` function and then appends it to the original list. This logic will work for all possible cases and there are no edge cases that would cause the program to behave differently from the problem description.
