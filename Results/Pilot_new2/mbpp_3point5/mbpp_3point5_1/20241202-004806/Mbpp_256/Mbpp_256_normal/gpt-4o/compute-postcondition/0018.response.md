According to the code, the loop can execute again if j is less than n. At the end of the last iteration, i is 3, j starts at 9 and goes up to n with step size 3, is_prime[j] is False for each j that is a multiple of 3 in the range 9 to n. 

To execute the loop one more time, j needs to be updated to the next value in the range. Since the step size is 3, the next value of j should be the current value of j plus 3. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 3, `j` should be updated to its current value plus 3**
