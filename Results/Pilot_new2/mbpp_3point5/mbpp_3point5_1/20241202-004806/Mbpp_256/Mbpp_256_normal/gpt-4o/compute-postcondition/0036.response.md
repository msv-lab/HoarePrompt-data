Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. For `n` greater than 2, the function generates a list `is_prime` where each element is True if the index is a prime number, and False otherwise. It then returns the sum of the elements in the `is_prime` list. However, the code does not handle the case when `n` is 1 or 2, where the function should return 0 according to the comments, but `is_prime` is not being correctly calculated. **
