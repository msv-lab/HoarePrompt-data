Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 2. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then after entering the if condition, the current value of `i` is 2 and `is_prime[i]` is True.***
