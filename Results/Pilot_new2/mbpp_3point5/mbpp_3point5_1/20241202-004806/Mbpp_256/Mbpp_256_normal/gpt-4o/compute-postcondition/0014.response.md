Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2. `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False. `i` is 2. At the end of the loop, for all `i` in the range (2, sqrt(n)), if `is_prime[i]` is still True, then `i` is a prime number and all multiples of `i` up to `n` in `is_prime` are marked as False.***
