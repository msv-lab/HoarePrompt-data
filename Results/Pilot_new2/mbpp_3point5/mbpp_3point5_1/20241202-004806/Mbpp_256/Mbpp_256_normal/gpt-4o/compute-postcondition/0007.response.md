According to the code, the loop can execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, the value of `i` is 2 which is less than 3 (since `n` is larger than 2). So, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `is_prime[i]` is True which means that `i` is a prime number. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 2 and a prime number, `j` is 4**
