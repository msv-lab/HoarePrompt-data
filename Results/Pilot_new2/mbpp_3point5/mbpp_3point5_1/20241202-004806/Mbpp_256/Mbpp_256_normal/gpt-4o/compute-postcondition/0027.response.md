According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of `(i * i, n, i)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, so `j` must be within the range of `(16, n, 4)` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `i` increments by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be 5. Therefore, to adjust the states for the next iteration:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 16, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 5, `is_prime[j]` is False**
