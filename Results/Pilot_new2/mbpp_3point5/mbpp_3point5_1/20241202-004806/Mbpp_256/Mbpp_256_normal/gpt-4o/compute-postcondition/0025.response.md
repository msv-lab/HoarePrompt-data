According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will execute if `i * i < n`. Before the loop starts, `i` is 4, which means `j` will start at 16. Additionally, since `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, it means the list has at least 2 elements. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `i` is 4, `n` is such that `i * i < n`, and `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 16, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 4**
