According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are False, and `i` is 3. After the execution of the if statement, the loop has completed execution and `is_prime[j]` is False for each j that is a multiple of i in the range i * i to n. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1 and update the conditions accordingly. Since the loop starts from 2, the next `i` value should be 4. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 4**
