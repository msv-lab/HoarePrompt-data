According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` is within the range `(i * i, n, i)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is updated to its current value plus 3, and `is_prime[j]` is False. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the value of `j` to be within the range `(i * i, n, i)` for the next iteration. Since `i` is 3, we need to find the next value of `j` that satisfies this condition. The next value of `j` can be calculated by adding 3 to the current value of `j` as specified in the loop statement.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 3, `j` is updated to its current value plus 3, and `is_prime[j]` is False**
