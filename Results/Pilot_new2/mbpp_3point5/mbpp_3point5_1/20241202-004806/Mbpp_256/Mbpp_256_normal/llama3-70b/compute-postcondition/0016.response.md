Functionality: **The `is_prime` function accepts a non-negative integer `num` as a parameter. It returns False if `num` is less than 2. Otherwise, it iterates through a range to check if `num` is divisible by any number in that range. If `num` is divisible by any number, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any number in the range, the function returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number.**
