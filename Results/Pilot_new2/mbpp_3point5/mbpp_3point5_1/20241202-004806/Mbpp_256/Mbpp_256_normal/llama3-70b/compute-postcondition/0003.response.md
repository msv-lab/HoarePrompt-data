According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `num` is at least 2 to ensure the range starts at 2, and the value of `num` should be such that the square root of `num` is an integer. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and the loop variable `i` starts at 2.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, square root of `num` is an integer**
