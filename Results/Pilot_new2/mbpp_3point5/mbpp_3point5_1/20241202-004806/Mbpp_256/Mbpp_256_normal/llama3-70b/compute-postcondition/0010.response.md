According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, the square root of `num` is an integer, and `num` is not divisible by 2. Since the loop will execute for the next iteration, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4, the square root of `num` is an integer, and `num` is not divisible by 2**
