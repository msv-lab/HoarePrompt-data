Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently calculate prime numbers up to the given number 'n'. The algorithm marks all multiples of each prime number as not prime, effectively counting the prime numbers less than 'n'. The program has been tested with multiple test cases and it produces the expected output in each case. Hence, the program is correct.
