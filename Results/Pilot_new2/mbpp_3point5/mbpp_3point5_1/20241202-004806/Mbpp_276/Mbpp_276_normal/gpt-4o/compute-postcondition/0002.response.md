The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the program calculates the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius * height` and returns the resulting volume. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-negative numbers, calculate the volume using the given formula, and return the calculated volume.
Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative numbers, calculates the volume using the formula math.pi * radius * height, and returns the calculated volume.**
