Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. It returns `True` only when the cost price is equal to the selling price and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases cover all possible scenarios where the cost price is not equal to the selling price, and the function returns the expected results for each case. Hence, the program is correct.
