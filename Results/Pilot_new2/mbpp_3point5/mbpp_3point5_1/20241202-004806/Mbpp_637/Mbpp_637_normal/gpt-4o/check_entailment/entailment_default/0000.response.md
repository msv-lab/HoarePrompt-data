Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct as it matches the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, representing the cost price and selling price of an item. It correctly returns True if the cost price is equal to the selling price, otherwise it returns False. The provided assertions also seem to be testing the code against valid cases as per the problem description.
