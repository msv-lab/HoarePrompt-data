Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in an array and an element, then iterates over the array using `enumerate` to check if the element is present in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with boolean value True and the index position where the element is found. If the element is not found in the array, it returns a tuple with boolean value False and index position -1. The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases correctly.
