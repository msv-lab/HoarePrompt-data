Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in an array `arr` and an element `elem`. It then iterates over the array using enumerate to track the index of the element being iterated. If the element `elem` is found in the array, it returns a tuple containing True (indicating the element is found) and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple containing False (indicating the element is not found) and -1 as the index.

This implementation follows the problem description accurately as it returns a tuple with a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element as required. Thus, the program is correct.
