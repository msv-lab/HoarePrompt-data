Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`, then it iterates over the list to find if any element matches `elem`. If a match is found, it returns True along with the index `i` of the first occurrence of `elem`. If no match is found, it returns False and -1. The function covers the cases where `elem` is found at different indexes in the list.**
