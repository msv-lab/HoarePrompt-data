Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in an array and an element as input. It then iterates through the array using `enumerate` to check if the element is present in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with the boolean value `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with the boolean value `False` and the index `-1`, as per the problem description.

The program always returns a tuple with a boolean value indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if not found), which aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
