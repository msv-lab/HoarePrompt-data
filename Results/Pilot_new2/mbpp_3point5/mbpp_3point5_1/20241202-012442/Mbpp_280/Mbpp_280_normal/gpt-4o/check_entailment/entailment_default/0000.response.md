Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in an array `arr` and an element `element`, then iterates through the array to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the element in the array. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The function seems to follow the problem description accurately, as it correctly identifies whether the element is present in the array and returns the index if it is found. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description. The output hints also align with the code, confirming that the function is implemented as per the problem requirements.
