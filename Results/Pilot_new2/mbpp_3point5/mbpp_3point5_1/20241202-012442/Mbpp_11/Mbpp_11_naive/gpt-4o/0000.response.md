Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. The logic used to find the first and last index of the character is correct. The slicing operation `s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]` effectively removes the first and last occurrences of the character. The provided test cases also pass, confirming the correctness of the program for those cases.
