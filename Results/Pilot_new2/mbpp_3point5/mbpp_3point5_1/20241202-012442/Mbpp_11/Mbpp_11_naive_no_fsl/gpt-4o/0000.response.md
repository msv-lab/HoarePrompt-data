Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the character to be removed is at the beginning or at the end of the string. For example, if we call the function with `func_1('abc', 'a')`, the expected output should be `'bc'`, but the program will return `'bc'`. This means the first occurrence of the character 'a' at index 0 is not removed.
