Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem description. It checks if the first and last occurrences of the given character `ch` are present in the string `s`. If either of them is not found or if they are the same, it returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it removes the characters between the first and last occurrences of `ch` (exclusive) from the string and returns the modified string.

The program handles all potential cases outlined in the problem description and follows the requirements accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
