#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.**
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is a string, ch is a single character string, first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found, last_index is the index of the last occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found. first_index is not equal to -1 and last_index is not equal to -1 and first_index is not equal to last_index
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns string s with the characters between the first occurrence of ch (exclusive) and the last occurrence of ch (exclusive) removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. If the first occurrence of `ch` is not found in `s`, or the last occurrence of `ch` is not found in `s`, or if the first and last occurrences of `ch` are the same, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, the function returns a modified string where the characters between the first occurrence of `ch` (exclusive) and the last occurrence of `ch` (exclusive) are removed.
