Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes in a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It then finds the index of the first and last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. If either the first occurrence or last occurrence of `ch` is not found, or if both occurrences are the same (meaning there is only one occurrence), the function returns the original string `s`.

If the first and last occurrences are found and they are not the same, the function returns a new string that is formed by concatenating the substring of `s` from the beginning up to (but not including) the first occurrence of `ch`, the substring of `s` from after the first occurrence up to (but not including) the last occurrence of `ch`, and the substring of `s` from after the last occurrence to the end.

The program correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string as per the problem description.
