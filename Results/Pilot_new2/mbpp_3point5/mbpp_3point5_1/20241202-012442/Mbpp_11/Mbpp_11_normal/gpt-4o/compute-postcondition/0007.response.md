Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. If the first occurrence of `ch` is not found in `s`, or the last occurrence of `ch` is not found in `s`, or if the first and last occurrences of `ch` are the same, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, the function returns a modified string where the characters between the first occurrence of `ch` (exclusive) and the last occurrence of `ch` (exclusive) are removed.**
