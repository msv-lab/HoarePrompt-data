The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. The program then calculates the length of the longest sublist within the list 'list_of_lists' and stores this length in the variable 'max_length'. The function returns the value stored in 'max_length', which represents the length of the longest sublist in the input list.
