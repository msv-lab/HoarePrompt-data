Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately find the length of the longest sublist as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` simply iterates over each sublist in the input list and compares the length of each sublist to the current maximum length, updating the `max_length` variable if a longer sublist is found. However, this does not find the length of the longest sublist across all sublists in the list_of_lists. 

For example, in the list `[[1], [1, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]`, the actual longest sublist is `[5, 6, 7, 8]` with a length of 4. The current implementation would return the length of the first sublist `[1]` as 1, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
