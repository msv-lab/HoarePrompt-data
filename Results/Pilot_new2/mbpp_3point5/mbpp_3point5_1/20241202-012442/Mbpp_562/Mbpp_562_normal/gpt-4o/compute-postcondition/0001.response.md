According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists` variable. If the list has at least 1 sublist, the loop will execute. Since `max_length` is 0, it doesn't impact the execution of the loop. 

For the loop to execute, the `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist. 
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is 0**
