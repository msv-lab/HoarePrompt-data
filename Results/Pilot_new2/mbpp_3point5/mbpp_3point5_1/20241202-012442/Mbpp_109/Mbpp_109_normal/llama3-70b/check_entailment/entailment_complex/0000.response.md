Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, repeats the string `s` to have a length greater than `n`, and then calculates the sum of the counts of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `n`. It returns this sum modulo 2 as required by the problem description. The program also handles cases where the binary string `s` is shorter than `n` by repeating it accordingly. So, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
