Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to follow the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, then repeats the binary string `s` to have a length greater than `n`. It calculates the sum of the counts of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `n` and returns this sum modulo 2. The code correctly handles cases where the binary string `s` is shorter than `n` by repeating it accordingly.

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function accurately counts the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. Therefore, based on the problem description and output hints, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
