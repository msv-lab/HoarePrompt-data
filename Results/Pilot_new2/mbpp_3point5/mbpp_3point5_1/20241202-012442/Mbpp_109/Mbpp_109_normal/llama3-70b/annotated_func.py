#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string, and n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times, `count` is the sum of the counts of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `len(s)` modulo 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is the last substring of `s` of length `len(s)`
    return count
    #The program returns the sum of the counts of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `len(s)` modulo 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It repeats the binary string `s` to have a length greater than `n`, then calculates the sum of the counts of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `n` and returns this sum modulo 2. It correctly handles cases where the binary string `s` is shorter than `n` by repeating it accordingly.
