Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. It repeats the binary string `s` to a length that is at least `n`, then iterates over the string by taking substrings of length `len(s)` and counts the number of '1's in each substring. It then adds this count to the total count only if the count is odd. This ensures that the program accurately counts the numbers with an odd value. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
