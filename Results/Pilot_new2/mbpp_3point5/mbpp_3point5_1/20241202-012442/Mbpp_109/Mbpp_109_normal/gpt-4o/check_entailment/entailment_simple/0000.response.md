Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It rotates a binary string the given number of times and counts how many times the resulting integer value is odd. The program ensures that the binary string is rotated correctly by moving the last character to the beginning, converting it to an integer value, and checking if it's odd. The count of odd integer values is then returned as the result, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. Hence, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
