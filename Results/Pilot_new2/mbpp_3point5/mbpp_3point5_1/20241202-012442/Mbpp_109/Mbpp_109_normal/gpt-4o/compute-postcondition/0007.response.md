According to the code, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` has its last character moved to the beginning, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `count` is 1, and `integer_value` is odd. For the loop to execute one more time, the `num_rotations` should be greater than 1.
State: **`binary_str` is a string containing only '0's and '1's with the last character moved to the beginning, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `count` is 1, `integer_value` is odd**
