According to the code, the loop can execute based on the `num_rotations` variable. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer greater than 1. Since num_rotations is decremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `num_rotations` must be greater than 0.
State: **`binary_str` is a string containing only '1's and '0's with the last character moved to the beginning, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `count` is 2 if `integer_value` is odd**
