Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly divides two lists element-wise only if both lists are of the same length. It raises a `ValueError` if the lengths are different, as expected. Additionally, it uses list comprehension along with the `zip` function to perform the element-wise division, ensuring that each element in the result corresponds to elements in the same position in the input lists. This implementation covers all potential cases and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
