Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists of numbers with the same length and returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. The code correctly implements this logic using list comprehension and the `zip` function.

The code does not explicitly check for division by zero, so if any element in `list2` is 0, it will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`. However, this is not mentioned in the problem description. 

All the provided test cases pass successfully, and the code aligns with the problem description. Since there are no edge cases mentioned in the description, and the code handles the given examples correctly, the correctness is considered as **True**.
