#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return [(a / b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. Both list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, which are lists of numbers with the same length. It then returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. There are no explicit checks for division by zero, so if any element in list2 is 0, it will result in a ZeroDivisionError.
