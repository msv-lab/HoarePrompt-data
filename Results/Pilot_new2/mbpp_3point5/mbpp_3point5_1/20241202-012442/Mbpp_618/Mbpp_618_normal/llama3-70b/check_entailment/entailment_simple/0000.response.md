Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the annotated code correctly implements the problem description. It divides two lists element-wise and returns a new list with the results. It first checks if the two input lists are of the same length, and raises a ValueError if they are not. Then, it uses list comprehension to divide each pair of corresponding elements from the two input lists.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and handles the case where the input lists are not of the same length by raising a ValueError, it can be considered correct.
