Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided defines a function called `func_1` that takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, of the same length containing integers. The program first checks if the length of `list1` is equal to the length of `list2`, and if not, a `ValueError` is raised as specified in the problem description.

If the lengths are the same, the program then uses list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. This matches the requirements of the problem description.

Overall, the program does exactly what the problem description asks for every potential case. It divides two lists element-wise only if they are of the same length, and raises an error otherwise. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
