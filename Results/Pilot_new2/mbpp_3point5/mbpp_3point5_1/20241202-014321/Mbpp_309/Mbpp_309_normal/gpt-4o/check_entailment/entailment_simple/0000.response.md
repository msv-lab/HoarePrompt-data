Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two integers `a` and `b` and returns the maximum of the two numbers. The program uses a ternary operator to check if `a` is greater than `b`, if true, it returns `a`, otherwise it returns `b`. This logic correctly finds the maximum of two numbers, as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
