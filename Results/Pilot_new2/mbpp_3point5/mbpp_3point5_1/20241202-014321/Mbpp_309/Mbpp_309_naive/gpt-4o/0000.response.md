Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly finds the maximum of two numbers by using a ternary operator to return the larger of the two numbers. The program includes test cases using the `assert` statement to verify the correctness of the function for different input scenarios. The test cases cover positive, negative, and equal number scenarios, and the function passes all the test cases, demonstrating that it works as expected for all potential cases.
