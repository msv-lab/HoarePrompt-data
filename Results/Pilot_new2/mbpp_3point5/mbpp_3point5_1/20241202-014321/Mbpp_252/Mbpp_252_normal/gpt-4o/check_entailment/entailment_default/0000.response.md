Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes a complex number 'num' as input and calculates its polar coordinates (r, phi) using the `cmath.polar()` function. The code matches the problem description and the output hints. The function seems to be correctly implemented and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or output hints that suggest otherwise. Thus, the code is correct in all potential cases.
