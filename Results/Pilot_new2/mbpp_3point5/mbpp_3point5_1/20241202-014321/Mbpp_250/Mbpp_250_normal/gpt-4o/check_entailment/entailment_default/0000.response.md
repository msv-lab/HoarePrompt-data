Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and returns the number of occurrences of the `element` in the `tup` using the `count` method of tuples. The code aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the function should count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. Additionally, the examples provided in the code assert statements also demonstrate that the function works correctly for those cases. Since the function works as expected for all potential cases as described in the problem statement, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
