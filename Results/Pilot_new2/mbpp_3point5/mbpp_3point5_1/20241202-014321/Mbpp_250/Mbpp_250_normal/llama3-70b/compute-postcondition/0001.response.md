The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `elem`, which can be any data type. The function returns the number of times the element `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and return the count of how many times `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the number of times `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`.**
