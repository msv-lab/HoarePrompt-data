Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. This exactly matches the problem description, which requires the function to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
