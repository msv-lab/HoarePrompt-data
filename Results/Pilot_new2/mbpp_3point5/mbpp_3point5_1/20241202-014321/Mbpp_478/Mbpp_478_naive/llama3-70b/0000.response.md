Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description. The program is removing lowercase characters from the given string instead of removing lowercase substrings. For example, for the input "HelloWorld", the expected output should be "HW" according to the problem description. However, the program will output "HW" which is incorrect as it is just removing lowercase characters.
