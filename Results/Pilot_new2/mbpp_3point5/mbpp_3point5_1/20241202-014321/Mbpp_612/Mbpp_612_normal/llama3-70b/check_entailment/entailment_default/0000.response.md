Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns two listsâ€”one containing the first elements and the other containing the second elements of each sublist in the input list_of_lists. The code achieves this by using list comprehension to extract the first and second elements of each sublist in the input list. Since the code aligns with the problem description and there are no edge cases identified where it might fail, the correctness of the code is true.
