Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. The function then extracts all the first elements of the sublists to form the first list and all the second elements to form the second list. Finally, it returns a list of two lists, with the first list containing all the first elements and the second list containing all the second elements. This exactly matches the requirements stated in the problem description. 

The program is correct because it consistently follows the problem description for every potential case.
