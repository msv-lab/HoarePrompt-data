#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    first_elements = [sublist[0] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    second_elements = [sublist[1] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
    #The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains all the first elements of the sublists in list_of_lists and the second list contains all the second elements of the sublists in list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It then extracts all the first elements of the sublists to form the first list and all the second elements to form the second list. Finally, it returns a list of two lists, with the first list containing all the first elements and the second list containing all the second elements.
