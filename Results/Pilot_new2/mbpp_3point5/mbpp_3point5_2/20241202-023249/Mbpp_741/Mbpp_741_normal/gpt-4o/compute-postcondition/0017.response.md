Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. The function checks if the string `s` is empty, and if so, it returns True. If `s` is not empty, it compares all characters in the string to the first character. It returns True if all characters are the same as the first character, otherwise it returns False. The function may not handle the case where the input string is None or has special characters beyond the basic alphabet or numbers as the conditions focus on character equality within the string.**
