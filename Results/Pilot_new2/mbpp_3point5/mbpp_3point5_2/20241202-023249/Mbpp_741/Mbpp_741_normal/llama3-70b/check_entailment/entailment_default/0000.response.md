Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code checks if the length of the set of characters in the input string `s` is equal to 1, which means all characters in the string are the same. This logic exactly follows the problem description, which states that the function returns True if all characters in the string 's' are the same; otherwise, it returns False. The code covers all potential cases where the input string has the same characters, making it a correct implementation for the given problem description.
