Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function checks if a specified list is sorted by comparing each element with the next one. It iterates through the list and returns False if it finds a pair of elements that are not in ascending order. If all elements are in ascending order, it returns True. This logic covers all potential cases where the list is not sorted according to the problem description.
