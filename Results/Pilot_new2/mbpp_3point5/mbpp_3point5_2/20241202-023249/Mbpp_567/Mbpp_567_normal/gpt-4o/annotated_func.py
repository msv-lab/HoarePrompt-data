#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **lst is a list of comparable elements.**
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: lst is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements. If the loop executes, it means that all elements in lst are in non-decreasing order. If at any point lst[i] > lst[i + 1], the function will return False and the loop will terminate. Otherwise, the loop will continue until the end of the list is reached.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, it will return False and terminate the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function func_1 accepts a list lst of comparable elements. It iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If at any point an element is greater than the next one, the function returns False. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, the function returns True. The function terminates the loop as soon as it encounters the first out-of-order element. It does not handle cases where the input list has less than 2 elements or contains non-comparable elements.
