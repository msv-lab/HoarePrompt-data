Output State: lst is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements. If the loop executes, it means that all elements in lst are in non-decreasing order. If at any point lst[i] > lst[i + 1], the function will return False and the loop will terminate. Otherwise, the loop will continue until the end of the list is reached.
