According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the precondition is that `lst` is a list of comparable elements, so no adjustment is needed for that. The loop will execute as long as there are at least 2 elements in the list, so the states need to be adjusted to `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0.
State: **Precondition: lst is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, i is 0**
