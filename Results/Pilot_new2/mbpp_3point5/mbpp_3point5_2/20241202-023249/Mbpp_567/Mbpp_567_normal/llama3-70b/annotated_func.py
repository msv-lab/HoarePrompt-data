#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.**
def func_1(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))
    #The program returns True if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list lst of comparable elements. It returns True if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
