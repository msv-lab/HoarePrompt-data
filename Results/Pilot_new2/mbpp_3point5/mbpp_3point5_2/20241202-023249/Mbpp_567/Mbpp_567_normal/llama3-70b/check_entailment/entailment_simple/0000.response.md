Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input. It then uses a list comprehension to check if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order by comparing each element with the next element in the list. If all elements satisfy the condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This program follows the problem description accurately as it checks whether a specified list is sorted or not, returning `True` if it is sorted and `False` if it is not. The list comprehension used in the function efficiently checks each pair of adjacent elements in the list to determine if they are in non-decreasing order, making the program correct for all potential cases.
