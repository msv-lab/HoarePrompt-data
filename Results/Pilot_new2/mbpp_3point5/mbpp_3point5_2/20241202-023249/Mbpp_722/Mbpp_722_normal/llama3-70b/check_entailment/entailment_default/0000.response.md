Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_data` containing student names as keys and tuples of float values (student_height, student_weight) as values, along with minimum height and minimum weight values. The function filters the student data based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. It then returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, satisfying the filtering condition.

The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly filters the student data based on the given conditions and returns the expected output. Additionally, there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code might not handle, and the output hints also agree with the code's functionality. Therefore, the code can be considered correct.
