#State of the program right berfore the function call: student_data is a dictionary where keys are student names and values are tuples of float (student_height, student_weight). min_height and min_weight are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively.**
def func_1(student_data, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in student_data.
    items() if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, for students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a dictionary containing student data, along with minimum height and minimum weight values. It filters the student data based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. The function then returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, satisfying the filtering condition.
