The function func_1 accepts a dictionary containing student data, along with minimum height and minimum weight values. It filters the student data based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. The function then returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, satisfying the filtering condition.
