Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function called `func_1` that takes in three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. It then filters the `student_dict` based on the conditions that the height of the student is greater than or equal to `min_height` and the weight of the student is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The program returns a dictionary containing only the students that meet these criteria.

This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should filter students based on their height and weight being above the minimum values provided. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
