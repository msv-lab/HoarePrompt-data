The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names and values are tuples of two floats (student_height, student_weight). The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively.

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of student names and their corresponding heights and weights, but only for students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary of student information, a minimum height, and a minimum weight, and return a filtered dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.
