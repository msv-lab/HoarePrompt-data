Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a student dictionary, minimal height, and minimal weight as input. It filters the students in the dictionary based on whether their height is above or equal to the minimal height and their weight is above or equal to the minimal weight.

The program then provides three test cases to verify the correctness of the function. In each test case, the input dictionary contains different students with their corresponding heights and weights. The function is called with different minimal height and weight values to filter out the students accordingly.

Upon examining the code and the test cases provided, it can be observed that the function correctly filters the students based on the given criteria in all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
