Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the sum of even pairs and odd pairs. Even pairs are computed by multiplying the count of even numbers by one less than that count and dividing by 2. Similarly, odd pairs are calculated using the count of odd numbers in the list. The function then returns the sum of these even and odd pairs. **
