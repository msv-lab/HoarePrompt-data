Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. The program uses two nested loops to iterate through all valid pairs of elements in the list, calculates the XOR of the pair, and checks if the result is even. If the XOR is even, it increments the count. Finally, the function returns the total count of such pairs.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases where pairs of integers XOR to an even number. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
