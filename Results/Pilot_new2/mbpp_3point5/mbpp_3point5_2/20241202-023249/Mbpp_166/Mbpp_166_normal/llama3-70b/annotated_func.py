#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.**
def func_1(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: nums is a list of integers, count is the total number of times ((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0) is true for all valid pairs of i and j
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of times the condition ((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0) is true for all valid pairs of i and j
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It iterates through all valid pairs of elements in the list and counts the total number of pairs where the bitwise XOR operation between the pair results in an even number. The function then returns this count as the output. The function accurately calculates the total number of valid pairs where the condition ((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0) is true.
