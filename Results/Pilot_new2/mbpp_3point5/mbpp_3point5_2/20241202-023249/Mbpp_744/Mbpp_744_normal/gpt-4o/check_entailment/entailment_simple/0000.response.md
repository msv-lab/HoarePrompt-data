Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through each item in the tuple and checks if any of them are `None`. If it finds a `None` value, it immediately returns `True`. If there are no `None` values in the tuple, it returns `False`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for, making the program correct.
