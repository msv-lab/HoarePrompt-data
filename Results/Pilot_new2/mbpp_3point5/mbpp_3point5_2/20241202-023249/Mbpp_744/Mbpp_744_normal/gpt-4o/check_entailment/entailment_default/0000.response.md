Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that iterates through the input tuple `tup` and checks if there is any `None` value present. If a `None` value is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should return True if there is any `None` value in the tuple, and False otherwise. 

Additionally, the output hints confirm the functionality of the code by mentioning that the function will always return False if there are no `None` values in the tuple. Since the code handles all cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints support the correctness of the code, we can conclude that the program is correct.
