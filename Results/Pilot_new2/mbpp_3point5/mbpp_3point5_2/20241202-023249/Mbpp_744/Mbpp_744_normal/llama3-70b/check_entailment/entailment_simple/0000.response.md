Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses the `any` function in combination with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is `None`. If any element is `None`, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This implementation correctly addresses the problem description by checking for the presence of `None` values in the given tuple. So, the program is correct.
