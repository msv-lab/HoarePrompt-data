Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code checks if there is any element in the tuple that is None by using the `any()` function along with a generator expression that checks if each element is None. This follows the problem description accurately. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function should return True if there is any None element in the tuple, and False otherwise. Since the code and the description align perfectly and there are no edge cases identified where the code might fail, we can conclude that the code is correct.
