Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. It then returns two listsâ€”one containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists` and the other containing the second element of each sublist. The code aligns with the provided annotations and correctly extracts the first and second elements of each sublist.**
