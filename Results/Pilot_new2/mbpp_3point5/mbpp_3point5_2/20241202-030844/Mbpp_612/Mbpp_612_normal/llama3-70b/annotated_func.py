#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list(element[0] for element in list_of_lists), list(element[1] for
    element in list_of_lists)]
    #The program returns two lists, the first list contains the first element of each sublist in list_of_lists and the second list contains the second element of each sublist in list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. It then returns two listsâ€”one containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists` and the other containing the second element of each sublist. The code aligns with the provided annotations and correctly extracts the first and second elements of each sublist.
