Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input. It correctly creates two lists using list comprehension where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. This aligns with the problem description which states that the function should return a list of two lists with the specified elements extracted from the input list of lists.

The program is correct as it always returns the expected output based on the problem description.
