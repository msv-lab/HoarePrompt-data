#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    first_elements = [sublist[0] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    second_elements = [sublist[1] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
    #The program returns a list containing `first_elements` which is a list containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists` and `second_elements` which is a list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It then extracts the first elements of each sublist into a list named first_elements and the second elements into a list named second_elements. Finally, it returns a list containing these two lists, first_elements and second_elements. The function accurately follows the annotations provided.
