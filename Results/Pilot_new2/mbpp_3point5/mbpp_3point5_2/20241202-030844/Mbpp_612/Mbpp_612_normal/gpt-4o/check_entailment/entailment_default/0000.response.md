Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist has two elements. It then extracts the first elements of each sublist into a list named `first_elements` and the second elements into a list named `second_elements`. Finally, it returns a list containing these two lists, `first_elements` and `second_elements`. The code accurately follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly constructs the output lists as required. Additionally, the output hints provided align with the code and further confirm that the code is correct in its implementation.
