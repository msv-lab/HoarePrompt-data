The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the program returns a list containing `first_elements`, which is a list containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `second_elements`, which is a list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists `list_of_lists` and return two lists - one containing the first elements of each sublist and the other containing the second elements of each sublist. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns two lists - one containing the first elements of each sublist, and the other containing the second elements of each sublist.**
