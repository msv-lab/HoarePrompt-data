Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it is missing the `import cmath` statement. Since the program uses `cmath.phase()` to calculate the phase of the complex number, the `cmath` module needs to be imported. Without this import statement, the program will result in a NameError when trying to use `cmath.phase()`.
