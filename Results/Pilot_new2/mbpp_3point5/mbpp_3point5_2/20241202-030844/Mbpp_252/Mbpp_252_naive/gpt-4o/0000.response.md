Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it uses `cmath` library to calculate the polar coordinates of a complex number, but the function `func_1` does not import the `cmath` library. Additionally, the function `func_1` takes an integer input instead of a complex number, which will lead to a `TypeError`. The program will not work as expected for all potential cases as it is missing necessary imports and does not handle complex numbers as required in the problem description.
