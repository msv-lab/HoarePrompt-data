Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns its absolute value and phase, which aligns with the problem description of converting complex numbers to polar coordinates. The code accurately calculates and returns these two values for any given complex number, meeting the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct in this case.
