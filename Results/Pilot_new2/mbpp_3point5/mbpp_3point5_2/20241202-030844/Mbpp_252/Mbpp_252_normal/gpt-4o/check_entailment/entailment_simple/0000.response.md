Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes a complex number as input and returns its polar coordinates as a tuple (r, phi) where r is the magnitude and phi is the phase angle in radians. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The program uses the cmath library to calculate the polar coordinates of the complex number, which is the correct approach for this task. Therefore, the program is correct.
