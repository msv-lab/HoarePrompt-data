Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that accepts a complex number `num` and returns its polar coordinates in the form of a tuple `(r, phi)`, where `r` is the magnitude and `phi` is the phase angle in radians. The program utilizes the `cmath` library to calculate the polar coordinates, as specified in the problem description. The comments within the code also provide a clear explanation of what the function does.
