Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the input string by using a generator expression to iterate over each character in the string and only including uppercase characters. This logic covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description. Additionally, since the function is only filtering out lowercase characters, there is no chance of any other characters being affected or removed from the original string.
