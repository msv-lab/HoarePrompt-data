Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in the `func_1` function accurately counts the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup` and returns that count, which aligns with the problem description. The function directly uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which efficiently counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. This code snippet does not have any missing functionality or edge cases, as it covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Since the code matches the problem description and the output hints do not provide any conflicting scenarios, we can conclude that the code is correct.
