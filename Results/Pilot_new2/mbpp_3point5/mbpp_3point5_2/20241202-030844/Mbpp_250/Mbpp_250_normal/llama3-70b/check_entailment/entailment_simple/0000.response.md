Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`. It then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup` and returns the count.

This program meets the requirements of the problem description as it accurately counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The `count` method is specifically designed to count occurrences of elements in a tuple, so the program is correct for all potential cases.
