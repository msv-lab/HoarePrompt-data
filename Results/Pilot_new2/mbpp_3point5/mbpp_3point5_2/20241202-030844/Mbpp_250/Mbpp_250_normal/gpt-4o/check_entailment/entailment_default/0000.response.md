Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element, then returns the count of occurrences of that element in the tuple. The code uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to accurately count the occurrences of the element. The function is simple and straightforward, directly tackling the problem described in the prompt. 

The code matches the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also confirm that the function accurately counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. Therefore, the code is correct.
