Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and then uses the `count` method of tuples in Python to count the occurrences of the `element` in the `tup`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asked for a function that counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple.

Therefore, the program is correct as it fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
