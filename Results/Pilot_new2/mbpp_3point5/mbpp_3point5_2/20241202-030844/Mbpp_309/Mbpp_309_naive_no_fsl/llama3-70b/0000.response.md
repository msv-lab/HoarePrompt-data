Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns the maximum of the two numbers using the built-in `max` function. This implementation correctly finds the maximum of two numbers as per the problem description. The function will work correctly for all possible inputs, as the `max` function inherently handles comparison between two numbers and returns the maximum. Thus, the program is correct for finding the maximum of two numbers.
