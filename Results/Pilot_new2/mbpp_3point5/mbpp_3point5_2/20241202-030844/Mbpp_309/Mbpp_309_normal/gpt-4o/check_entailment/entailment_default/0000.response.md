Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the larger integer between them. If `a` is equal to `b`, the code will return `a`.
The code is straightforward and the logic is correct. The function correctly returns the maximum of two numbers as per the problem description. Additionally, the output hints align with the code by stating that the function returns the larger of the two integers provided. Since the code is meeting the requirements of the problem description and the output hints are in agreement with the code logic, we can conclude that the code is correct.
