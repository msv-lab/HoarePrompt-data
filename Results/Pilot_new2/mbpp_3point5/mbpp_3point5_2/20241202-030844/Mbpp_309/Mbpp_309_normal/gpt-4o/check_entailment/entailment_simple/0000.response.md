Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer arguments `a` and `b`. It then uses a ternary operator to return the maximum of the two numbers by checking if `a` is greater than `b`. This logic correctly implements the problem description, which asks for finding the maximum of two numbers. The program always returns the correct maximum value between the two integers provided.
