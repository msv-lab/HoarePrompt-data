Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the larger integer between them. The program uses a ternary operator to check if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, returns `a`, otherwise returns `b`. This logic correctly implements the problem description of finding the maximum of two numbers.

Since the program returns the larger integer between `a` and `b` as stated in the problem description, it is correct.
