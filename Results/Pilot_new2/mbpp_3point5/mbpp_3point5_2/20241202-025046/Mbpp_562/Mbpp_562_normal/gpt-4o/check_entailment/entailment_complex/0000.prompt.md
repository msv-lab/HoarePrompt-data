You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the length of the longest sublists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        if len(sublist) > max_length:
            max_length = len(sublist)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist. `max_length` is updated to the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`
    return max_length
    #The program returns the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It iterates through the sublists to find the maximum length and returns that value as the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
