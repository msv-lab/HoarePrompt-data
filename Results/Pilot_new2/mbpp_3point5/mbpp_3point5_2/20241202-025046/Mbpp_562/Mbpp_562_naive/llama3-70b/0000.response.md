Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function iterates through each sublist in the input list and calculates the length of each sublist using a generator expression. It then returns the maximum length of the sublists. This logic aligns with the problem description of finding the length of the longest sublist in the given list of sublists. The code covers all potential cases and works as expected.
