Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and compares the length of each sublist with the current `max_length`. If a sublist has a greater length, it updates `max_length` accordingly. The function then returns the correct longest sublist length for each provided test case. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
