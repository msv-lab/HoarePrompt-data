Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, a list `arr`, and an element `elem` of any data type. It iterates through the list to find the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is found, the function returns True along with the index of that element in the list. If `elem` is not found, the function returns False along with the index of -1. The functionality does not cover the cases mentioned in the annotations where `elem` is found at specific indices (0, 1, 2) as the function only returns the first occurrence.**
