According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, `elem` can be any data type, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list, and the first element of the list `arr` is not equal to `elem`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` should be increased by 1, and `x` should be the second element in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` can be any data type, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list**
