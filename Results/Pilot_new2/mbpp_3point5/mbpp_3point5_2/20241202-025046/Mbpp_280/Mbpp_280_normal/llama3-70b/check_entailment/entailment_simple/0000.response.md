Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately follows the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns True along with the index of the element in the array. If the element is not found, it returns False along with the index of -1. This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirements specified in the problem description. The program handles all potential cases and returns the expected output.
