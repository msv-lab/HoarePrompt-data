Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `elem` can be any data type, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in the list. If the second element of `arr` is equal to `elem`, the function returns True along with the value 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
