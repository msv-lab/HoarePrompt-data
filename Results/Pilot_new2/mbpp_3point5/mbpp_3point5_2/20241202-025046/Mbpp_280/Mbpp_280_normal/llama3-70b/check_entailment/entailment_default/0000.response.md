Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the list `arr` to find the first occurrence of the element `elem`. If `elem` is found, the function returns True along with the index of that element in the list. If `elem` is not found, the function returns False along with the index of -1. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, as it correctly returns True with the index if the element is found and False with index -1 if the element is not found. The output hints also align with the code and confirm its correctness.
