The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `arr` containing elements of any data type, and an `element` which can be any data type. 

The function has multiple cases based on the elements in the list `arr`:
- Case 1: If the `element` is equal to the first element in the list `arr`, the function returns True and the index of the first element in the list `arr`. The value of `value` is equal to the first element in the list.
- Case 2: If the `element` is equal to the second element in the list `arr`, the function returns True and the index of the second element in the list `arr`.
- Case 3: If the `element` is equal to the third element in the list `arr`, the function returns True and the index of the third element in the list `arr`.
- Case 4: If the `element` is not found in the list `arr`, the function returns False and -1 as the index value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and based on the relationship between the `element` and elements in the list `arr`, return True along with the index of the element or return False along with -1.
