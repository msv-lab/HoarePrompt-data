According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `index` is the index of the first element in the list, and `value` is the value of the first element.
State: **`arr` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `index` is the index of the first element in the list, `value` is the value of the first element**
