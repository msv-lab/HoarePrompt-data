Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function correctly iterates through the input array using enumerate to check if the element exists in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index position. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs.
