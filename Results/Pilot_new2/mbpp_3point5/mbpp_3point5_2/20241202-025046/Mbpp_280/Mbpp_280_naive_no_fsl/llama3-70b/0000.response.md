Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the array and checks if the element is equal to the current element in the iteration. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple containing True and the index of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple containing False and -1. This logic follows the problem description accurately, and the program covers all potential cases.
