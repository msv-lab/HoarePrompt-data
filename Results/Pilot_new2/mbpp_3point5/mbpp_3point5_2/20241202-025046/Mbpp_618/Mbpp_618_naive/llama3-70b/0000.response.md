Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the two input lists `list1` and `list2` have the same length. If they do not have the same length, it raises a `ValueError`, as per the problem description. If the lists have the same length, the function then proceeds to divide the elements of the two lists element-wise using list comprehension and the `zip` function. This implementation aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
