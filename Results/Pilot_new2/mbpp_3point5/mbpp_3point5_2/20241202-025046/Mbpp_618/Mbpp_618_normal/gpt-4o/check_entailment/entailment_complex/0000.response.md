Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists of integers as input. It then uses list comprehension along with the `zip` function to iterate over both lists simultaneously and divide the corresponding elements. The resulting list contains the division of each pair of elements from `list1` and `list2`.

Since the program accurately divides the elements of `list1` by the elements of `list2` and returns a new list with the results, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Additionally, the program explicitly states that both input lists must have the same length for the division operation to be accurate, which is in line with the problem description.
