#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers of the same length.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if (len(list1) != len(list2)) :
        raise ValueError('Both lists must be of the same length')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *list1 and list2 are lists of numbers of the same length. If the length of list1 is not equal to the length of list2, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Otherwise, there are no changes to the lists.
    return [(x / y) for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a list of the result of dividing each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers of the same length. It then divides each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2` and returns a new list containing the results. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. The function does not handle potential division by zero errors, so this could be a missing edge case to consider.
