Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input. It then rotates the binary string the given number of times and checks if the resulting integer value is odd. If it is odd, it increments the count. The program then returns the count. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the program works as expected for all of them. Therefore, the program is correct.
