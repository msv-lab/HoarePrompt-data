Example Answer:
The binary string `s` is repeated enough times to make the length of `s` greater than or equal to `n` by multiplying it with `(n // len(s) + 1)`. The value of `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a binary string repeated enough times to make its length greater than or equal to n; n is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **s is a binary string repeated enough times to make its length greater than or equal to n; n is a non-negative integer**
