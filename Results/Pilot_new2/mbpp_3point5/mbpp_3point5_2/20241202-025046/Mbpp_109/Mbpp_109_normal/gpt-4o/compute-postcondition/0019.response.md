The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str`, which is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and `num_rotations`, which is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of times the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` is odd. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, and return the number of times the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` is odd.
