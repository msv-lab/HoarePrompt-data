Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `binary_str` has been rotated to move the last character to the front. `num_rotations` is equal to the previous value. `count` is either 3 or 4 based on the new `integer_value` after rotation. If `integer_value` % 2 == 1, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2. `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` in base 2.***
