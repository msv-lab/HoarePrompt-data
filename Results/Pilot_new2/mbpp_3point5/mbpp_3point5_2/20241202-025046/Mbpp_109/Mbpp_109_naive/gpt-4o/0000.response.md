The given program correctly rotates the binary string the given number of times and counts the number of odd values after each rotation. The logic of the program is correct as it converts the binary string to an integer and checks if it's odd. The program passes all the provided test cases and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
