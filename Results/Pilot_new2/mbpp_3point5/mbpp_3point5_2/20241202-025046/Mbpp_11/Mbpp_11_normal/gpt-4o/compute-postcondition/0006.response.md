The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a string of length 1. 

Case 1: The function returns the string `s`.

Case 2: The function returns a new string obtained by removing the character at the first_index and last_index from the original string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, and based on the cases described above, return either the original string `s` or a new string with the character at the first and last index removed.
