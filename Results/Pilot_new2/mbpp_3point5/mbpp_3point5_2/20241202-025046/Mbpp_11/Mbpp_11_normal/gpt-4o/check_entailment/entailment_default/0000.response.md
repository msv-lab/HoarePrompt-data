Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not handle the case where the character `ch` appears only once in the string `s`. In this scenario, the function should return the original string `s` unchanged, but the current implementation removes the character at the first occurrence and the character at the last occurrence, resulting in an incorrect output.

For example:
- `func_1('abcde', 'd')` should return `'abce'` but the code will incorrectly return `'abce'`.
