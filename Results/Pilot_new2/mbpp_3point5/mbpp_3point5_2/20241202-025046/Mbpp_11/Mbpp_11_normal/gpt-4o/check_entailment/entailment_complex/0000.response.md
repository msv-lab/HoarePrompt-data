Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the function `func_1` based on the given problem description. The function removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the input string `s` and returns the modified string. 

The program handles the cases where the character `ch` is not found in the string or where the first and last occurrences of `ch` are the same. In those cases, the program correctly returns the original string `s`. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
