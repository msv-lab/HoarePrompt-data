You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a string of length 1.**
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns string s
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is a string, ch is a string of length 1, first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found in s, last_index is the index of the last occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found in s. The first_index is not -1, last_index is not -1, and first_index is not equal to last_index.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns a new string obtained by removing the character at first_index and last_index from the original string s
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`, and returns a new string obtained by removing the character at the first and last occurrence of `ch` in the original string `s`. If either the first index or last index is not found, or if both indices are the same, the function returns the original string `s`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
