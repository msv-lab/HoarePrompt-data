The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` (a string) and `c` (a character). 
Case_1: The program returns the string `s` with the character at index `first_occ` removed along with the characters between `first_occ` and `last_occ`, and the character at index `last_occ` removed.
Case_2: The program returns the string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `c`, and based on certain conditions, it may modify the string `s` and return the updated string or return the original string `s`.
