Correctness: **False**

The code does not completely follow the problem description. The function is supposed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the implementation is incorrect. The code only removes the character at the first occurrence index and the character at the last occurrence index but leaves the characters between them. This is not in line with the problem description which mentions removing the characters between the first and last occurrences as well. 

For example, if we have a string "hello world" and we want to remove the first and last occurrences of the character 'o', the expected output should be "hell world" where both 'o's are removed, including the characters in between them. However, the current implementation will only remove the first 'o' and the last 'o' but not the characters in between, resulting in "hell wrld".

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
