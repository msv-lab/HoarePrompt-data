Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a character `c`. If both the first and last occurrences of the character `c` are found in the string `s`, it returns `s` with the character at index `first_occ` removed, along with the characters between `first_occ` and `last_occ`, and the character at index `last_occ` removed. If either the first or last occurrence of the character `c` is not found, the function returns the original string `s`.**
