Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively iterating through each element. It checks if the element is a list, and if so, calls the function again on that list. This process continues until all nested lists are flattened. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for any nested list input.
