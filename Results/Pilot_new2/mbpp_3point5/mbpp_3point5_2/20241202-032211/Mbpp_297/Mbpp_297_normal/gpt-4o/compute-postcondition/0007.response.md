According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list has at least 1 element, and item is the first element in nested_list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the nested_list must have at least 2 elements, and item is the second element in the list.
State: **`flat_list` is a list. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` will contain elements returned by `func_1(item)`. `nested_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and `item` is the second element in `nested_list`. If `item` is not a list, `flat_list` will contain `item` itself.**
