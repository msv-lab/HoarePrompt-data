The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a list that may contain nested lists. After executing the function body, the program returns `flat_list`, which is a list containing elements returned by `func_1(item)` for every element in `nested_list` that is a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list` that may contain nested lists, and return a flat list containing elements returned by `func_1(item)` for each element in the nested list that is a list.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain nested lists. It returns a flat list containing elements returned by `func_1(item)` for every element in `nested_list` that is a list.**
