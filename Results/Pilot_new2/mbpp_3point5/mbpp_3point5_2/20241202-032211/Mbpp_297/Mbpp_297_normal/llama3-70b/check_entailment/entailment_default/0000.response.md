Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the function to flatten a given nested list structure. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a nested list structure, and recursively flattens the nested list by applying `func_1` to any inner lists. It then returns a `flat_list` containing all the elements from the `nested_list` after flattening. The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it effectively flattens nested lists and returns the desired output.
