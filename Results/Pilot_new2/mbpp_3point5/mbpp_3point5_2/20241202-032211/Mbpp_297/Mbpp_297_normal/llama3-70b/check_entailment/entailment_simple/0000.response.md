Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function called `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and flattens it. It uses recursion to flatten the nested list structure by iterating through each element in the list and checking if it is a list itself. If it is a list, it calls the function `func_1` recursively on that element. If it is not a list, it simply appends the element to the `flat_list`. This process continues until all nested lists have been flattened.

The function then returns the `flat_list` which contains all the elements from the nested list after flattening.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly flattens any given nested list structure. The use of recursion allows it to handle nested lists of any depth, ensuring that all elements are flattened into a single list.
