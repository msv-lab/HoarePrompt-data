Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a nested list structure, and recursively flattens the nested list by applying func_1 to any inner lists. It returns a flat_list containing all the elements from the nested_list after flattening. **

The code does indeed recursively flatten the nested list structure by checking each element and calling itself if the element is a list. The final result is the flat_list containing all elements from the nested_list after flattening. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases left unhandled in the provided code snippet.
