#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.**
def func_1(s):
    return s.upper()
    #The program returns the uppercase version of the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns the uppercase version of the string. There are no edge cases or missing functionality as the code aligns with the annotations.
