Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the annotated code successfully converts a given string to uppercase, which aligns with the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. This implementation covers all cases and fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
