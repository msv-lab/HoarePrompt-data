According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since the state before the loop starts is `tup is a tuple`, it needs to be adjusted to `tup` contains at least 1 element.
State: **`tup` is a tuple that must contain at least 1 element**
