Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input. It iterates over each element of the tuple, checking if the element is a tuple itself. If it encounters a tuple element, it breaks out of the loop and returns the count of elements that occurred before the tuple element was encountered.

This implementation correctly follows the problem description as it returns the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple, as stated in the problem description. The program handles the case where no tuple element is present in the tuple by returning the total number of elements in the tuple.
