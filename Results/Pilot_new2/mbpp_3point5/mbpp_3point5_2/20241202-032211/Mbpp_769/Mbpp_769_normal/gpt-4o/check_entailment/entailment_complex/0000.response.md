Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two lists, converts them into sets, finds the symmetric difference between the sets, converts the result into a list, sorts the list based on the index of elements in the concatenated list of the input lists, and returns the sorted list. This is exactly what the problem description asks for.
