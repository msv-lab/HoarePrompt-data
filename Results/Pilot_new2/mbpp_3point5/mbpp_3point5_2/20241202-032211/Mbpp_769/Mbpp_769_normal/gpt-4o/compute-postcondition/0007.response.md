Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two lists list1 and list2, converts them to sets, finds the symmetric difference between the sets, and converts the result into a list. The function then sorts the list based on the index of elements in the concatenated list of list1 and list2. The sorted list is then returned. If the input lists contain duplicate elements, the sorting may not be consistent across different executions.**
