The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. After executing the function body, the program returns a list containing elements from `diff_elements` sorted based on their index in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list with elements from `diff_elements` sorted based on their index in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists list1 and list2, returns a list containing elements from diff_elements sorted based on their index in the concatenated list of list1 and list2.**
