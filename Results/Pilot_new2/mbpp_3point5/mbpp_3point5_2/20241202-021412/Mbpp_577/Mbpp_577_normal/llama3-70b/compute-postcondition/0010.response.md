The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function has multiple return points based on the value of `n`.

Case 1: If `n` is less than 2, the function returns the current value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer and is less than 2.

Case 2: If `n` is either 2 or 3, the function returns the non-negative integer value of `n`, which is either 2 or 3.

Case 3: If `n` is 4, the function returns the integer 4.

Case 4: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return different values based on the conditions specified for each case.
