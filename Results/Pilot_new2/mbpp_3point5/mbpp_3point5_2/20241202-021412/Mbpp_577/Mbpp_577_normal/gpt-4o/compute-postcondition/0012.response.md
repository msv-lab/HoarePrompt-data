The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

In Case 1, the program returns 0.

In Case 2, the program returns the last digit of the factorial of 'n'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 in Case 1, or return the last digit of the factorial of 'n' in Case 2.
