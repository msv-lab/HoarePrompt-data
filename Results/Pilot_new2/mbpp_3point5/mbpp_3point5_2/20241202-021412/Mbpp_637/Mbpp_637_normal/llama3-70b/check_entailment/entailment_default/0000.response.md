Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in the program matches the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes in two non-negative integers, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns True if they are equal; otherwise, it returns False. This logic correctly determines whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code, confirming that the code is correct for all potential cases. Since the code meets the problem requirements and the output hints support its correctness, we can conclude that the code is correct.
