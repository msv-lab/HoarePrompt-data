Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price. If they are equal, it returns True, indicating that there is no profit or loss. If they are not equal, it returns False. This aligns with the problem description of checking if there is no profit and no loss based on the given amount. The program works correctly for all potential cases as it specifically checks for equality between the cost price and selling price.
