Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to check if the given amount has no profit and no loss. Since having the cost price equal to the selling price implies no profit and no loss, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
