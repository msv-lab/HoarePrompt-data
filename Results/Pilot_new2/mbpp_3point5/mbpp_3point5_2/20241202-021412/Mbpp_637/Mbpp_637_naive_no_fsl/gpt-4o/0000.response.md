Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program defines a function that checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price, indicating no profit and no loss. The provided test cases cover scenarios where the cost price is not equal to the selling price, resulting in the function returning False. The test case where the cost price is equal to the selling price returns True, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
