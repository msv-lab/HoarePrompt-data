Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cylinder given the radius and height. The formula used to calculate the volume is correct (Ï€ * r^2 * h) and the program includes assertions with expected values for different inputs. The use of `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001 ensures that the calculated values are very close to the expected values. The program covers multiple test cases and all the calculations seem accurate.
