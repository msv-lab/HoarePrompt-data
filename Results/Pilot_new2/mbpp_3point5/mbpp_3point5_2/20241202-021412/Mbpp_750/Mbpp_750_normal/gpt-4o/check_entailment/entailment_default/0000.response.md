Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, then returns a new list that contains the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tpl`. The code successfully achieves this by using the `+` operator to concatenate the lists. The examples provided in the problem description also confirm that the code is correctly adding the tuple elements to the list. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code and do not provide any conflicting information. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output, making it correct.
