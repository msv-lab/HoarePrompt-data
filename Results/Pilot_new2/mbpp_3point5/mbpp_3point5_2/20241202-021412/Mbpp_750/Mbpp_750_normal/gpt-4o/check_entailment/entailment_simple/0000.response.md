Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input. It then converts the tuple `tpl` into a list and concatenates it with the input list `lst` using the `+` operator. This results in a new list that contains all the elements of the input list `lst` followed by all the elements of the input tuple `tpl`, which is exactly what the problem description requires. Therefore, the program correctly adds the given tuple to the given list as specified in the problem description.
