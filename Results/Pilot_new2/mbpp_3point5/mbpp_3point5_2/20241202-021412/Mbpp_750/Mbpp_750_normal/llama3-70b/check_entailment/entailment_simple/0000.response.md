Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input and returns the concatenation of the list and the elements of the tuple as a list. This matches the problem description, which asks for a function to add the given tuple to the given list. The program always follows the problem description as it correctly concatenates the list and tuple without any issues.
