According to the code, the loop executes based on the range specified by `n`. In this case, the loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3 and `i` is 3. Given the conditions provided:
- If `is_prime[3]` is True, then after the execution, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, `is_prime[3]` is True, and all `is_prime[j]` where j is a multiple of 3 and in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are set to False.
- Additionally, all other `is_prime[j]` where j is not a multiple of 3 in the range `[3, n)` become True.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- Since `i` will be incremented by 1, it will be 4 for the next iteration.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- The conditions specified for `is_prime` array manipulation based on the prime numbers also need to be adjusted according to the updated values of `i` and `n`.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4. If `is_prime[4]` is True, then after the execution, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, `is_prime[3]` is True, and all `is_prime[j]` where j is a multiple of 3 and in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are set to False. Additionally, all other `is_prime[j]` where j is not a multiple of 3 in the range `[3, n)` become True.**
