The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case 1: If the value of `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0.

Case 2: If the value of `n` is greater than 2, the function applies the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to `n`, and then returns the sum of all elements in the `is_prime` list. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, the function calculates the sum of all prime numbers up to `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
