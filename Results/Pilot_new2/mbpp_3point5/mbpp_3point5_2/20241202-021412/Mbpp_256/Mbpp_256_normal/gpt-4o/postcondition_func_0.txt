The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function applies the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to `n`, and then returns the sum of all prime numbers in the list. The function correctly implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine prime numbers and calculates the sum accurately.
