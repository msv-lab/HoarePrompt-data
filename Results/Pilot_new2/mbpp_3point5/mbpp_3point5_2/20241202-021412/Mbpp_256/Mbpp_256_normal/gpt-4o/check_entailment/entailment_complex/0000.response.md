Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to calculate the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`. It handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 2 by returning 0. For `n` greater than 2, the program correctly generates a list of prime numbers using the algorithm and then returns the sum of the prime numbers in the list.

The algorithm ensures that all non-prime numbers are marked as False in the `is_prime` list, leaving only the prime numbers as True. The sum of the True elements in the list gives the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
