Correctness: **True**

The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of boolean values indicating whether each number up to `n` is prime or not. Then, it returns the sum of all `True` values in the list which represent prime numbers.

This program correctly follows the problem description as it takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm efficiently identifies prime numbers up to `n` and the program accurately counts them. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
