According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` is within the range `[i * i, n)` for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows:
- `n` is at least 4
- `i` is 4
- `is_prime[4]` is False
- `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1` are False
- `is_prime[3]` is True
- Multiples of 3 in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are set to False
- All other `is_prime[j]` where `j` is not a multiple of 3 in the range `[3, n)` are True

For the next iteration, the value of `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will become 5. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 5, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1` are False, `is_prime[3]` is True, multiples of 3 in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are set to False, all other `is_prime[j]` where `j` is not a multiple of 3 in the range `[3, n)` are True**
