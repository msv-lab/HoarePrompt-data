You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 when the value of n is less than or equal to 2
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer. n is larger than 2.
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing, all elements of `is_prime` will be updated based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then `is_prime[j]` where j is a multiple of i and in the range `[i * i, n)` will be set to False. All other `is_prime[j]` where j is not a multiple of i in the range `[i, n)` will remain True.
    return sum(is_prime)
    #The program returns the sum of all elements in the `is_prime` list after the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm has been applied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function applies the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to `n`, and then returns the sum of all prime numbers in the list. The function correctly implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine prime numbers and calculates the sum accurately.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
