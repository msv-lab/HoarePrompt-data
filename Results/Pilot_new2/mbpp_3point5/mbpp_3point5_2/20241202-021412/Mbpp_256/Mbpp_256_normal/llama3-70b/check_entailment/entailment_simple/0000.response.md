Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The `func_1` function takes in a non-negative number `n` and correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than `n` by iterating through numbers from 2 to `n-1` and checking if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function.
2. The `is_prime` function correctly determines if a given number `num` is prime by checking if it is less than 2, then iterating from 2 to the square root of `num` and checking if `num` is divisible by any number in that range. If `num` is not divisible by any number in that range, it is considered prime and the function returns True.
3. Both functions handle non-negative integers and follow the problem description accurately.
4. The program returns the correct count of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number as required by the problem description.
