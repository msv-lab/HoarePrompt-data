According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num` and `num` is not divisible by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `num` must be greater than 3. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `i` becomes 3. 
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `num` must be greater than 3, `num` is not divisible by 3 (`num % i != 0`)**
