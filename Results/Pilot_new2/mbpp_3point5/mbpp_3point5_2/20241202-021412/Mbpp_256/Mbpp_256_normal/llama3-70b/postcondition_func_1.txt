The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and determines if it is a prime number. It returns False if `num` is less than 2 or divisible by 2 without a remainder. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2 and not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`, it returns True.
