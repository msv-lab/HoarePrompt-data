Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`. It first initializes a list `is_prime` with `True` values for indices up to `n`, then it iterates through numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of `n`. For each prime number found, it updates the multiples of that prime number in the `is_prime` list to `False`. Finally, it returns the sum of `True` values in the list, which represents the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

The program is validated against test cases for `func_1(5)`, `func_1(10)`, and `func_1(100)`, and it produces the expected results. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and passes the provided test cases, the correctness of the program can be deemed as **True**.
