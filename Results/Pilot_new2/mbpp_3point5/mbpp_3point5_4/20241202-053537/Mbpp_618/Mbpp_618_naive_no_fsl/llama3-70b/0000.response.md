Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if the two input lists are of the same length. If they are not, it raises a ValueError as expected. If the lists are of the same length, it divides the elements of the two lists element-wise using list comprehension and the zip function, which is the desired behavior according to the problem description. Since the program handles both cases as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
