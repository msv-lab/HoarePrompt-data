Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input and uses list comprehension along with the `zip` function to divide the elements of the two lists element-wise. The provided test cases cover scenarios where the function should work correctly, and in each case, the expected output matches the actual output. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided test cases, the program is correct.
