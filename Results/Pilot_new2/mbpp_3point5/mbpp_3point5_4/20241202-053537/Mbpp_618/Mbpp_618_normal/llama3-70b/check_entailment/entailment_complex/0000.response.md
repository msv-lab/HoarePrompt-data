Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists of numbers of the same length and divides each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list. If the lengths of the input lists are not the same, it correctly raises a ValueError with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description as it performs element-wise division between the two lists and returns the result as a new list.
