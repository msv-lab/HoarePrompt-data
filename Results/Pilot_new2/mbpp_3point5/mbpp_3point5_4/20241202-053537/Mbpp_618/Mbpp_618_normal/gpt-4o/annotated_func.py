#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of equal length containing integers or floating-point numbers.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return [(a / b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a new list that contains the result of dividing each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2. Both list1 and list2 are lists of equal length containing integers or floating-point numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two lists, list1 and list2, both of equal length containing integers or floating-point numbers. It returns a new list that contains the result of dividing each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2.
