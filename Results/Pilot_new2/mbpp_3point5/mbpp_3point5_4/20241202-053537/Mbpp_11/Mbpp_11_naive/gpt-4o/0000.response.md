Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not work correctly for the case where the given character to remove is at the beginning or end of the string and occurs only once. 

For example:
```
assert func_1('world', 'w') == 'orld'
```
In this case, the program should remove the first and last occurrences of 'w' resulting in 'orld', but the program will return 'orldd' as it does not handle these edge cases correctly.
