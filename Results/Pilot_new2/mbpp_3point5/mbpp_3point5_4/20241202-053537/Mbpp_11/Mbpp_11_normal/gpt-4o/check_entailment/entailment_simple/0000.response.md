Correctness: **True**

The program correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string. It first finds the index of the first occurrence of the character using `find()` and the index of the last occurrence using `rfind()`. If the character is not found or if the first and last occurrences are the same, it returns the original string unchanged.

If the character is found at different positions, the program constructs the final string by concatenating the substring before the first occurrence, the substring between the first and last occurrences (excluding both occurrences), and the substring after the last occurrence. This ensures that the first and last occurrences are removed from the original string as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
