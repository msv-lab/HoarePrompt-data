#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.**
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string `s`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. The `first_index` is not -1, `last_index` is not -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns the string `s` with the characters between the first occurrence of `ch` and the last occurrence of `ch` (excluding both occurrences) removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. If the `ch` character is found in the string `s` and occurs more than once, the function returns the original string `s` with the characters between the first and last occurrence of `ch` (excluding both occurrences) removed. If `ch` is not found, or if it occurs only once, the function simply returns the original string `s`.
