Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code aligns with the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` and a single character string `ch` as input. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in the string `s` using the `find` method and the index of the last occurrence using the `rfind` method. If `ch` is found in `s` and occurs more than once, it removes the characters between the first and last occurrence of `ch` (excluding both occurrences) and returns the modified string. If `ch` is not found or occurs only once, it returns the original string `s`. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
