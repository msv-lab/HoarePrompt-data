Example Answer:
`first_occ` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of character `c` in the string `s`. The value of `s` is a string, and the value of `c` is a character. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`**
