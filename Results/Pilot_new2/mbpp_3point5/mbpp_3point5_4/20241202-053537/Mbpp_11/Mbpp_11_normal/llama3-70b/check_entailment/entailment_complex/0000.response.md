Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a string `s` and a character `c`. It correctly finds the first and last occurrences of the character `c` in the string `s` using `s.find(c)` and `s.rfind(c)` respectively. 

If both the first and last occurrences are found (i.e., not equal to -1), it removes the characters between the first and last occurrences of `c` from the string `s` and returns the modified string. If the character `c` is not found in the string `s`, it simply returns the original string.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description by removing the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string.
