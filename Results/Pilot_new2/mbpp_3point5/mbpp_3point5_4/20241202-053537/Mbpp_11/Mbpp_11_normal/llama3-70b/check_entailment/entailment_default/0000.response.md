Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to remove the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string `s`, but it incorrectly removes all occurrences of the character between the first and last occurrences. For example, if `s = "hello world"` and `c = "o"`, the function should return `"hell world"`, but the code will return `"hell wrld"`. The output hints also confirm this discrepancy by stating that the function should return the string with characters between the first and last occurrences of `c` removed, which is not what the code is doing.
