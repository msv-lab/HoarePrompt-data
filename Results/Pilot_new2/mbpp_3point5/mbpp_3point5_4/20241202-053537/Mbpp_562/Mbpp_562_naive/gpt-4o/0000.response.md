Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist and compares its length with the current maximum length. If the length of the current sublist is greater than the current maximum length, it updates the maximum length. The program then returns the maximum length of all sublists. The provided test cases also pass, confirming the correctness of the program.
