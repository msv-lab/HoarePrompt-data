Correctness: **True**

The annotated program accurately describes the function `func_1` which finds the length of the longest sublist in a list of lists. The program iterates through each sublist and updates the `max_length` variable if a sublist with a greater length is encountered. Finally, it returns the length of the longest sublist found.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly identifies the length of the longest sublist in the input `list_of_lists` for every potential case.
