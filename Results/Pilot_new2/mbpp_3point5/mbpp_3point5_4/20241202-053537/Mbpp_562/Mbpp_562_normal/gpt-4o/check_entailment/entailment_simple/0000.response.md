Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the list_of_lists. It iterates through each sublist in the list_of_lists and compares the length of each sublist with the current maximum length. If a sublist has a length greater than the current maximum length, it updates the max_length variable. Finally, it returns the length of the longest sublist found. This implementation follows the problem description as it accurately determines the length of the longest sublist in the list_of_lists.
