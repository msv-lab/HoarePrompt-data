The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements of any data type, and `element`, which is also of any data type. After executing the function body, the program will return True along with the index of the element if it is found in the list `arr`.

If the element is found in the list at index 1, the program will return True along with the value of the index, which is 1.

If the element is found in the list at index 2, the program will return True along with the index, which is equal to 2.

If the element is not found in the list `arr`, the program will return False along with -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and return True along with the index if the element is found in the list. If the element is not found, the function returns False along with -1.
