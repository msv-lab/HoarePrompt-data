Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. It takes in an array (`arr`) and an element (`element`), then iterates through the array using `enumerate` to check if the current value in the array is equal to the given element. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple with True and the index of the element in the array. If no match is found, it returns a tuple with False and -1.

The program covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description, ensuring that it returns the correct boolean value and index position of the element in the array. Therefore, the program is correct.
