Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the list and checks if the element is present. If found, it returns True along with the index of the first occurrence of the element. If the element is not found, it returns False along with -1. The code satisfies the requirements outlined in the problem description and the examples provided. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming its correctness.
