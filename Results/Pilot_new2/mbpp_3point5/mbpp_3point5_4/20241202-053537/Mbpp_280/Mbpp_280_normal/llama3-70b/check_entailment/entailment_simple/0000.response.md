Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in an array `arr` and an element `elem`. It then iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the element `x`. If the element `x` matches the `elem`, it returns a tuple `(True, i)` indicating that the element `elem` is in the array at index `i`.

If the loop finishes without finding the element `elem`, it returns a tuple `(False, -1)` indicating that the element is not in the array.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description by returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if not found) as required.
