Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided in the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes in a list `arr` of elements and an element `elem` to be searched in the list. It then iterates through the list using a for loop and returns True along with the index `i` of the element `elem` if it is found in the list. If the element is not found, the function returns False along with -1 as default values. The function handles the cases where the element is found at the beginning, middle, or end of the list. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the function is correct.
