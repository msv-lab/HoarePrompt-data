Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the function described in the problem description. It takes in a list `arr` and an element `elem` to be searched in the list. It then iterates through the list using a for loop, and if the element `elem` is found, it returns True along with the index `i` where the element is found. If the element is not found, it returns False along with -1 as default values. This behavior matches the requirements of the problem description, making the program correct.
