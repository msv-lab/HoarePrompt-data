According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the elements in the list `arr`. If there are more elements left in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the element to be searched in `arr`, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element in `arr` which is not equal to `elem`. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the list `arr` after the current element, and `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **arr is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, elem is the element to be searched in arr, i is 1, x is the second element in arr**
