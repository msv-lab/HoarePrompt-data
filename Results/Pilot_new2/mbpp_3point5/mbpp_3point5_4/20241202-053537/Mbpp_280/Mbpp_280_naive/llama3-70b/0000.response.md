Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the array using enumerate to get both the index and the element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the program terminates as soon as it finds the element, improving efficiency.
