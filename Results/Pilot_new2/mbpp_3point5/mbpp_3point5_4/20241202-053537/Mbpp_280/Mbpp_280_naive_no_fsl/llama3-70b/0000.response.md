Correctness: True

Explanation: The program iterates through the input array using `enumerate` to keep track of the index. It correctly checks if the element is equal to the current element in the array and returns a tuple with the boolean indicating if the element is found and the index position. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with the boolean indicating it's not found and -1 as the index position. The program covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
