Example Answer:
The binary string `s` is repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times. If the length of `s` does not divide `n`, then the string `s` is repeated one more time to cover the remaining characters. The length of the repeated string `s` will be `len(s) * (n // len(s) + 1)`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times; `n` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **s is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times; `n` is a non-negative integer**
