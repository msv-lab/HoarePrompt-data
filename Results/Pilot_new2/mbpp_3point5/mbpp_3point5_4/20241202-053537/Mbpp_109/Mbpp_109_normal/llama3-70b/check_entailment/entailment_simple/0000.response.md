Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and then rotates the binary string the given number of times. It counts the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating the binary string. The program achieves this by multiplying the input string `s` by the quotient of `n` divided by the length of `s` plus 1 to ensure that the string is long enough to cover all rotations. It then iterates `n` times, slicing the string to get the substring to be considered in each rotation. It counts the number of ones in that substring and adds the result modulo 2 to the count. Finally, it returns the total count of odd valued numbers after all rotations.

The program follows the problem description by accurately counting the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating the binary string the given number of times.
