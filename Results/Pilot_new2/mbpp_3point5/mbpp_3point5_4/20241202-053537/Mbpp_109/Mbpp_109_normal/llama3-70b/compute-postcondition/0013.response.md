The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a binary string, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The program returns the final value of `count` after updating `count` with `temp.count('1') % 2` in each iteration of the loop. This means that the function will iterate through the binary string `s`, count the occurrences of '1' characters in a temporary variable `temp`, and update the `count` variable with the result of `temp.count('1') % 2` in each iteration. The final value of `count` after all iterations will be returned as the output of the function.
Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the final value of `count` after updating it with `temp.count('1') % 2` in each iteration of the loop.**
