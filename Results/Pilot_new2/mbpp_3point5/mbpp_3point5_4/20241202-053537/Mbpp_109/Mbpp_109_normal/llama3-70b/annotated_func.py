#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string and n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a binary string with len(s) > 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated to the value of `count + temp.count('1') % 2` for each valid iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is equal to the last substring of s in the loop
    return count
    #The program returns the final value of count after updating count with `temp.count('1') % 2` in each iteration of the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It then repeats the binary string `s` as necessary to match the length of `n`, calculates the count of occurrences of '1' in each substring of length equal to the length of `s`, and updates the count based on whether the count of '1' in the substring is odd. Finally, the function returns the total count.
