You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string and n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a binary string with len(s) > 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated to the value of `count + temp.count('1') % 2` for each valid iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is equal to the last substring of s in the loop
    return count
    #The program returns the final value of count after updating count with `temp.count('1') % 2` in each iteration of the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It then repeats the binary string `s` as necessary to match the length of `n`, calculates the count of occurrences of '1' in each substring of length equal to the length of `s`, and updates the count based on whether the count of '1' in the substring is odd. Finally, the function returns the total count.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
