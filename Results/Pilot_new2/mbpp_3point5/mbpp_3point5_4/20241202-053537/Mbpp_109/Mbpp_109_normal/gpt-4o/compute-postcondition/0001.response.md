According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of num_rotations. If num_rotations is at least 1, the loop will execute. Additionally, the binary_str being a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's does not directly impact the loop execution. The count being 0 also does not affect the loop execution.
Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are num_rotations must be greater than 0.
State: **binary_str is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, num_rotations must be greater than 0, count is 0**
