Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly rotates the binary string the given number of times and counts the number of times the decimal representation of the rotated binary string is odd. This aligns with the problem description which asks for finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. The program achieves this by rotating the binary string, converting it to decimal, checking if it's odd, and counting the occurrences. The program covers all potential cases and accurately calculates the number of odd numbers after rotation.
