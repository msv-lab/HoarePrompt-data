Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input, rotates the binary string the specified number of times, calculates the decimal value of the rotated string, and increments a count if the decimal value is odd. Finally, it returns the total count of odd values obtained after the rotations. The code covers all the requirements mentioned in the problem description, and based on the provided examples, it appears to be working correctly.
