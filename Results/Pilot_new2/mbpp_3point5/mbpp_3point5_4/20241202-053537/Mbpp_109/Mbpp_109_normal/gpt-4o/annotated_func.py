#State of the program right berfore the function call: binary_str is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and num_rotations is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(binary_str, num_rotations):
    count = 0
    for _ in range(num_rotations):
        binary_str = binary_str[-1] + binary_str[:-1]
        
        integer_value = int(binary_str, 2)
        
        if integer_value % 2 == 1:
            count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: binary_str is the final rotated version after all iterations, num_rotations is the original non-negative integer, count is the number of times integer_value is odd, integer_value is the final decimal representation of the binary string
    return count
    #The program returns the number of times integer_value is odd, which is represented by the variable count
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function func_1 takes two parameters, binary_str (a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's) and num_rotations (a non-negative integer). It then rotates the binary string num_rotations times, calculates the decimal value of the rotated binary string, and increments a count if the decimal value is odd. Finally, it returns the total count of odd values obtained after the rotations. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in this summary.
