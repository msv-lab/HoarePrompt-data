The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. After executing the function body, the program returns False in all cases 1, 2, and 3. In case 4, the program returns True if there is no index `i` such that `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]` in the list `lst` of comparable elements with a length of at least 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` of comparable elements and return True if there is no index where an element is greater than the element next to it in the list. If not, it returns False in all other cases.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns True if there is no index i such that lst[i] is greater than lst[i + 1]. It returns False in all other cases.**
