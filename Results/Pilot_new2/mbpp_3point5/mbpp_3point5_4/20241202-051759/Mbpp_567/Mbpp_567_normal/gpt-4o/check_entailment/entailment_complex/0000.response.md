Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of comparable elements and iterates through the list to check if there exists an index `i` such that `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`. If such an index is found, the function immediately returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any such index, the function returns True, indicating that the list is sorted.

This implementation is correct because it strictly follows the problem description by checking for the sorted order in the list and returning True or False accordingly. The provided annotations also clearly explain the logic and behavior of the function, reinforcing that it meets the requirements of the problem description.
