Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 2. The element at index `i` in `lst` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`. If the element at index `i` in `lst` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, then the function returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made to the list `lst` or the variables `i`.***
