According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than the length of the list `lst` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in `lst` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1. The element at index `i` in `lst` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`**
