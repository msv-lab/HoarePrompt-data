Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False. The program achieves this by using a list comprehension to check if each element is less than or equal to the next element in the list, iterating through the indices of the list.

The program meets the problem description by accurately checking if the specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order, as required. The annotation provided also aligns with the actual implementation of the function. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
