Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` correctly checks whether all the characters in the input string `s` are the same or not. It first checks if the string is empty and returns True in that case. Then it compares the first character with every other character in the string and returns False as soon as it finds a character different from the first character. If all characters are the same, it returns True. The provided test cases also cover different scenarios and the function passes all of them, making it correct.
