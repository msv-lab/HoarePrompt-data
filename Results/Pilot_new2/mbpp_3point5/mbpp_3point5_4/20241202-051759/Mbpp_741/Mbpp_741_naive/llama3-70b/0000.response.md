Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all the characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set (which removes duplicates) and checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. This logic covers all potential cases where the characters are either all the same or not the same in the string, making the program correct.
