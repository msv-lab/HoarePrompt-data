According to the code, since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, the loop can execute again as long as there are more characters left in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string and `char` is equal to `first_char`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still have more characters left to iterate over. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is:
State: **s is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate, first_char is still the first character of string s, char is the next character in string s**
