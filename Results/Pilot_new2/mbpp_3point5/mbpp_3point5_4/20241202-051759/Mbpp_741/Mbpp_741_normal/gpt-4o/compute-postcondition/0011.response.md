According to the code, the loop can execute multiple times depending on the characters in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate, `first_char` is still the first character of string `s`, and `char` is the next character in string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `char` should not be equal to `first_char`.
State: **s is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate, first_char is still the first character of string s, char is the next character in string s that is not equal to first_char**
