#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is a string. s is not empty
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the loop executes, it means all characters in the string s are equal to the first character of s. Therefore, after the loop finishes, s will still be a non-empty string where all characters are equal to first_char. If the loop does not execute, then no action is taken and the values of s and first_char remain the same as the initial state.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string parameter `s` and checks if all characters in the string are the same as the first character. If the string is empty, it returns True. If there is at least one character different from the first character, it returns False. If all characters are the same as the first character, it returns True.
