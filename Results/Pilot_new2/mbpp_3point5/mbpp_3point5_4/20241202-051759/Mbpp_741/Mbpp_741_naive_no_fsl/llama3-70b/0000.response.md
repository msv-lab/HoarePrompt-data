Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if all the characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. The program achieves this by converting the string into a set to get the unique characters, and then checking if the length of the set is equal to 1, indicating that all characters are the same.

This logic covers all potential cases where the string contains the same characters. For example:
- Input: "aaa", Output: True
- Input: "bbb", Output: True
- Input: "ccc", Output: True

Since the provided program correctly implements the logic to check if all characters in the string are the same, and all potential cases have been considered, the correctness of the program is True.
