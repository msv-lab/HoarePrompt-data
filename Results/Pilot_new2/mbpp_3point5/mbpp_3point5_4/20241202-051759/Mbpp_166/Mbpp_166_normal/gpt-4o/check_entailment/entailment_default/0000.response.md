Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program `func_1` correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number as described in the problem statement.
- It calculates the count of pairs of even and odd numbers in the list and returns the sum of these counts, considering pairs of even and odd numbers separately.
- The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the examples provided. The logic of counting pairs of even and odd numbers is implemented correctly, and the output matches the expected results.
