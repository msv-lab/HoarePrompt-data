Correctness: **True**

The provided program counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number by calculating the number of pairs of even numbers and the number of pairs of odd numbers in the list. It then returns the sum of these counts.

This approach correctly follows the problem description as it accurately counts the pairs of integers that xor to an even number. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
