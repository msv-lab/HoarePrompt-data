You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.**
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
    #The program returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs, where even_pairs is the count of pairs of even numbers in the list and odd_pairs is the count of pairs of odd numbers in the list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It calculates the count of pairs of even and odd numbers in the list and returns the sum of these counts. The function considers pairs of even and odd numbers separately. It does not account for pairs that consist of the same number.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
