Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements where `count` has been increased by 3, `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `nums` plus 1, and `count` has been increased by 1. If the XOR operation between the elements at index `i` and `j` results in an even number, `count` is increased by 2.***
