Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `len(nums)`, and `count` has been increased by the total number of valid XOR results. The XOR result between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is an even number***
