Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and counts the number of pairs of integers in the list that XOR to an even number. The program achieves this by iterating over all pairs of integers in the list using two nested loops and checking if the XOR of the pair is even. If it is, the count is incremented.

The program correctly implements the problem description by counting the number of pairs of integers that XOR to an even number. It covers all possible pairs of integers in the list and accurately identifies the ones that fulfill the condition. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
