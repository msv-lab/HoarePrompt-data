Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly iterates through all pairs of integers in the list and checks if their XOR results in an even number. The condition `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0` accurately identifies pairs that XOR to an even number and increments the count accordingly. Since no specific case or input was provided where the program fails to meet the requirements of counting pairs of integers that XOR to an even number, we can conclude that the program is correct.
