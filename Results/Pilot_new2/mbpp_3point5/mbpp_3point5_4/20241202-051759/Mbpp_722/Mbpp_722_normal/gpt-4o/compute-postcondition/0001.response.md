The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names and values are tuples of two floats representing student height and weight. `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary where keys are student names and values are tuples of height and weight for students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter and return a dictionary of students with height greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight greater than or equal to `min_weight` based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It returns a filtered dictionary of students who meet the height and weight requirements.**
