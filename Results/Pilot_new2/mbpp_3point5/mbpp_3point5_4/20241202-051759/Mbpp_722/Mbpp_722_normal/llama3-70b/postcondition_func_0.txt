The function func_1 accepts a dictionary student_data with student names as keys and height-weight tuples as values, along with minimum height and weight criteria. It filters the dictionary based on the condition that student height is greater than or equal to min_height and student weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. The filtered dictionary is then returned.
