The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_data` is a dictionary where keys are student names and values are tuples of floats (student_height, student_weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are tuples of floats (student_height, student_weight) for students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `student_data`, and two floats `min_height` and `min_weight`, and return a filtered dictionary with students meeting the height and weight criteria. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary student_data with student names and their height-weight tuples, along with minimum height and weight criteria. It returns a filtered dictionary with students meeting the height and weight criteria.**
