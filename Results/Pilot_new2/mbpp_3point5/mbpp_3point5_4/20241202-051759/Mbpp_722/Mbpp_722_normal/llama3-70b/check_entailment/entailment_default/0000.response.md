Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_data`, and two minimum values `min_height` and `min_weight`.
- It filters the dictionary based on the condition that student height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and student weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.
- The filtered dictionary is returned as output.
- The code directly aligns with the problem description and there are no edge cases or scenarios where the code would not function as expected. The output hints also accurately reflect the logic of the code, confirming its correctness.
