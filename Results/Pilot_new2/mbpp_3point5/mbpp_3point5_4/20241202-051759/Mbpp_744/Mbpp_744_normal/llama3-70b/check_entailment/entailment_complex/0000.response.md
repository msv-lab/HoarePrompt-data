Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and checks if any element in the tuple is `None` using the `any` function. The program accurately follows the problem description by returning `True` if any element in the tuple is `None`, and `False` otherwise. The annotation provided also clearly explains the purpose and functionality of the function, confirming that it aligns with the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
