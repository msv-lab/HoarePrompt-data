Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple 'tup' and returns True if any element in the tuple is None. Otherwise, it returns False. The code uses the `any()` function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is None. The output hints also align with the code, confirming that it checks for the presence of None values in the tuple. Since the code covers all potential cases as described in the problem, it can be considered correct.
