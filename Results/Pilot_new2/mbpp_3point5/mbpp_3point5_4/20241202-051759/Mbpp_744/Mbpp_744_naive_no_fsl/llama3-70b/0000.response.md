Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program uses the any() function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is None. This implementation correctly follows the problem description and should work for all cases where the input is a tuple. There are no edge cases or potential inputs mentioned in the problem description that would cause the program to behave incorrectly.
