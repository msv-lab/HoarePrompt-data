Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second list has the second element. The program uses list comprehension to achieve this and there are no edge cases or scenarios where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description.
