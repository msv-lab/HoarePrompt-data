Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program attempts to create two separate lists, one containing the first elements of each sublist and the other containing the second elements. However, the way the program is written will not produce the desired output. 

The issue lies in the list comprehension used to create the two lists. The list comprehension syntax used in the program will not produce the expected output, as it is trying to create a list with a generator expression inside it. 

To correct the program, the list comprehension should be used directly to extract the first and second elements of each sublist.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    first_elements = [element[0] for element in list_of_lists]
    second_elements = [element[1] for element in list_of_lists]
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
```

This corrected version will correctly separate the first and second elements of each sublist into two separate lists, as specified in the problem description.
