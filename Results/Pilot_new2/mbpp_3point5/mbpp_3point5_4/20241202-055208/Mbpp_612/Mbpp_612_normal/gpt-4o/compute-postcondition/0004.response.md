Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list where each element is a sublist with exactly two elements. It then extracts the first and second elements of each sublist and returns two lists, first_elements and second_elements, respectively. The function correctly implements the extraction process as described by the annotations. No missing functionality or edge cases are identified in this context. **
