Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, extracts the first and second elements of each sublist, and returns a list of two lists with the first list containing the first elements and the second list containing the second elements. The annotations in the code confirm that the program is doing exactly what the problem description asks for.
