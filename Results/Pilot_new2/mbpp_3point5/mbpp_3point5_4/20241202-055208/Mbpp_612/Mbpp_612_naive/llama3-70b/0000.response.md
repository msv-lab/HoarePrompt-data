Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, and correctly returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program iterates through each sublist in the `list_of_lists`, extracts the first and second elements of each sublist using list comprehension, and returns the desired output. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, it is considered correct.
