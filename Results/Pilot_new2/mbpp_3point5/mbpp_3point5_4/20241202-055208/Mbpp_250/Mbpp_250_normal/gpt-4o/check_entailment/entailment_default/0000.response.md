Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple and straightforward implementation of the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, then returns the count of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`. The code uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which accurately determines the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`. Since the code aligns perfectly with the problem description and there are no edge cases mentioned in the description or the output hints that could potentially cause the code to fail, the correctness of the code is considered true.
