Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description, as it accurately counts the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. Testing the function with different tuples and elements confirms that it works correctly for all cases. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
