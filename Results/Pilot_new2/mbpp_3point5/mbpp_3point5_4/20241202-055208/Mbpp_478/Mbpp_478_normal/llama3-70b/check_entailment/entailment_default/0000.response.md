Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase letters from the original string `s`, as per the problem description.
- The code uses a generator expression within `join()` to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, checking if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method, and only including uppercase characters in the final output string.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the output hints also agree with the code functionality. The provided code aligns with the problem description to remove lowercase substrings from the input string and return a new string containing only uppercase letters.
