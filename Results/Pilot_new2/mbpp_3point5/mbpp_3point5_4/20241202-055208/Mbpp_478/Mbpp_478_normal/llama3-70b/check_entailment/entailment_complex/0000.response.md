Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase letters from the original string `s. This aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Since the function only keeps uppercase letters and removes lowercase letters, it effectively achieves the goal of removing lowercase substrings from the input string. Therefore, the program is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description.
