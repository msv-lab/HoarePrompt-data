Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string consisting of only the uppercase letters from the original string `s`. The function achieves this by filtering out the lowercase letters using a list comprehension. 

Upon analyzing the code and the problem description, it is evident that the function correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function does exactly what is required, which is to remove lowercase substrings from the input string and return the remaining uppercase letters. 

There are no edge cases or scenarios identified where the code would fail to deliver the expected output. Additionally, the output hints align with the code's functionality, further confirming that the code is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the code is determined to be **True**.
