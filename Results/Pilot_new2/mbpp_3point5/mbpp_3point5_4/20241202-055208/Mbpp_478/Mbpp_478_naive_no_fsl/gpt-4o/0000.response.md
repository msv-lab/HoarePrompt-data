Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters. The program uses list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string and includes it in the output string only if it is uppercase. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and the program works as expected for all of them. Hence, the program is correct.
