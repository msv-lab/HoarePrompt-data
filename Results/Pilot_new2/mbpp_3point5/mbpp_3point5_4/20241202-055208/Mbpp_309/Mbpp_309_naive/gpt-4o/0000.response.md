Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers as input and returns the maximum of the two numbers. The function uses a ternary operator to compare the two numbers and returns the greater number. The function then has three `assert` statements that test the function with different input values. 

For the provided test cases:
- `assert func_1(5, 10) == 10` - This checks if the function correctly returns 10 when given 5 and 10 as inputs, which is expected.
- `assert func_1(-1, -2) == -1` - This checks if the function correctly returns -1 when given -1 and -2 as inputs, which is expected.
- `assert func_1(9, 7) == 9` - This checks if the function correctly returns 9 when given 9 and 7 as inputs, which is expected.

The program meets the requirements of finding the maximum of two numbers in all the provided test cases.
