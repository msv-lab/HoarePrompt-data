Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the maximum value between them using the `max()` function provided by Python. This directly aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to find the maximum of two numbers. Therefore, the program is correct as it fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description.
