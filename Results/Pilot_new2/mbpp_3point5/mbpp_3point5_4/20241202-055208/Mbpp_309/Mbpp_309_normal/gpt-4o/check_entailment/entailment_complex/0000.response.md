Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the larger of the two integers using a conditional expression. The program follows the problem description as it correctly finds the maximum of two numbers by returning `a` if `a` is greater than `b`, and `b` otherwise. This logic covers all potential cases and accurately implements the requirements of the problem description.
