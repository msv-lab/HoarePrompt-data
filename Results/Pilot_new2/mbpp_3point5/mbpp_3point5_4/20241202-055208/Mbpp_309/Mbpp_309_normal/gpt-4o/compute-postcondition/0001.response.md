The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the larger of the two integers `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and return the larger of the two integers.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the larger of the two integers.**
