Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and correctly returns its absolute value and phase, which aligns with the problem description of converting complex numbers to polar coordinates. The function uses the `abs` function to calculate the absolute value and the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase of the complex number, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
