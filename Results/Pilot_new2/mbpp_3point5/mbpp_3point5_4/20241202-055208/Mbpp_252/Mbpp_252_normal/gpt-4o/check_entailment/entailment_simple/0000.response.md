Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number as input and uses the `cmath.polar` function to convert the complex number to its polar coordinates. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a Python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. Therefore, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description and is correct.
