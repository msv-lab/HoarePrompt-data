Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input. It then returns a new list that contains all elements from the list `lst` followed by all elements from the tuple `tpl`. This exactly matches the problem description, as the function is adding the elements of the tuple to the list.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and returns the expected output.
