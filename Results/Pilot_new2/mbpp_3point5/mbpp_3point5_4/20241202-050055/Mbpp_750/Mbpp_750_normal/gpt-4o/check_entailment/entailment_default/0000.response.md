Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in the program correctly implements the function `func_1` as per the problem description. The function takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then returns a new list that contains all elements from the list followed by all elements from the tuple. The code simply concatenates the list and the tuple by converting the tuple to a list using the `list()` function and using the `+` operator to concatenate the two lists. 

There are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where the code does not follow the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code and support the fact that the function is correctly implemented to add the given tuple to the given list.
