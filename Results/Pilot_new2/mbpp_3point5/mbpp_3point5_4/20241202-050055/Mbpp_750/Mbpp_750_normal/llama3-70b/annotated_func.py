#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tup is a tuple.**
def func_1(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
    #The program returns the concatenation of list `lst` and the elements of tuple `tup` converted to a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, then returns the concatenation of the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tup` converted to a list. There are no edge cases or missing functionality in this simple concatenation operation.
