Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns the concatenation of the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tup` converted to a list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to add the given tuple to the given list. The code provided effectively accomplishes this task by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the original list. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
