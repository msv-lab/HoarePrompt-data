Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where `n` is less than 5. The problem description states that if `n` is less than 5, the function should not provide a valid output, but the code does not explicitly handle this scenario. This means that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Additionally, the output hints suggest that if `n` is at least 5, the function should correctly calculate the factorial of `n` and return the last digit of the factorial. However, the code does not follow this description accurately as well, since it simply returns 0 for any `n` greater than or equal to 5, instead of calculating the factorial and returning the last digit.

Therefore, based on the discrepancies between the problem description, the code, and the output hints, the correctness of the code is **False**.
