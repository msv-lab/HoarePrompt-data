#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n >= 5) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 if the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 5
    else :
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is at least 5, `factorial` is the factorial of `n`, `i` is 5
        return factorial % 10
        #The program returns the last digit of the factorial of `n` where `n` is at least 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
- If the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0.
- If `n` is at least 5, the function correctly calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial.
- However, there is a missing edge case handling for the scenario where `n` is less than 5 since the code does not explicitly handle this case. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function should be clarified to state that if `n` is less than 5, the function does not provide a valid output.
