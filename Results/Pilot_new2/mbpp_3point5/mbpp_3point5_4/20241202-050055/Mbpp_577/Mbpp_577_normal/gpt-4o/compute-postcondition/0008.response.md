According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `factorial` is the product of all numbers from 1 to 2 multiplied by 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3, `factorial` should be updated to include the product of all numbers from 1 to 3, and `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `factorial` is the product of all numbers from 1 to 3 multiplied by 2, `i` is 3**
