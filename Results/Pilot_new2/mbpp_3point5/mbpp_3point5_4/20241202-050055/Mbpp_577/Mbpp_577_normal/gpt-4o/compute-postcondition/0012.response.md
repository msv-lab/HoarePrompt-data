The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 
- If the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0.
- If `n` is at least 5, the function returns the last digit of the factorial of `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `n` is at least 5, the function returns the last digit of the factorial of `n`.
