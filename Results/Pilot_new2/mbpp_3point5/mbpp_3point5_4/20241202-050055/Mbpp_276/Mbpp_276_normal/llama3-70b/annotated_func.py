#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are positive numbers.**
def func_1(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns the volume of a cylinder, which is calculated by multiplying pi, the square of the radius, and the height. Both radius and height are positive numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive numbers, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the provided radius and height, and returns the calculated volume.
