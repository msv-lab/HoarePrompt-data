The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are both positive numbers. The function calculates the volume of a cylinder by multiplying pi, the square of the radius, and the height. The program then returns this calculated volume. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive numbers, calculate the volume of a cylinder using the provided radius and height, and return the calculated volume as the output.
