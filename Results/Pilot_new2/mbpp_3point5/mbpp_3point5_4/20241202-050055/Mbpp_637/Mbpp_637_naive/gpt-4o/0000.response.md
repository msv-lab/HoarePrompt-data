Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given function `func_1` checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. The logic is correct as it correctly returns True if the cost price is equal to the selling price, and False otherwise. The provided test cases cover all potential cases such as no profit, no loss, and scenarios where there is profit or loss. Since the function passes all the test cases and meets the requirements of the problem description, the correctness is true.
