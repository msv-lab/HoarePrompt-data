Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` which takes two non-negative integer parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price`. It then checks if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price` and returns True if they are equal, False otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss, which essentially means checking if the cost price is equal to the selling price. Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the requirements of the problem description.
