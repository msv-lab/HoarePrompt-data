The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, which are non-negative integers. After executing the function body, the program returns whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price` or not. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-negative integer parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and return whether they are equal or not.
