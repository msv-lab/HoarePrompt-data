Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. This aligns with the problem description of checking for no profit and no loss. If the cost price is equal to the selling price, it means there is neither profit nor loss, which satisfies the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
