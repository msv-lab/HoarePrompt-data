Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code checks whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price` and returns True if they are equal, otherwise, it returns False. This aligns with the problem description that states the function should return True if there is no profit or loss, which happens when the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. The code correctly handles all non-negative integer cases as specified. Also, since the problem description does not mention negative integers, the code is not required to handle them, making it correct.
