Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two non-negative integer parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price` and returns True if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, indicating that there is no profit or loss. The program directly addresses the problem description by checking for equality between the cost price and selling price, which aligns with the requirements of the problem. Additionally, the comments in the code provide clear explanations of the functionality of the function.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
