Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given number. 
For `n` less than or equal to 2, the function correctly returns 0. For larger values of `n`, the code generates a list `is_prime` where each element represents whether the index is a prime number or not. It then marks composite numbers as False and prime numbers as True. Finally, the function returns the sum of the boolean values in the list `is_prime`, excluding the first two elements.

The code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to the given number `n`, ensuring that the count of prime numbers less than `n` is accurately calculated. The code also correctly handles the edge cases by returning 0 for `n` values less than or equal to 2.

The output hints also align with the code's functionality, further confirming its correctness. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code, demonstrating that it fulfills the requirements for all potential cases.
