According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n`, `i * i` is less than `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value in the range specified by the for loop statement.
State: **n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is 2, i * i is less than n, and j is updated to the next value in the range(i * i, n, i)**
