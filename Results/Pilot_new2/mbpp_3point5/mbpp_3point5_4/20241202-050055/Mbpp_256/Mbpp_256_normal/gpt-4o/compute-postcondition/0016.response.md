According to the code, the loop can execute until j reaches n. Therefore, to execute one more time, the value of j needs to be adjusted. In this case, j should be incremented by i, making j equal to i * i + i for the next iteration. Additionally, i should be incremented by 1 to move to the next value. 
State: *n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is 3, i * i is less than n, and j is initialized to i * i + i. After the execution of the if block, all elements in the range(i * i, n, i) have been updated to False in is_prime if is_prime[i] is true.
