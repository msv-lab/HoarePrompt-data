According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of `[i * i, n)` and increments by `i` in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` list has `is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False` and all other elements are `True`, `i` is at least 3, `j` is equal to `i * i`, and `is_prime[j]` is `False`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be updated to the next value in the range `[i * i, n)` that satisfies the loop condition.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values where `is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False` and all other elements are `True`, `i` is at least 3, `j` is the next value after `i * i` in the range `[i * i, n)` where `is_prime[j]` is `False**`.
