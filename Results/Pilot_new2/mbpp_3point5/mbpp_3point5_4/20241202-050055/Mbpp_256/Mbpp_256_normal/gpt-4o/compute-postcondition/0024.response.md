According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values, is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is 3, i * i is less than n, and j is initialized to i * i. 

For the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be updated to the next value and j needs to be recalculated based on the updated value of i.
State: **n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values, is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is the next value after 3, i * i is less than n, and j is initialized to the new value of i * i**
