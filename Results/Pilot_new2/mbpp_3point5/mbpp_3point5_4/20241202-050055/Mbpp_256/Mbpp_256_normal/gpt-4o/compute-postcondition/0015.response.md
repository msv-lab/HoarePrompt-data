According to the code, the loop should execute until i is equal to int(n ** 0.5) + 1. At the end of the last iteration, n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is 2, i * i is less than n, and j is initialized to i * i. After the execution of the if block, all elements in the range(i * i, n, i) have been updated to False in is_prime if is_prime[i] is true.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: *n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is 3, i * i is less than n, and j is initialized to i * i. After the execution of the if block, all elements in the range(i * i, n, i) have been updated to False in is_prime if is_prime[i] is true.
