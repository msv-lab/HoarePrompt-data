According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `j in range(i * i, n, i)` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values where `is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False` and all other elements are `True`, `i` is at least 3, `j` is the next value after `i * i` in the range `[i * i, n)` where `is_prime[j]` is `False. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the next value after the current `j` in the range `[i * i, n)` where `is_prime[j]` is `False.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values where `is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False` and all other elements are `True`, `i` is at least 3, `j` is the next value after the current `j` in the range `[i * i, n)` where `is_prime[j]` is `False**
