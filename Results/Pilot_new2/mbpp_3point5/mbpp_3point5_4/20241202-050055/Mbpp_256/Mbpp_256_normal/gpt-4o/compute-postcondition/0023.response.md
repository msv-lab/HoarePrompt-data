Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True. After the execution of the if block, all elements in the range(i * i, n, i) have been updated to False in is_prime if is_prime[i] is true. If is_prime[i] is True, then all elements in the range(i * i, n, i) will be updated to False in is_prime. i is 3, i * i is less than n, and j is initialized to i * i.***
