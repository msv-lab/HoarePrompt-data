According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. Since `num` needs to be a non-negative integer larger than or equal to 2, we need to adjust the state to ensure this condition is met. Additionally, the loop range starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of `num` (exclusive). Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `num` is a non-negative integer larger than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2 at the start of the loop.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer larger than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
