Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not handle the case when the input number `n` is less than 2. The problem description specifies that the function should return the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. However, the code does not include a check for when `n` is less than 2, which means it will not behave as expected for inputs like 0 or 1. This means the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
