Output State: **If the loop executes, then `num` is a prime number, as it is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`. If the loop does not execute, then `num` is a prime number as well, since the condition for the loop to execute is that `num` is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`.**
