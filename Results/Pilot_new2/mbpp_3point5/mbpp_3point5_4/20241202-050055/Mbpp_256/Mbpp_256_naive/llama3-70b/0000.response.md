Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a nested function `is_prime(num)` that checks if a number is prime. It then iterates over all numbers from 2 to n (excluding n) and counts the prime numbers. The logic for checking if a number is prime seems correct as it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number. The iteration over all numbers from 2 to n seems to cover all prime numbers less than the given number n. Therefore, the program appears to correctly count the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
