Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input, converts them into sets, calculates the symmetric difference between the two sets, converts the result back into a list, and then sorts the list based on the index in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. This process accurately computes the difference between two lists as described in the problem description. The function always returns the correct result for any given input lists.
