Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function that takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and correctly implements the logic to get the difference between the two lists as described in the problem description. 

1. It creates sets `set1` and `set2` from `list1` and `list2` respectively to get unique elements.
2. It then finds the symmetric difference between the two sets using `symmetric_difference`.
3. The resulting elements are converted to a list `result_list`.
4. The elements in `result_list` are sorted based on their index in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`.
5. Finally, the function returns the sorted list of different elements.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
