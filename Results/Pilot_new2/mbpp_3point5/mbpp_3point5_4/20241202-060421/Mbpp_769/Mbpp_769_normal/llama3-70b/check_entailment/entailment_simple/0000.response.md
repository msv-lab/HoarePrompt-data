Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by using the XOR operator (^) on the sets created from the input lists to get the symmetric difference (elements present in either list1 or list2, but not in both). It then converts the result back to a list, sorts it, and returns the sorted list of unique elements that meet the criteria specified in the problem description. This implementation ensures that the program always returns the correct difference between two lists.
