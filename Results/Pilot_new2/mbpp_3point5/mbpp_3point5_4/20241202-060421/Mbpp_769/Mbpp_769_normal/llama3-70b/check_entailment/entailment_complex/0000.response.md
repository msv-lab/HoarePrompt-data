Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the difference between two lists by finding the symmetric difference using set operations. It then sorts the result to return a list of unique elements present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. The annotations provided in the code also explain the purpose of the function and how it achieves the desired outcome. Since the program consistently performs this operation for any input lists, it can be considered correct.
