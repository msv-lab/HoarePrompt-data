Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and recursively flattens the nested list to create a flat list that contains all the elements of the nested list in a flat structure. The function correctly handles nested lists of any depth by checking if each element in the list is itself a list. If it is a list, the function recursively calls itself on that sublist to flatten it. If it is not a list, the element is directly appended to the flat list. The function returns the flat list at the end.

All the provided test cases pass successfully, and the code aligns with the problem description by correctly flattening nested lists into a single flat list. Additionally, the output hints also support the code's correctness by describing the function's behavior of recursively flattening nested lists to produce a flat list containing all elements. Therefore, based on the information provided, the code is correct.
