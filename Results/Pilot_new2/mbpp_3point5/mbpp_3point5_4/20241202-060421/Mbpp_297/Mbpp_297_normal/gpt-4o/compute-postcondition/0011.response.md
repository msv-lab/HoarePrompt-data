According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more items in the nested_list, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 2 items. For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 3 items, flat_list is updated based on the conditions specified. If item is a list, flat_list is updated with the result of func_1(item) for each item in nested_list. Otherwise, flat_list is updated with the next item from nested_list.**
