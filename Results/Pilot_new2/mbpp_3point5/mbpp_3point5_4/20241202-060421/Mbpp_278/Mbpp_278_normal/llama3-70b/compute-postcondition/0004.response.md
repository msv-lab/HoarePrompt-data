According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the tuple `tup`. In this case, the loop will execute one more time if there is at least one more element in the tuple after the current `elem`. 
At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the tuple. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least 2 elements in the tuple, and the `elem` should now be the second element in the tuple.
State: **`tup` is a tuple that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the tuple**
