Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string as input and converts it to uppercase using the `upper()` method. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description, as the requirement is to convert a given string to uppercase, and the `upper()` method achieves this. Additionally, the `upper()` method is a built-in method in Python that handles all characters and special cases, ensuring that the conversion to uppercase is accurate for any input string. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
