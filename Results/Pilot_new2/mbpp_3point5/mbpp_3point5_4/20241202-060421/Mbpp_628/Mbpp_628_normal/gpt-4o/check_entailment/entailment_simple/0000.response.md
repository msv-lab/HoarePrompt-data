Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the annotated code correctly replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20', as specified in the problem description. The use of the replace() function ensures that every space character in the input string is replaced with '%20'. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
