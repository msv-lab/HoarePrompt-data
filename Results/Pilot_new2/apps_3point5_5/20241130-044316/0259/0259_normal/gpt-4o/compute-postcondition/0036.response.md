Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time` are updated variables where `n` must be greater than the current `i + 1`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is updated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` becomes equal to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`.***
