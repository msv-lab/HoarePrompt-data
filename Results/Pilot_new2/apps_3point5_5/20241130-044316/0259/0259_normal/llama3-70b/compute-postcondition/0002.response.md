According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop will definitely execute. The empty list `buses` will be appended with some values during the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer, buses is an empty list**
