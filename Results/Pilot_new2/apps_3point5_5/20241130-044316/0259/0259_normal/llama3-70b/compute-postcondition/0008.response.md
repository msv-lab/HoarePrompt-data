According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **Output State: n is a positive integer between 3 and 100, t is a positive integer, buses contains a tuple (s, d) where s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input, and a new tuple (s, d) has been appended to buses.**
