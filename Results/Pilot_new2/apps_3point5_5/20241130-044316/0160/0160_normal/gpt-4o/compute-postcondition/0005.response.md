Postcondition: ***N, K, A_i, x, i are integers. If x is divisible by i, divisors is a set containing all values of i from 1 to the current value of i and divisors contains x divided by all integers from 1 to the previous value of i. Otherwise, divisors contains all values of i from 1 to the previous value of i.***
