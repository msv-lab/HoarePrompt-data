The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it uses the integer `n` and the list `a` as defined within the function. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. The function performs some operations based on the values in the list `a` and potentially modifies the list. The return value of the function depends on the specific operations performed on the list `a`.
