Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by taking the input, finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, calculating the distances in all possible scenarios, and then outputting the maximum distance. Since the logic is implemented correctly and the examples provided match the expected output, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
