The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the program returns the result of `n` multiplied by `10` raised to the power of `k` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `10` raised to the power of `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return the result of the calculation described above. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer. It returns the result of n multiplied by 10 raised to the power of k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10 raised to the power of k.**
