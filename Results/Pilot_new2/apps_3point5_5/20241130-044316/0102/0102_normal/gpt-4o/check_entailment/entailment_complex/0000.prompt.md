You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

You can find all you need to know about English numerals in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_numerals .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99.**
def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven',
    'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen',
    'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy',
    'eighty', 'ninety']
    if (0 <= n <= 9) :
        return ones[n]
        #The program returns the string representation of the single-digit number at index n in the list 'ones'
    else :
        if (11 <= n <= 19) :
            return teens[n - 10]
            #The program returns the string representation of the number n from the 'teens' list, where n is between 11 and 19
        else :
            if (10 <= n <= 99) :
                if (n % 10 == 0) :
                    return tens[n // 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of the tens place digit of the integer n
                else :
                    return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
                    #The program returns the string representation of n where the tens place is obtained from the 'tens' list and the ones place is obtained from the 'ones' list with a hyphen in between
            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones is a list containing the string representations of single-digit numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list containing the string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen; tens is a list containing the string representations of numbers from ten to ninety. n is not in the range of 11 to 19, n is not in the range of 10 to 99
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones is a list containing the string representations of single-digit numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list containing the string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen; tens is a list containing the string representations of numbers from ten to ninety. n is not in the range of 11 to 19, n is not in the range of 10 to 99
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 99; ones is a list containing the string representations of single-digit numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list containing the string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen; tens is a list containing the string representations of numbers from ten to ninety. n is not in the range of 11 to 19, n is not in the range of 10 to 99
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` in the range of 0 to 99. It then returns the string representation of `n` based on the following cases:
- Case 1: If `n` corresponds to a single-digit number, it returns the string representation from the 'ones' list.
- Case 2: If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation from the 'teens' list.
- Case 3: If `n` represents a number in the tens place, it returns the string representation of the tens place digit.
- Case 4: If `n` is a two-digit number, it returns the string representation where the tens place is obtained from the 'tens' list and the ones place is obtained from the 'ones' list, separated by a hyphen.
The functionality does not cover cases where `n` is outside the specified range, and additional logic could be added to handle such scenarios.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
