Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It ensures that the number of apples and pears are in the required ratio of 2:4 when compared to lemons. The code calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits Nikolay can use and then multiplies each type of fruit by their respective ratios to get the total number of fruits for the compote. The logic seems correct for all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately.
