Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given ratios. It first calculates the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use based on the limiting factor (minimum of available lemons, apples divided by 2, and pears divided by 4). Then, it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum lemons by 1, apples by 2, and pears by 4, and prints the result.

The program follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases and returns the correct output.
