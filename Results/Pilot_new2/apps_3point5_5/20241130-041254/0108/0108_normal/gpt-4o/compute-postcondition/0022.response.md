Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is either 26 or less. If `j` is 26, then `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`. If `j` is less than 26 and `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is not equal to 26. `i` is incremented by 1 until `i` is equal to the length of `s`.***
