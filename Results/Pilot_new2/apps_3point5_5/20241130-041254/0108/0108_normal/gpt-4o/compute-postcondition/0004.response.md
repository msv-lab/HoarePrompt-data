According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string `target` (which is 26), the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, both `i` needs to be less than the length of string `s` and `j` needs to be less than 26. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, and `j` must be less than 26**
