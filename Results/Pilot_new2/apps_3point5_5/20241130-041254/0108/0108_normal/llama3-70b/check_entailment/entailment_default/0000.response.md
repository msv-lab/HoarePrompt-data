Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes in a string `s` and iterates over the English alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces occurrences of that character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If the character is not present in `s`, it moves on to the next character in the alphabet. Finally, it prints the concatenated characters from the processed alphabet.

The code correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that each character in the English alphabet is present in the final output string `res` and in alphabetical order. If all characters are processed (length of `res` is 26), it prints the concatenated alphabet. If not all characters are processed, it correctly prints -1. The code is following the problem description for every potential case.
