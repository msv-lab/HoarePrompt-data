Correctness: **True**

The program takes an input string `s` and iterates through the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces occurrences of that character in the input string `s` with the next character in alphabetical order. It keeps track of the characters it has successfully replaced in the `res` string. 

After processing all characters in the alphabet, if the length of `res` is 26 (indicating that all characters in the alphabet have been found in the input string), it prints out `res`, which would contain the alphabet in order. Otherwise, if the length of `res` is not 26, it prints -1.

This program correctly follows the problem description as it replaces characters in the input string to obtain the alphabet as a subsequence. If it is not possible to obtain the alphabet as a subsequence from the input string, it correctly prints -1.
