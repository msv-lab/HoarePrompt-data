The function `func` reads a string `s`, processes each character in the alphabet and replaces occurrences of that character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If a character is not present in `s`, it moves to the next character in the alphabet. The function then prints the concatenated characters from the alphabet processed in order. If all characters are processed (length of `res` is 26), it prints the concatenated alphabet. If not all characters are processed, it prints -1.
