According to the code, the loop can execute if the character `char` is found in the string `s`. Right before the loop, `s` has no occurrence of any character from the initial `alphabet`, `alphabet` is empty, `res` contains all the characters processed so far, `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string, and loop control variable `char` is not found in the string `s`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the loop control variable `char` must be found in the string `s`.
State: **`s` has no occurrence of any character from the initial `alphabet`, `alphabet` is empty, `res` contains all the characters processed so far, `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string, and loop control variable `char` is found in the string `s`**
