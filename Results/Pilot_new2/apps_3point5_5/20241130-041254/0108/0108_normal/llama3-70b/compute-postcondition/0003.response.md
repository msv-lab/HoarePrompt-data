According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `alphabet` string. As long as there are characters in the `alphabet` string, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `s` string is assigned the value of the input string. In order for the loop to execute, `alphabet` must have characters remaining, `res` must be updated with the characters processed so far, and `char` must be the next character in the `alphabet` string.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `s` is assigned the value of the input string, `alphabet` has characters remaining, `res` is updated with the characters processed so far, `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string**
