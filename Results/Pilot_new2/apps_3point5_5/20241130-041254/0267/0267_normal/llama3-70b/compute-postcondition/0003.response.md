Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, dp is a dictionary to store computed values. k is not equal to 0. If (n, k) is a key in the dp dictionary, then the current state of the program variables is such that the pair (n, k) is found in the dp dictionary.***
