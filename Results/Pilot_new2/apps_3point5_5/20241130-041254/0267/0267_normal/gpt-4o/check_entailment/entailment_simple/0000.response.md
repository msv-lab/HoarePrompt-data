Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. 

1. `func_1(n, k)` correctly checks if the number of unique digits in the integer `n` is less than or equal to `k`.
2. `func_2(l, r, k)` correctly iterates over all numbers in the range `[l, r]` and checks if each number satisfies the condition of having at most `k` different digits using `func_1`. It then calculates the total sum of such numbers modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the program accurately calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, as stated in the problem description.
