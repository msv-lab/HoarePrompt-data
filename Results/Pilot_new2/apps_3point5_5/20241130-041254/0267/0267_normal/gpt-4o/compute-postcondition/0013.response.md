The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the program returns the updated total sum (modulo MOD) based on the conditions of func_1(num, k) for all numbers in the range (l, r + 1) or 0 if func_1(num, k) is false for any number. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept integers l, r, and k within the specified constraints and calculate the updated total sum based on the conditions of func_1(num, k) for all numbers in the range (l, r + 1), returning 0 if func_1(num, k) is false for any number.
