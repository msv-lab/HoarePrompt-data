Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$. The function `count` calculates the count of valid numbers for a given range and number of different digits, and the main function `func_1` correctly calculates the final result by subtracting the count for $l-1$ from the count for $r$. The modulo operation is also applied correctly. 

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, including the constraints on the inputs. The logic provided in the program is sound and should work for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
