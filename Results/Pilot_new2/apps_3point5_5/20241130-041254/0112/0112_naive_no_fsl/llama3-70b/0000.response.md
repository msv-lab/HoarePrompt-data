Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. The program simply considers all digits available on the cubes and sorts them in descending order to form the maximum number. This approach does not consider the specific condition mentioned in the problem description, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. 

For example, consider the following input:
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

The correct output should be 87, as Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87. However, the program will output 98, as it does not handle the restriction of not being able to make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description in every potential case.
