Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in the number of cubes Masha has and the digits on each face of the cubes. It then iterates through all possible numbers from 1 until it can no longer form the number using the available cubes. This logic covers all potential cases where Masha can form numbers from 1 to x using her cubes. The program correctly implements the problem description and passes all test cases.
