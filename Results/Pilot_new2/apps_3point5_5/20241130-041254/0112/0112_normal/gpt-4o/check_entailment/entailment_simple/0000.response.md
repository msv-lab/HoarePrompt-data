Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. 

- The `func_1` function iterates over numbers starting from 1 and checks if Masha can form that number using the cubes she has. This is done by calling the `can_form_number` function.
- The `can_form_number` function takes a number as input, converts it to a list of digits, and checks if each digit can be formed using the cube faces. It keeps track of which cubes have been used to form the number.
- The program correctly determines the maximum number that Masha can form using her cubes.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and returns the expected output for all potential cases.
