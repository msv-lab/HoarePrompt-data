According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is True, `used_cubes` is a list where at least one element is True and `used_cubes[i]` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, there are more digits left in the `digits` list, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`found` is True, `used_cubes` is a list where at least one element is True and `used_cubes[i]` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, there are more digits left in the `digits` list**
