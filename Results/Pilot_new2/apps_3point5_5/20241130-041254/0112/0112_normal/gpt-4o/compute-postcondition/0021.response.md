Postcondition: ***After the loop finishes executing, all elements in used_cubes that correspond to a cube face containing the first digit in the list of digits will be set to True. If at least one such element is set to True, found will be True. Otherwise, found will remain False. Additionally, when the if condition is met (not found), the state of the program will be such that found is still False and the corresponding elements in used_cubes remain unchanged.***
