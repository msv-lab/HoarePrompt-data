Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `used_cubes` is a list where all elements are True, `i` is equal to n-1, `n` is a positive integer, there are no more digits left in the `digits` list. If the condition (not found) is true, then the program state is such that `found` is False and all other variables remain unchanged.***
