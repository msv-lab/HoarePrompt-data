According to the code, the loop can execute if there are digits in the list `digits`. The loop will iterate through each digit in the list. Before the loop starts, `num` being a non-negative integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `digits` is not empty and `digit` is the first element in the list. Additionally, all elements in the `used_cubes` list must be set to False.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of num that is not empty, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to False, `digit` is the first digit in the list of `digits`**
