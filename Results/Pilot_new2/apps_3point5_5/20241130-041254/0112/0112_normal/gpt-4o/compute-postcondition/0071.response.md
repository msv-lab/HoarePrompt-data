Functionality: **The function `can_form_number` takes a non-negative integer `num` as input, which represents the maximum number that Masha can form using her cubes. It then iterates through the digits of `num`, checking if each digit can be formed using the available cube faces. If any digit cannot be formed, the function returns False. If all digits can be formed, it returns True. The function includes multiple return cases for different scenarios, ensuring that Masha's ability to form the number is accurately determined based on the cube faces available.**
