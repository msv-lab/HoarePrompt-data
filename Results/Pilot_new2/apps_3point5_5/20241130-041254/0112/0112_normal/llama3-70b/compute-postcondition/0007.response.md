According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If there are still more sublists in the `cubes` list, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list containing more than `n` sublists, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in each cube. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more sublist in the `cubes` list.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list containing more than `n+1` sublists, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in each cube**
