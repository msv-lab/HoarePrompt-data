Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program correctly determines whether Vasya's favorite number exists in the sequence based on the first element and the difference between neighboring elements. The conditions in the if-elif-else block cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The program checks if the favorite number is equal to the first element, if the difference between the favorite number and the first element is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements, and if the calculated index for the favorite number is non-negative. Therefore, the program is correct as it handles all cases specified in the problem description.
