Correctness: **True**

The program accurately follows the problem description. It reads three integers a, b, and c, and checks if b appears in the sequence starting from a with a difference of c between elements. If b is equal to a, it prints 'YES' as b is the first element of the sequence. If c is 0 and b is not equal to a, it prints 'NO' as the elements will not change. If c is not 0, it calculates if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This logic correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
