Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads three integers a, b, and c, and checks if b equals a. If b is equal to a, it prints 'YES' which aligns with the problem description. If b is not equal to a, it then checks if c is equal to 0. If c is 0, it prints 'NO', as mentioned in the problem description. If c is not 0, it proceeds to check if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES' as expected. The logic in the code matches with the problem description for all potential cases.
