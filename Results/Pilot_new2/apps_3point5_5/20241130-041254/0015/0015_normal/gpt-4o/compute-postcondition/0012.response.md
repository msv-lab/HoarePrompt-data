Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The values of b and a are not equal. If c == 0, the program prints 'NO'. If c != 0 and (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
