Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string representing the number received by Kate, `t` is a substring of `s` with leading zeroes, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string containing the character `c` appended to its previous value, `c` is in `t_set`, the next character in `s` should be considered for `c`. After the execution of the if block, the program maintains the same state as the initial condition with the additional consideration that the character `c` is in `t_set`.***
