According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a substring of `s` with leading zeroes, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string containing the character `c` appended to its previous value, `c` is in `t_set`. 

To execute one more time, the next character in `s` should be considered for `c`, so the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string representing the new number received by Kate, `t` is a substring of `s` with leading zeroes, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string containing the new character `c` appended to its previous value, `c` is in `t_set**`.
