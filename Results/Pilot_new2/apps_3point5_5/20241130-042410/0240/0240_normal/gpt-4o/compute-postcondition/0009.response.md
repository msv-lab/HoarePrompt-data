According to the code, the loop can execute again depending on the permutations of the characters in the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `sub`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `sub` needs to be considered.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `sub`.**
