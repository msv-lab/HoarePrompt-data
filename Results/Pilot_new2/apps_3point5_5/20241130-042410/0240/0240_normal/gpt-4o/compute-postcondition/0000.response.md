According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the `permutations` function can generate permutations of the `chars` string. In this case, the loop will execute if there are permutations of the `chars` string, which means `chars` must be a non-empty string. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`.**
