The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `sub`, where `s` is a string representing a very large integer, and `sub` is a substring of `s`. The function first calculates the difference in length between `s` and `sub` and then updates the count of characters in `s` by subtracting the count of characters in `sub`. After generating possible numbers from the remaining characters, it returns the smallest number among them. However, there is a missing functionality in the code where the function `generate_possible_numbers` is used but not defined. This missing definition would affect the actual functionality of the code.
