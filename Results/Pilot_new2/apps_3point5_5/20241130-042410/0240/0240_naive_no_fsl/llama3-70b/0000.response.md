Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle the case where the substring t contains leading zeroes. In this case, the function `func_1` will not properly construct the smallest integer n that Vasya could pass to Kate. 

For example, if the input is:
```
003512
021
```
The expected output should be `30021`, but the program will output `3512` instead. This is because the program does not consider the leading zeroes in the substring t.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the correctness should be **False**.
