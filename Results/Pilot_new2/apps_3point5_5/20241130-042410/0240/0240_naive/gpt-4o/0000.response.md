Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly read input from standard input. The code `import sys input = sys.stdin.read` is trying to read input from standard input, but it is not the correct way to read input in this scenario. The correct way would be to read input using `input()` function or reading from a file. The program should be modified to read input correctly in order to work as expected.
