Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly rounds the input number to the nearest integer that ends with 0 as described in the problem statement. It checks if the remainder of the input number divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, then it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from the number, otherwise it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder. The program handles all potential cases where the input number may need to be rounded up or down to the nearest integer ending with 0. There are no edge cases provided where the program fails to produce the correct output.
