Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It rounds the given non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` already ends with 0, it considers it already rounded. The program checks if `n % 10 == 0`, and if it is true, it simply prints `n`. If `n % 10` is not equal to 0, it then checks whether `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it updates `n` to `n - n % 10`. Otherwise, it updates `n` to `n + (10 - n % 10)`. 

The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and correctly rounds the number to the nearest integer ending with 0.
