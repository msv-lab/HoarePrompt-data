Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n % 10 == 0, n is printed. If n % 10 is not equal to 0, then n is updated based on the following conditions: if n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, n is updated to n - n % 10. If n % 10 is larger than 5, n is updated to n + (10 - n % 10).***
