Output State: **`found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` and a value of 1, `i` is the starting value of the range, `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, `n` is greater than or equal to `j+1`, `color` is in `window_counts`. The condition (count == target) for (count, target) in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts) is True for all elements. The code breaks out of the loop or if statement it is in.**
