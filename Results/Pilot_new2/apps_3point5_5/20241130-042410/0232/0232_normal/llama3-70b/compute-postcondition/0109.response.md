Output State: **`found` remains True, `window_counts` still contains the previous key-value pair `color: 1`, `i` remains the same starting value, `color` is still equal to `colors[j]`, `n` is still greater than or equal to `j+2`, `color` is still in `window_counts`, and the condition (count == target) for (count, target) in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts) is still True for all elements. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
