#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, where each color is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. k is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, and the sum of all elements in k is at least 1 and at most n.**
def func_1(n, m, colors, k):
    desired_counts = dict(zip(range(1, m + 1), k))
    current_counts = defaultdict(int)
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        current_counts[colors[right]] += 1
        
        while all(current_counts[color] >= desired_counts[color] for color in
            desired_counts):
            if all(current_counts[color] == desired_counts[color] for color in
                desired_counts):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: After the loop executes, the count of all colors in `current_counts` will be equal to the count in `desired_counts` for all colors. If this condition is met, the program will return 'YES'. The final value of 'left' will be such that the loop terminates when all colors have their counts matching the desired counts.
    #**All colors in current_counts have counts equal to desired_counts, 'left' is at a value where the loop stops**
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It creates a dictionary `desired_counts` mapping colors to their desired counts. It then iterates through the list of colors, updating the counts in `current_counts`. If the counts of all colors match the desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The program handles cases where the count of a color in `current_counts` is still greater than or equal to the desired count, and it increments the 'left' index by 2 in a specific case. The function conforms to the postconditions in cases where it returns 'YES' or 'NO'.
