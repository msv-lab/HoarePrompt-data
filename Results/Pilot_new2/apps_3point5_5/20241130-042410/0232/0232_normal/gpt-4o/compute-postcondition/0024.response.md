According to the code, the loop can execute only if for all colors, the count in `current_counts` is greater than or equal to the desired count. Right before the loop, there exists at least one color for which the count in `current_counts` is less than the desired count. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, the count of the color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` must be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **There exists at least one color for which the count in `current_counts` is less than the desired count, the count of the color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` must be increased by 1**
