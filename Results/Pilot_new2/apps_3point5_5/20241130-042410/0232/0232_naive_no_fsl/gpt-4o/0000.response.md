Correctness: True

The program correctly implements the logic to check if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. It iterates through the list of colors, maintaining a sliding window and checking if the current window satisfies the desired color counts. The program returns 'YES' if such an interval is found, otherwise it returns 'NO'. The implementation follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
