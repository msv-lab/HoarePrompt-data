Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, then iterates over all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights to check if the desired color counts match the actual counts in that interval. If such an interval is found, it sets the `found` flag to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then outputs "YES" if a valid interval is found, and "NO" otherwise. The logic implemented in the program matches the problem description and covers all possible cases, making it correct.
