Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, then there will definitely be more upvotes than downvotes, so the result will be "+".
- If `x` is less than `y`, then there will definitely be more downvotes than upvotes, so the result will be "-".
- If `x` is equal to `y`, and `z` is 0, then the result will be "0" as the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal.
- If `x` is equal to `y`, but `z` is not 0, then the result will be uncertain as the unknown votes can tip the balance either way.
