Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the input. It then performs a series of comparisons based on the values of x, y, and z and prints out different symbols ('+', '-', '0', or '?') based on the conditions met. The function does not explicitly return any value. The program works with predefined non-negative integers x, y, and z such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.**
