Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The condition x is not greater than y + z is true. If x < y, then the program's state remains unchanged. If x == y, and z == 0, then z remains 0. If x == y, and z != 0, then z is updated to a non-zero value. If x is not less than y, x is greater than or equal to y, and x is not greater than y + z, the program's state remains unchanged.***
