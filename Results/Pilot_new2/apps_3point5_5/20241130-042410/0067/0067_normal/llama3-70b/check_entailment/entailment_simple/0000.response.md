Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It checks if the number of upvotes is greater than the sum of downvotes and unknown votes, in which case it prints "+". If not, it checks if the number of downvotes is greater than upvotes, in which case it prints "-". If the number of upvotes is equal to the number of downvotes, it checks if there are unknown votes. If there are no unknown votes (z == 0), it prints "0". Otherwise, it prints "?". This covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
