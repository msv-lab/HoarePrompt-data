Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. 
1. If there are more people upvoting than downvoting and unknown votes combined, it prints '+'. 
2. If there are more people downvoting than upvoting, it prints '-'. 
3. If the number of upvoters is equal to the number of downvoters and there are no unknown voters, it prints '0'. 
4. If there are unknown voters, then the result is marked as uncertain by printing '?'. 

The code covers all scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
