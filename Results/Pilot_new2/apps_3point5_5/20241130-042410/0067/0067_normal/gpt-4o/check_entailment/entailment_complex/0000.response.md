Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three non-negative integers representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or are unknown. It calculates the minimum and maximum values for upvotes and downvotes based on these inputs. Then, it correctly determines the result based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. Thus, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
