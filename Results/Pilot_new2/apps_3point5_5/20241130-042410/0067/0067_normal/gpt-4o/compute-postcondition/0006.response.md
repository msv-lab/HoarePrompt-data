Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x` + `z`, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. After the if condition, `max_upvotes` is still less than `min_downvotes`.**
