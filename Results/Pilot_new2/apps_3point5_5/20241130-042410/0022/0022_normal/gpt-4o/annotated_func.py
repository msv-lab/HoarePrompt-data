#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: s is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, n is even (n % 2 == 0). If s is a palindrome, then the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the string s is a palindrome, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters. It calculates the length of the string `s` and iterates through the first half of the string checking if it is a palindrome. If the string `s` is a palindrome, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function correctly identifies palindromes, returning True, and non-palindromes, returning False, without any missing functionality or edge cases.
