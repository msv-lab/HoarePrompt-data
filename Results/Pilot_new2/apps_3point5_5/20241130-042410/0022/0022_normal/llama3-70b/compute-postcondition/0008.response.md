According to the code, the loop can execute again until i reaches n // 2. At the end of the last iteration, s is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; n is the length of string s, n is at least 2; is_spalindrome is False, i is 0 and the character at index i in s is not equal to the character at index n - i - 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; n is the length of string s, n is at least 2; is_spalindrome is False, i is 1**
