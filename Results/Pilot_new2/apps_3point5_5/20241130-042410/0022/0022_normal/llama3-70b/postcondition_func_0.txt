The function `func` takes input from the user as a string `s` of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters. It then checks if the string is a palindrome by iterating through its characters. If the characters at the symmetric positions are equal for all characters up to the middle of the string, it prints 'TAK' indicating that the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
