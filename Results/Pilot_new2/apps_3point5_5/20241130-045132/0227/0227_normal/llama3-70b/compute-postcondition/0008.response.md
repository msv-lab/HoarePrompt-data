According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. If a[i] is not twice the value of a[i - 1], `m` is updated to 2, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be at least 2.
State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. If a[i] is not twice the value of a[i - 1], m is updated to 2, i is 2**
