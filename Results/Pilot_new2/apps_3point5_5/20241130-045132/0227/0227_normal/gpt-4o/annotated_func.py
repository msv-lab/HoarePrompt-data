#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9.**
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        
        if not can_form:
            m += 1
        
        assigned.add(a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: n is greater than 1, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is a set containing all elements of list a, m is equal to the number of unique differences between elements in assigned, can_form is True if and only if m is 1.
    return m
    #The program returns the number of unique differences between elements in list 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a. It sorts the list a in ascending order, then iterates through the list to find the number of unique differences between elements. The function returns this count as the final result.
