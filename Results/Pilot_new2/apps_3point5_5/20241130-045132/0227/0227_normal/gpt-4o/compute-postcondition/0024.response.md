According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is a set containing the last element of list a and the element added at index i, `m` is either 1 or 2, `i` is equal to n-1, `can_form` is True if m is 1 and False if m is 2. The loop has executed for all elements in the assigned set without breaking. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be less than `n`. Since `i` is equal to n-1 at the end of the last iteration, to execute one more time `i` should be less than n-1.
State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is a set containing the last element of list a and the element added at index i, m is either 1 or 2, i is equal to n-2, can_form is True if m is 1 and False if m is 2**
