Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the balance of the given string $s$ and then checks if the balance is equal to the desired balance $x$. If it is, it prints the length of the string plus 1. If the difference between $x$ and the balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of 0 and 1 in $s$, it prints -1 indicating an infinite number of prefixes. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the number of prefixes required to achieve the desired balance. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and hence is correct.
