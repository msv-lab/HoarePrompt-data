Postcondition: ***Output State: balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1, n is assigned a specific value, x is updated to x - balance + cnt0 - cnt1 + 1, and s contains the input string entered by the user. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, x is updated to x - balance + cnt0 - cnt1 + 1 due to the print function which outputs -1. Otherwise, x is updated to ((x + cnt1) // cnt0) + 1.***
