Postcondition: ***`n` is equal to the second element of the data list, `x` is equal to the third element of the data list, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is incremented by 3, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n+1` where each element is the cumulative sum of the changes based on the condition in the loop, `count` is 4, `prefix_balances` has at least 3 elements, and `((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0)` is true.***
