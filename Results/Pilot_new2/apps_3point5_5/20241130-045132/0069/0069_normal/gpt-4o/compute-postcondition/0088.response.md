Output State: **index is increased by n + 1, balance is now equal to s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the differences in counts of '0' and '1' up to that index in the string s, starting from index 0, T must be greater than 1, n is the integer value obtained from data at the index, x is the integer value obtained from data at index + 1, s is now equal to the string data[index + 2], balance is now equal to s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances[i] is updated to prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) where i represents the current index.**
