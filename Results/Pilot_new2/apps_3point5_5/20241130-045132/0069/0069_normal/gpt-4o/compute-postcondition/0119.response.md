Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data from the standard input, processes the data to calculate balance values, and appends results based on specific conditions to the results list. The function then prints out the results. However, the function lacks explicit parameter handling and return values based on the annotations provided. The overall functionality includes data processing and result computation, but it does not follow the annotated postconditions entirely.**
