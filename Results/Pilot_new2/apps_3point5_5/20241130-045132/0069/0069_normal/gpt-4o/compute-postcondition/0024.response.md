Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, 'n' is equal to the second element of the data list, 'x' is equal to the third element of the data list, 's' is assigned the value of data[index + 2], 'index' is incremented by 3, 'results' list contains either -1 or 0, 'balance' is equal to the difference between the count of '0's and the count of '1's in string s, 'prefix_balances' is a list of size n+1 where each element is the cumulative sum of the changes based on the condition in the loop. If 'x' is in 'prefix_balances', the postcondition retains the initial state and 'results' list contains -1; otherwise, if 'x' is not in 'prefix_balances', 'balance' remains 0 and 'results' list contains 0.***
