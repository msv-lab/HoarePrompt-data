Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all remainders of n modulo i for 1 ≤ i ≤ k are distinct. It initializes a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n. It then iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n modulo i, and checks if the remainder is already in the set of seen remainders. If it is, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. If the loop completes without finding any repeated remainders, the program returns 'Yes'. The logic implemented in the program ensures that all remainders are distinct as required by the problem description.
