According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is strictly less than `n`. In this case, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 which would make `i` equal to 2.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is strictly less than n, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainder, i is 2, remainder is n % 1 which is equal to 0**
