Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, with 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. It then checks the relationship between n and k. If k is greater than or equal to n, it returns 'No'. If the remainder of dividing n by i, where i ranges from 1 to k, has been seen before, it returns 'No'. If none of the conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.**
