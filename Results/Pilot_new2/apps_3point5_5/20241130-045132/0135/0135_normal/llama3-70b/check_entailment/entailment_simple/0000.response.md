Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes input values for `n` and `k`, then iterates through the range of `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. It checks if this remainder has been seen before in the `seen` set, and if so, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are distinct, it prints 'Yes' at the end.

The program ensures that it checks for all remainders from 1 to k and makes sure that none of them are repeated. Therefore, it satisfies the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
