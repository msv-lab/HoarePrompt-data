Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the remainders of `n` divided by each `i` from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits the program. If no remainders are repeated, it prints 'Yes'. This logic ensures that all remainders are distinct as required by the problem description.
