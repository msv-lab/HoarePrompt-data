Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the described scenario of employees from two factions taking turns to remove others from voting until only one person is left. The program maintains two queues, one for Democrats and one for Republicans, and iterates through them according to the rules described in the problem.

The program correctly simulates the process of employees taking turns to remove others from voting based on their party affiliation, just as described in the problem statement. It handles the cases where employees are skipped if they have already been removed, and correctly prints the outcome based on the last person remaining in the queue.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
