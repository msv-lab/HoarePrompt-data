Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a sequence of characters representing Democrats ('D') and Republicans ('R') in a queue. The function then simulates the process of removing individuals from the queue based on their party affiliation:
1. If the first person in the queue is a Democrat ('D'), they are removed.
2. If the first person is a Republican ('R'), they are removed, and the person behind them moves to the end of the queue.
This removal process continues cyclically until the queue is empty. The function finally prints the party affiliation of the last person remaining in the queue, which could be 'D' or 'R'.**
