According to the code, the loop will execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. Right before the loop, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
1. If `n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, then it remains valid.
2. If `votes` is a string with at least one character, then it remains valid.
3. If `i` is equal to the total number of characters in the votes string minus 1, then it remains valid.
4. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` must not be empty for the loop to execute.
5. If `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` must not be empty for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000; `votes` is a string with at least one character; `i` is equal to the total number of characters in the votes string minus 1; If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` must not be empty; If `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` must not be empty**
