According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000
- `votes` is a string with at least one character
- `i` is equal to the total number of characters in the votes string minus 1
- If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` must not be empty
- If `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` must not be empty
- `d_index` is equal to the value removed from the front of `d_queue`
- `r_index` is equal to the value removed from the front of `r_queue` except the first element
- If `d_index` < `r_index`, `d_queue` has `d_index + n` appended to it. Otherwise, `r_queue` has a new element appended at the end, which is the sum of the previous `r_index` value and `n`

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states in such a way that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are still not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the adjustment:
- If `d_index` < `r_index`, `d_queue` must have at least one element
- If `d_index` >= `r_index`, `r_queue` must have at least one element

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000; `votes` is a string with at least one character; `i` is equal to the total number of characters in the votes string minus 1; if `v` is 'D', `d_queue` must not be empty; if `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` must not be empty; `d_index` is equal to the value removed from the front of `d_queue`; `r_index` is equal to the value removed from the front of `r_queue` except the first element. If `d_index` < `r_index`, `d_queue` must have at least one element; if `d_index` >= `r_index`, `r_queue` must have at least one element**
