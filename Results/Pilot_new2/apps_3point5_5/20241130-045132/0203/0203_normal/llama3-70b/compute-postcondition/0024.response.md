The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return a list of strings containing either "D" or "R" based on the number of employees specified by a positive integer `n`. The list will have alternating values starting with "D" until the number of Democrats (`D`) equals the number of Republicans (`R`) and will end with the remaining party members.
