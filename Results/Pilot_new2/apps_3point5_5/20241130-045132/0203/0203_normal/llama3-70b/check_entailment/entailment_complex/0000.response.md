Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input representing the number of employees and their political affiliations, then calculates the count of depublicans and remocrats. Finally, it prints 'D' if the count of depublicans is greater than the count of remocrats, and 'R' otherwise.

The program follows the voting procedure as specified in the problem description, where employees take turns making statements and denying others the right to vote until only one employee is left. The outcome of the vote is determined based on the counts of depublicans and remocrats.

Therefore, the program is correct and outputs the correct result for all possible cases based on the problem description.
