Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the described voting procedure where employees take turns making statements and denying others the right to vote. The program maintains separate queues for depublicans and remocrats, and iterates through the queues until one of them is empty. The program correctly handles the scenario where an employee skips their turn if they have been denied the right to vote. The final output correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on which queue is not empty at the end. The program covers all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately.
