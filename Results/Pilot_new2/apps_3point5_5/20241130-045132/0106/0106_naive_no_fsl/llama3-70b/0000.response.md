Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly calculates the floor and block numbers for both Edward and Natasha's apartments.
- It then calculates the minimum time required to move between the blocks and the minimum time required to move between the floors within a block.
- The program handles the circular nature of the building by considering the minimum block distance either clockwise or counterclockwise around the building.
- Finally, it prints the sum of the minimum block time and minimum floor time, which gives the total minimum time Edward needs to reach Natasha's apartment.

Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
