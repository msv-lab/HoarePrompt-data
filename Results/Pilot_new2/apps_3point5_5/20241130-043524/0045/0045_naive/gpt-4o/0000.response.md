Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes two integers n and k as input, calculates the minimum sum that can be obtained from a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers, and then calculates the sequence based on the given constraints. If the minimum sum is greater than n, it returns -1 indicating that there is no possible sequence. Otherwise, it calculates the sequence and returns it.

The program follows the problem description accurately by ensuring that the sequence is strictly increasing, the sum is equal to n, and the greatest common divisor is maximum. It also handles the case where there is no possible sequence by returning -1. Additionally, the program uses integer division and looping to generate the sequence efficiently. 

Based on the provided examples and the logic implemented in the code, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
