The function func_1 accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10, and calculates the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function achieves this by iteratively updating `a` and `b` until `b` becomes 0. It then returns the final value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor.
