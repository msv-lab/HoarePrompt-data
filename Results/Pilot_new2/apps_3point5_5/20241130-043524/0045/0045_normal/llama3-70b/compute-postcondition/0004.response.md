According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `b` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is equal to the previous value of `a` modulo `b` where `b` is adjusted to a value not equal to 0. To ensure the loop can execute again, `b` should be adjusted to a value not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is equal to the previous value of `a` modulo `b` where `b` is adjusted to a value not equal to 0**
