According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `b` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the previous value of `a` modulo `b`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `b` must be adjusted to a value that is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is equal to the previous value of `a` modulo `b`, and `b` must be adjusted to a value not equal to 0**
