Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. This function can be used within the context of the given problem to find the greatest common divisor of a sequence of positive integers.

By using this function, we can find a sequence of positive integers that sum up to `n` and have the maximal greatest common divisor. The program does not directly provide the sequence as output, but it does provide the necessary tool to calculate the greatest common divisor, which is a crucial step in finding the sequence.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description by providing the means to calculate the greatest common divisor needed to solve the problem.
