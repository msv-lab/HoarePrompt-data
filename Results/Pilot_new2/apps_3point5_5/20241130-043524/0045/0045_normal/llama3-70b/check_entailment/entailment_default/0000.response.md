Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input for n and k, and then checks if n is less than k. If n is less than k, it prints -1 as the answer does not exist.
- Otherwise, it iterates from 1 to k and creates a sequence such that each number is strictly increasing and the sum is equal to n. If at any point n becomes less than i, it breaks the loop. If the length of the sequence is not equal to k, it prints -1. If the sequence is of length k, it prints the sequence.
- The code follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases as mentioned in the problem description.
- The output hints also align with the code description, and the function func_1 correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive integers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.
