Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2 and min_sum is less than or equal to n. d is n divided by min_sum. remainder is n - d * min_sum - 3. sequence is a list of values where each value is d times the index plus 1 for indices ranging from 0 to k-1. i is k-3. If remainder == 0, then sequence[i] is incremented by 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
