Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values and calculates the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price correctly. It then correctly compares these prices to determine whether to buy and sell shares or not. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it simply prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining bourles, and the maximum sell price to determine the total bourles after the evening. The program follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
