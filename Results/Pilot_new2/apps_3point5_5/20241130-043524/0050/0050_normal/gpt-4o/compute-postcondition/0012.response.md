Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are integers obtained from the input. `s` and `b` are lists of integers created by mapping the `int` function to the input. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the program prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, `total_bourles` is calculated as the product of `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` added to `remaining_bourles`.***
