You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Welcome to Codeforces Stock Exchange! We're pretty limited now as we currently allow trading on one stock, Codeforces Ltd. We hope you'll still be able to make profit from the market!

In the morning, there are $n$ opportunities to buy shares. The $i$-th of them allows to buy as many shares as you want, each at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

In the evening, there are $m$ opportunities to sell shares. The $i$-th of them allows to sell as many shares as you want, each at the price of $b_i$ bourles. You can't sell more shares than you have.

It's morning now and you possess $r$ bourles and no shares.

What is the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m, r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 30$, $1 \leq m \leq 30$, $1 \leq r \leq 1000$) — the number of ways to buy the shares on the market, the number of ways to sell the shares on the market, and the number of bourles you hold now.

The next line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$); $s_i$ indicates the opportunity to buy shares at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

The following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 1000$); $b_i$ indicates the opportunity to sell shares at the price of $b_i$ bourles.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
4 2 5
4 4 5 4

Output
26

Input
2 2 50
5 7
4 2

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first example test, you have $11$ bourles in the morning. It's optimal to buy $5$ shares of a stock at the price of $2$ bourles in the morning, and then to sell all of them at the price of $5$ bourles in the evening. It's easy to verify that you'll have $26$ bourles after the evening.

In the second example test, it's optimal not to take any action.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
