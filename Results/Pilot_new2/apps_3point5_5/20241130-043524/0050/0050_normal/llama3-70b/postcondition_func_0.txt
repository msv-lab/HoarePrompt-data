The function `func` reads input for `n`, `m`, and `r`, followed by lists `s` and `b`. It sorts `s` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. It then iterates through `s` and calculates the total number of shares earned based on the remainder `r` after division. After the first loop completes, it iterates through `b` and updates `r` based on shares earned. The final value of `r` is printed. The function does not accept any parameters, and it does not have a return value.
