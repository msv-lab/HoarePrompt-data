Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two very long integers a and b correctly using `input().split()` to split the input into two parts. It then removes leading zeroes from both a and b using `lstrip('0')`.
2. The program correctly handles cases where a or b after removing leading zeroes might be an empty string, in which case it assigns '0' to them.
3. It then compares the lengths of a and b, and if they are not equal, it prints the corresponding symbol ('<' or '>').
4. If the lengths are equal, it then compares the strings a and b directly to determine if they are equal, greater than, or less than each other, and prints the corresponding symbol ('<' or '>'). If they are equal, it prints '='.
5. The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each of them.
