Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as strings and removes any leading zeroes using the lstrip('0') method.
2. It then compares the two strings a and b lexicographically to determine the relationship between the two numbers.
3. The program correctly handles cases where a < b, a > b, or a == b based on the problem description.
4. The program accounts for cases where the numbers have leading zeroes and correctly compares them.
