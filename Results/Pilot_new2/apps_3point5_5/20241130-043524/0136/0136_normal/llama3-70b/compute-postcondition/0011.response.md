The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It does not have any input parameters. The function is expected to return a value based on certain calculations using the non-negative integers `a` and `b` with at most 10^6 digits. However, since there are no input parameters specified, it is unclear what specific values of `a` and `b` will be used in the function's calculations. Therefore, without any input parameters, the functionality of the function `func` remains unknown.
