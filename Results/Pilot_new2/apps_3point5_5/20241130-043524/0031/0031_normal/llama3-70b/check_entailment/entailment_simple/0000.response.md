Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not calculate the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday correctly. The calculation of probability based on the problem description should involve the complement of the event that no two people share the same birthday.
The loop in the provided program doesn't handle the complement of this event. The loop should iterate over the range of k-1 to 0 instead of 0 to k-1 to calculate the complement event correctly.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
