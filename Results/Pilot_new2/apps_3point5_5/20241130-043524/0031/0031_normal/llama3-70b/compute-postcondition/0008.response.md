Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is equal to 2 raised to the power of n; numerator is equal to total_days multiplied by (total_days - i); denominator is equal to 2 raised to the power of n; i is 1; denominator is now equal to total_days squared**.
