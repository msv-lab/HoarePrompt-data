According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n, k, total_days, numerator, and denominator have specific values. Since i is increased by 1 for the next iteration, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is equal to 2 raised to the power of n; numerator is equal to total_days multiplied by (total_days - i); denominator is equal to total_days squared; i is 2**
