According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, so it becomes i+1. Also, `k` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `k-1`.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; MOD is assigned the value 10^6 + 3; total_days is equal to 2^n; numerator is assigned the value `(total_days - (i+1)) % MOD`; denominator is assigned the value `total_days % MOD`; `i` has been increased by 1; `k` is at least 2**
