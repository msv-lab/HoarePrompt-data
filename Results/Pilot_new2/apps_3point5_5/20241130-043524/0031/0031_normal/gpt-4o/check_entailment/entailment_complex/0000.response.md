Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days.
2. It handles cases where k is greater than 1 shifted left by n.
3. The code uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and outputs the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3, as required.
4. The annotations provided also align with the problem description and the code logic.
5. The examples provided in the problem description are covered by the code, ensuring correctness.
