#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^18. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the original value of `b` if `b` is not equal to 0 and is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function first checks if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, and if so, it prints 1 and 1 and returns. Then, it calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` using a for loop. After the loop, it computes `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and `p_shared` based on the calculated values. Next, it calls another function `func_1` with parameters A and B, and adjusts the values A and B accordingly. Finally, it prints the remainders of A and B after division by MOD. The intended functionality includes handling cases where k is not greater than 1 shifted left by n, and more details about the calculations performed inside the loop could be included for a comprehensive understanding.
