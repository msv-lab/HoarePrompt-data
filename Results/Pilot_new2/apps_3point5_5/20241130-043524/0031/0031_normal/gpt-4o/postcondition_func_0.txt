The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^18. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the original value of `b` if `b` is not equal to 0 and is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
