Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days.
2. It handles cases where k is greater than 2^n by setting the probability as 1/1, which is correct.
3. The program uses the provided formulas to calculate the probability and then reduces the fraction to its simplest form, taking into account the modulo operation.
4. The program iterates through k people and calculates the numerator and denominator accordingly to compute the probability.
5. The final output is the irreducible fraction A/B, which is reduced to modulo 10^6 + 3.
