Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes the input side lengths of the starting and ending equilateral triangles, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. This logic is correct as it directly provides the minimum number of seconds required to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The program handles all potential cases as per the problem description, ensuring the correctness of the output.
