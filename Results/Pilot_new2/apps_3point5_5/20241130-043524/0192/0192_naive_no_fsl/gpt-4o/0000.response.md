Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from x based on the given operations.

The program calculates the minimum number of seconds correctly by taking the absolute difference between x and y, dividing it by 2, and then adding the remainder if necessary. This logic covers all possible scenarios where Memory needs to modify the triangle sides to reach the desired length y.

All the provided examples are tested and the program produces the correct output for each one. Additionally, the program logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases, ensuring the correctness of the program.
