The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state indicates that `is_palindrome` is `True`, but the new assignment changes it to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged, but since the variable `is_palindrome` was initially `True`, it is now inconsistent with the new value assigned to `is_spalindrome`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_palindrome` is False, `i` is 0.**
