The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The initial state specifies that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers input from the user in the range [0, 100], and `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will be equal to the sum of `x` and `z`, both of which are in the range [0, 100]. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]; `y` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]; `z` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.**
