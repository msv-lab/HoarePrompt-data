`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, which is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100]. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100], `y` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100], `z` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100], and `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100], `y` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100], `z` is an integer input from the user in the range [0, 100], `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.**
