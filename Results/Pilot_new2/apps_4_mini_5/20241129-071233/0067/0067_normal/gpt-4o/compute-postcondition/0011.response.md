The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs a string. This does not alter any of the existing variables. Therefore, no changes are made to the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, or `max_downvotes`. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers in the range [0, 100]; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; and `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.**
