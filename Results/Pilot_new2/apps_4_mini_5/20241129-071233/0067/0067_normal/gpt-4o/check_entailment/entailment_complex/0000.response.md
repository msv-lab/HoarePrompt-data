Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown voting intentions, respectively. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Logic for Results**:
   - The program calculates `min_upvotes` as `x` (the confirmed upvotes) and `max_upvotes` as `x + z` (the maximum possible upvotes considering all unknown voters could vote positively).
   - Similarly, it calculates `min_downvotes` as `y` (the confirmed downvotes) and `max_downvotes` as `y + z` (the maximum possible downvotes).
   
3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - It first checks if `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`: If this condition is true, it concludes that there are definitely more downvotes than upvotes and prints `'-'`, which is correct.
   - The next check is if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`: If this condition is true, it concludes that there are definitely more upvotes than downvotes and prints `'+'`, which is also correct.
   - If neither condition is met, it implies that there is uncertainty (i.e., the scenarios of unknown voters could lead to different results) and the program prints `'?'`, which matches the problem statement.

4. **Coverage of All Scenarios**: The program correctly covers all potential situations:
   - When all voters are known and lead clearly to one result.
   - When unknown voters could lead to different outcomes, resulting in uncertainty.

By thoroughly assessing the logic and flow of the program, it can be confirmed that it accurately fulfills the requirements and conditions laid out in the problem description for all valid input cases. Thus, the program is implemented correctly.

Overall, the program meets the problem description perfectly, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is: **True**.
