To assess the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it based on the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The program needs to determine the voting outcome based on:
- `x`: Number of known upvotes.
- `y`: Number of known downvotes.
- `z`: Number of unknown voting intentions.

According to the problem:
- If there are more upvotes than downvotes, the result should be "+".
- If there are more downvotes than upvotes, the result should be "-".
- If the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes, the result should be "0".
- If the outcome is uncertain (due to `z`), it should return "?".

### Program Logic:
The program calculates:
- `min_upvotes = x` (minimum upvotes are the known upvotes).
- `max_upvotes = x + z` (maximum upvotes consider all unknown votes as upvotes).
- `min_downvotes = y` (minimum downvotes are the known downvotes).
- `max_downvotes = y + z` (maximum downvotes consider all unknown votes as downvotes).

The program then checks:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'`, indicating a guaranteed loss.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'`, indicating a guaranteed win.
3. If neither condition is met, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty.

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
1. If `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, the program will output `'?'`, which agrees with the problem description because the single unknown vote could either be an upvote or downvote, leading to two different outcomes.
2. If `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`, the output will be `'-'`, which is correct as there are no unknown votes and clearly more downvotes.
3. If `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`, it outputs `'0'`, which is correct as both upvotes and downvotes are equal.
4. If `x = 2`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`, it will output `'+'`, which is correct since even with one unknown, upvotes are guaranteed to be more.

**Potential Missing Cases:**
The program does not explicitly cover all cases of uncertainty if there are unknown votes. However, it correctly implements the logic by evaluating the maximum and minimum values and outputting `'?'` when necessary.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints correctly summarize the functionality of the program:
- It accurately describes the conditions under which the program outputs `'-'`, `'+'`, and `'?'`, which aligns with the core logic of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all edge cases as expected, with no contradictions observed between the output hints and the described logic. Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
