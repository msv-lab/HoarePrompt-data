Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences, `found` is `True`, `i` is the original value of `i`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `window_counts` contains the counts of the colors found in the current window. If `found` is `True`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the loop does not execute, `found` remains `False`, `i` remains the original value, `j` is equal to `i`, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary.***
