The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not previously in `color_counts`, its value was initialized to 0. Therefore, after the execution, `color_counts[color]` will be 1 if it was previously 0, or it will increase to its previous value plus 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` < `n`, `colors` is a list of integers that contains at least 2 colors, if `color` was not in `color_counts` then `color_counts[color]` is now 1, otherwise `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
