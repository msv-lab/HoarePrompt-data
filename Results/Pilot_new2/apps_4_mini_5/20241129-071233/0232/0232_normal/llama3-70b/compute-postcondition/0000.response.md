The variables `n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from the input. The input consists of two integers, which are read and converted from the string format to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The range constraints of `n` and `m` remain valid. The specifics of the values of `n` and `m` after the input are determined by user input. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in these two variables while maintaining the validity of the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n**
