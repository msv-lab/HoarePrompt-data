Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors; `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences; `found` is now True; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `color` is equal to `colors[j]`; `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
