Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors; `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences; `found` is True if all the required counts from `window_counts` match the target counts in `counts`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `n`, `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of the colors from `colors` starting at index `i` up to `n-1`. If the loop does not execute, `found` remains True, `window_counts` remains empty, and `j` is equal to `n`.**
