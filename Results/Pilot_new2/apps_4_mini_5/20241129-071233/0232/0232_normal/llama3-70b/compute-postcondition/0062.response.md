Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences, `found` is `True`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1; if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts` after sorting, we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
