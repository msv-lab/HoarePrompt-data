The variable `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The specific value of `color` is equal to `colors[i]`, and since `color` is not in `window_counts` before this operation, `window_counts[color]` was previously set to 0. Therefore, after the increment, `window_counts[color]` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences, `found` is `True`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is equal to `colors[i]`, and `window_counts[color]` is 1.**
