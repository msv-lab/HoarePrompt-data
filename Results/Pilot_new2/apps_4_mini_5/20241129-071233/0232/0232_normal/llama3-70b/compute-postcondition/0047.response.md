Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each unique color from `colors` is a key with the corresponding count of occurrences in the `colors` list, `found` is `True` if the required color distribution has been found after iterating through `colors`; otherwise, `found` remains `False`. `i` is the original value of `i`, and `j` is equal to `n`. `window_counts` contains the counts of the colors found in the current window, which may or may not match the target counts in `counts`. If the loop does not execute, `found` remains `False`, `i` is the original value of `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary.**
