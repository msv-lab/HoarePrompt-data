The statement `window_counts[color] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the key `color` in the `window_counts` dictionary. The variable `color` is equal to `colors[i]`, and since `i` is less than `n`, `color` corresponds to a valid index in the `colors` list. The `window_counts` dictionary is being updated with the occurrence count of the specific color to 0. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors; `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences; `found` is True; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is equal to `i`; `color` is equal to `colors[i]`; `window_counts[color]` is 0.**
