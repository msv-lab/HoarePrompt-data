`left` is incremented by 1, which means the new value of `left` is the previous value of `left` plus 1. The value of `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1, implying that the count for the color at the current index `left` is reduced by 1. However, since `left` is updated and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is dependent on the new value of `left`, we can't specify `current_counts[colors[left]]` uniquely. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the previous value plus 1, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` has been decremented by 1.

Output State: **`left` is the previous value plus 1; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1.**
