The variable `left` is incremented by 1, increasing its previous value by 1. Additionally, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1, meaning it becomes one less than it was, while still satisfying the condition of being greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is the previous value plus 1; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is one less than it was and still greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]`.**
