The variable `left` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `left` is the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus 1, so after the increment, its new value will be one greater than the initial value. The value of `right` remains unchanged at 1, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is one greater than the number of elements processed from the `colors` list, `right` is 1.

Output State: **`left` is equal to the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus 2; `right` is 1.**
