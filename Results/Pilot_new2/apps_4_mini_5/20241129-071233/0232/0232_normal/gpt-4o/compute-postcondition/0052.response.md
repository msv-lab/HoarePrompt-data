The statement `current_counts[colors[left]] -= 1` decrements the count of the color at index `left` in the `current_counts` dictionary. The value of `left` represents the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus those satisfying the desired counts. 

The impact of this operation is that the count of the specific color in `current_counts` is reduced by 1. The values of other variables are not affected by this statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `left` represents the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus those satisfying the desired counts, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`left` represents the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus those satisfying the desired counts; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1.**
