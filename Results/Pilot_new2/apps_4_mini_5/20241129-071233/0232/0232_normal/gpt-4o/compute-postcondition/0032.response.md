Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus 1, `right` is 1, and `current_counts` has `current_counts[colors[left]]` increased back to be greater than `desired_counts[colors[left]]` for at least one color in `desired_counts`. If all colors in `desired_counts` match their respective counts in `current_counts`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
