Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; `k` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n; `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from each integer in the range 1 to m to the corresponding values in k; `current_counts` must have at least one entry less than its corresponding entry in `desired_counts`; `left` is 0; `right` is 0. The current value of `current_counts` for each color is equal to the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, therefore all entries in `current_counts` are equal to their corresponding entries in `desired_counts`.***
