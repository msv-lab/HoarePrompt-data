Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the rounding logic described in the problem statement. Here's how it fulfills the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a single non-negative integer `n` from the input, which aligns with the problem's constraints (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

2. **Condition for Already Rounded Numbers**: The first condition checks if `n % 10 == 0`. If true, it prints `n`, indicating that `n` is already a multiple of 10 and thus rounded.

3. **Rounding Logic**:
   - If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the program checks the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (`n % 10`).
   - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it calculates `n - n % 10`, which effectively rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10.
   - If the remainder is greater than 5, it calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which rounds `n` up to the next multiple of 10.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: 
   - When `n = 5`, both rounding to 0 and rounding to 10 are valid outputs, and the program can output either based on the implemented logic.
   - The program also covers all edge cases within the boundaries, such as rounding 0 to 0 and 10^9 to 10^9.

Overall, the implementation adheres to the problem description, correctly determining the nearest integer that ends in a 0 for all possible inputs. Thus, the program is verified to be correct.
