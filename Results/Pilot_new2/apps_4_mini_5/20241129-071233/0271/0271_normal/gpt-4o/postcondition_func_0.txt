The function prompts the user to input a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` (the remainder of `n` when divided by 10) is less than or equal to 5, the function subtracts the remainder from `n`. If the last digit is greater than 5, it adds the difference to reach the next multiple of 10. The result is printed; however, no value is returned from the function.
