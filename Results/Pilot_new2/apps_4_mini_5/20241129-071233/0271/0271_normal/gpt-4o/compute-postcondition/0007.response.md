The code snippet provided prints the value of `result`, which is calculated based on the value of `n` and its `remainder` when divided by 10. 

1. The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`.
2. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n - remainder`.
3. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`.

In the output state, `result` will hold the calculated value based on the condition met. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `result` is equal to `n - (n % 10)` if (n % 10) ≤ 5, otherwise `result` is equal to `n + (10 - (n % 10))**
