To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer \( n \) to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If \( n \) already ends with 0, it should remain unchanged. If \( n \) is between two multiples of 10, rounding down to the nearest multiple of 10 when \( n \% 10 \leq 5 \) or rounding up to the nearest multiple of 10 when \( n \% 10 > 5 \) is acceptable.

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) which is guaranteed to be between \( 0 \) and \( 10^9 \).
2. **Condition Check**:
   - If \( n \% 10 == 0 \): The number is already rounded, so it prints \( n \). This is correct.
   - If \( n \% 10 \leq 5 \): It calculates \( n - n \% 10 \) which correctly rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10. This is also correct.
   - If \( n \% 10 > 5 \): It calculates \( n + (10 - n \% 10) \) which correctly rounds up to the next multiple of 10. This too is correct.

### Edge Cases:
- For \( n = 0 \): The output should be 0, which the program correctly handles.
- For numbers like \( n = 5 \): The program can output either 0 or 10 (both are valid), and the program outputs 10, which is acceptable.
- For \( n = 10 \): The output should remain 10, which is correctly handled by the first condition.
- For numbers just below and above multiples of 10, like \( n = 14 \) and \( n = 16 \): The program correctly rounds down and up, respectively.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, I find that it correctly handles all potential cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, there are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
