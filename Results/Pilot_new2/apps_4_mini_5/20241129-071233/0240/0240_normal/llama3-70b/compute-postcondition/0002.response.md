According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must not be empty since it must contain characters to iterate over. The state currently indicates that `s` is a string of digits, and since it is stated to have a length not exceeding 1,000,000, we can assume it has characters as long as it is compliant with that condition. The substring `t` being non-empty and `t_set` containing unique characters from `t` does not directly affect the execution of the loop but are pertinent to the context of the program.

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure:
1. `s` is not an empty string, which it should be as per the condition stated (length up to 1,000,000).
2. The variable `c`, which will represent each character during the iteration, needs to be initialized, although this will be handled automatically by the loop.

Thus, the state can be mentioned without needing additional modifications related to the loop execution since `s` is a string of digits, and `n` is initialized but does not impact the loop execution itself. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, `n` is an empty string**
