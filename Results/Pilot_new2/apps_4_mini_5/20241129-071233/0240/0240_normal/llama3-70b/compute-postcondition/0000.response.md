The `t_set` variable is assigned the value of a set created from the substring `t`. This means that `t_set` will contain all unique characters (digits) found in `t`. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged, and `t` is also still valid as a substring of `s`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits (with a length not exceeding 1,000,000), `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`.**
