The code `yield candidate` is used to produce a value from a generator function, allowing the function to return `candidate` without terminating its execution. The variable `candidate` is already defined as the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged. Since `yield` produces a value, it indicates that `candidate` has been returned.

Output State: **`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` has been returned as the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`.**
