The variable `candidate` is assigned the value formed by joining the elements of the list `perm` into a string. The value of `perm` is determined by the next permutation of the digits contained in `chars`. Thus, `candidate` will be a string representation of that specific permutation. The states of the other variables, `chars` and `perm`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`.**
