The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts a string parameter `chars`, which contains digits, and a non-empty string parameter `sub`, which also consists of digits (potentially with leading zeroes). It generates and yields all valid permutations of the digits in `chars` that satisfy the condition defined by the `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` function. 

If `chars` is empty, no permutations will be generated, and consequently, no valid candidates will be yielded. The overall functionality is to provide all possible arrangements of the string `chars`, filtered by the validation against `sub`. However, the annotations imply an additional functionality of substituting occurrences of `sub` with various digit combinations, which is not evident in the code as provided. Thus, the function primarily focuses on yielding permutations rather than substitution.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`, yielding all valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the `is_valid_number` condition against `sub`. If `chars` is empty, no candidates are yielded. **
