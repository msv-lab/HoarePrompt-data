Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, then the program processes `candidate` as a valid number. Otherwise, no else part is defined.***
