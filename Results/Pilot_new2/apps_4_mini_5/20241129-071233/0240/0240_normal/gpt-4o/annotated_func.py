#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty substring of s which can contain leading zeroes.
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)

        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `n_len` is equal to `len(s) - len(sub)`, `s_counter` is a Counter of `s` with each character's count reduced by its corresponding count in `sub_counter`, `sub_counter` is a Counter of `sub`, and all characters in `sub_counter` have been processed.

    #The program returns the minimum integer from the possible_numbers, which is represented by 'smallest_number'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub` of `s`. It computes a new string with the characters of `s` reduced by the counts of characters in `sub`, and then generates possible numbers from this resulting string. Finally, it returns the smallest integer from these possible numbers, based on their integer value representation. However, if no valid possible numbers can be generated after removing the characters of `sub` from `s`, this could lead to an error when trying to find the minimum. Additionally, handling of leading zeroes in the substring may not be explicitly addressed in the logic, which could affect the output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a non-empty string representing a sequence of digits with a maximum length of 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string representing a substring of num_str that can contain leading zeroes.
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if 'sub' is found in 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `num_str` of digits and a non-empty substring `sub`, returning True if `sub` is found in `num_str` and `num_str` has a length equal to `n_len`, but may raise an error if `n_len` is not defined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a string containing digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string of digits which can contain leading zeroes.
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` represents all permutations of `chars`, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters in each permutation. The loop yields all valid candidates that satisfy the condition set by `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If no valid candidates exist, no yields occur. If `chars` is empty, no iterations occur, resulting in no candidates being yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`, yielding all valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the `is_valid_number` condition against `sub`. If `chars` is empty, no candidates are yielded.
