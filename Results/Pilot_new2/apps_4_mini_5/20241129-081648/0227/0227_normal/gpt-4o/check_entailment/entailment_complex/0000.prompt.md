You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You've got a positive integer sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. All numbers in the sequence are distinct. Let's fix the set of variables b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}. Initially each variable b_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ m) contains the value of zero. Consider the following sequence, consisting of n operations.

The first operation is assigning the value of a_1 to some variable b_{x} (1 ≤ x ≤ m). Each of the following n - 1 operations is assigning to some variable b_{y} the value that is equal to the sum of values that are stored in the variables b_{i} and b_{j} (1 ≤ i, j, y ≤ m). At that, the value that is assigned on the t-th operation, must equal a_{t}. For each operation numbers y, i, j are chosen anew.

Your task is to find the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 23). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that all numbers in the sequence are distinct.


-----Output-----

In a single line print a single number — the minimum number of variables m, such that those variables can help you perform the described sequence of operations.

If you cannot perform the sequence of operations at any m, print -1.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 6 8

Output
2

Input
3
3 6 5

Output
-1

Input
6
2 4 8 6 10 18

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first sample, you can use two variables b_1 and b_2 to perform the following sequence of operations.  b_1 := 1;  b_2 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2;  b_1 := b_1 + b_1;  b_1 := b_1 + b_2.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and a is a list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        
        if not can_form:
            m += 1
        
        assigned.add(a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `assigned` is a set containing all elements from the list `a`, `m` is the count of unique forms unable to be created from the elements of `assigned`, `n` is the original input value, `i` is `n - 1`.
    return m
    #The program returns the count of unique forms unable to be created from the elements of the set 'assigned' which is represented by 'm'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` containing `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list and counts the number of unique integers that cannot be expressed as the difference of two integers in a set formed by the elements of `a`. The function returns this count. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` might be empty or contain non-distinct elements, even though the input constraint requires `a` to have distinct integers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
