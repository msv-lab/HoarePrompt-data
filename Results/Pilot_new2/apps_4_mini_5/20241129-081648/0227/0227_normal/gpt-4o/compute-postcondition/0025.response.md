The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. There are no other variables affected by this assignment, and the other variables retain their previous states. Thus, the output state remains:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `assigned` is a set containing elements from the list `a` and now includes `a[1]`, `can_form` is False**
