The statement `assigned.add(a[i])` adds the element at index `i` from the list `a` to the set `assigned`. Since `i` is initially 1, the element added will be `a[1]`. The conditions regarding `n`, `can_form`, and the previous state of `assigned` remain unchanged aside from the addition of the new element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is a set containing elements from the list `a` and now includes `a[1]`**.
