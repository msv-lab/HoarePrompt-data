According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is defined to run for `i` in the range from 1 to `n - 1`, meaning it will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `n` is at least 3, the loop can still execute again when `i` is 3. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted such that `i` is now 3, and `n` must still be at least 3 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and if `a[2]` is not equal to `a[1] * 2`, then `m` is set to 3.**
