The operation `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it represents the count of integers in the list and is still an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23. The specific values in `a` will change to reflect the sorted order, but we don't have the specifics of those values since `a` is an input list.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers.**
