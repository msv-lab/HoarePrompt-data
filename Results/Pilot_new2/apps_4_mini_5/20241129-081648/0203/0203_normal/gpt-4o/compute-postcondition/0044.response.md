Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are both empty. If `d_queue` is not empty, then 'D' has been printed. If `d_queue` executed for at least one iteration, there must have been at least one 'D' and at least one 'R' in the original `votes`. If `d_queue` is empty and `r_queue` is also empty, then 'R' is printed.***
