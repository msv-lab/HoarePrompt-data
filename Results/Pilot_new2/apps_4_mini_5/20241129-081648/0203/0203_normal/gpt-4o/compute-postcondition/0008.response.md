The `r_queue` list is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `i` is currently 0, the first element in `r_queue` will become 0. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their values and conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is now [0], `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of `votes`, and `v` is not equal to 'D'.**
