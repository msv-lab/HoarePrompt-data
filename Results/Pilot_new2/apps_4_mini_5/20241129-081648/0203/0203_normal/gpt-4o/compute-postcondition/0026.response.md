Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has an additional element equal to `d_index + n` and `r_queue` has one less element than before. Otherwise, if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` has one less element than before and an additional element equal to `r_index + n`.***
