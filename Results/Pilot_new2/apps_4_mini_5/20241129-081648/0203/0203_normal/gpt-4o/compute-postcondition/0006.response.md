`d_queue` is updated by appending the current value of `i`, which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` is now [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the current value of `v` is 'D'.
