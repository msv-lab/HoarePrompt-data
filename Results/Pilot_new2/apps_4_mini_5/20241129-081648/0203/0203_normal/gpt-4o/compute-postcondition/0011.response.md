The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The variable `i` has a value of `k + 1`, but the specific value of `k` is not provided, so we do not know the exact value of `i`. Since `d_queue` is a list, its length will increase by 1, but we don't know its previous state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `k + 1`, `v` is the character at index `k + 1` in `votes`, and `i` has been appended to `d_queue`.**
