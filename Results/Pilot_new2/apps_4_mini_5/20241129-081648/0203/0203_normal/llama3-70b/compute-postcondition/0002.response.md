The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0, and there are no changes to the other variables. The initial conditions of `n` and `fractions` remain valid but unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is 0**.
