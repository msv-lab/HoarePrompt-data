According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `fractions` string. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `fractions` must contain at least one character. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, we know that `n` is at least 1, which implies that `fractions` must be a non-empty string.

At the start of the loop, the variable `fraction` will be assigned the first character of the `fractions` string during the first iteration. Thus, we need to ensure that `fraction` is initialized correctly at the beginning.

Since `depublicans` and `remocrats` are initialized to 0, they do not impact the execution of the loop directly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`**
