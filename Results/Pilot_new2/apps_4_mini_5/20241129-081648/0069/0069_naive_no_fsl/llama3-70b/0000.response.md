Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the balance of the string `s` is equal to zero. Specifically, if `cnt0` (count of '0's) equals `cnt1` (count of '1's), the balance becomes zero. If `x` is also zero, the program incorrectly prints `n + 1` as the result instead of returning `-1` for the infinite prefixes scenario.

Here's a counterexample:
- Input:
```
1 0
00
```
In this case, `s` has two '0's and zero '1's, so `cnt0 = 2`, `cnt1 = 0`, making the balance equal to `2 - 0 = 2`. The prefix with a balance of `0` can be achieved infinitely using any number of full strings of `s` as it consists of only '0's. The program would output `-1` for infinite prefixes in this case, but it would erroneously return `3`, indicating three prefixes of the infinite string `t`.

Thus, the program fails to handle this potential case correctly.
