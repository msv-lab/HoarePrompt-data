To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze what the loop does to the variables based on the provided initial state and the loop code.

The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and during each iteration, it updates the `prefix_balances` list at the index `i`. The value assigned to `prefix_balances[i]` is based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the current character of the string `s` at position `i - 1`. If the character is '0', it increments the balance by 1; if it is '1', it decrements the balance by 1.

After executing all iterations of the loop (from 1 to `n`), the following states will hold true:

- `prefix_balances[i]` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th character of the string `s`.
- The final value of `prefix_balances[n]` is equal to the initial value `prefix_balances[0]` (which is 0) plus the balance changes based on the occurrences of '0's and '1's in the string `s`.

Now, let's summarize the output states based on the provided output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times:

1. **For `i = n`, the loop has executed `n` times.**
2. `prefix_balances[n]` will be equal to `0 + (count of '0's in s) - (count of '1's in s)`, which is equivalent to `balance` as defined in the initial state.

Thus, after the loop completes all iterations, we can conclude the following:

- `T` is between 1 and 100.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` will be `n`.
- `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative balance for each index from 0 to `n`, with `prefix_balances[n]` ultimately reflecting the overall balance.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n`, and `prefix_balances[n]` is equal to `balance`.**
