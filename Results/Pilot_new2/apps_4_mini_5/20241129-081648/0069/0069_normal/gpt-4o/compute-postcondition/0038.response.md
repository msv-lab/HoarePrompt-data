The statement `results.append(count)` adds the value of `count` to the `results` list. The value of `count` is determined by the total number of valid values of `b` in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the given conditions. The other variables are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `n + 1`, `results` now contains the value of `count`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `count` is the total number of valid values of `b` in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` are both satisfied.**
