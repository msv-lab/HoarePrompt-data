The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` represents a specific value from a data structure, likely a list. The previous information states that `n` is a positive integer, but now it will be updated to a new integer value derived from the input data. The values of `T`, `i`, and `prefix_balances` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is int(data[index]), `i` is either `n` or `n + k`, and `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n` or `n + k`.**
