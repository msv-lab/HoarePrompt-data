The variable `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0', otherwise minus 1. The value of `i` is currently 1, so `prefix_balances[1]` will be updated based on the value of `s[0]`. The initial state indicates that `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1. The states of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `s`, `prefix_balances`) are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `prefix_balances[1]` is equal to `prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[0] == '0' else -1)`.**
