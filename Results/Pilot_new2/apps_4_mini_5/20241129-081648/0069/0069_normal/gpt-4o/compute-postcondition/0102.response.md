The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, so we only state that it has increased. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` must have at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`, and `count` is increased by 1.
