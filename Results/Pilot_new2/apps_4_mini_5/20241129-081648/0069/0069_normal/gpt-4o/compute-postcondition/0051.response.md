According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[2]` is equal to `prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1)**
