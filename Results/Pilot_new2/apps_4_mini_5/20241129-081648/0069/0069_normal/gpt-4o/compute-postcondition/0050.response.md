The code assigns a value to `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition of `s[i - 1]`. `prefix_balances[2]` was previously defined as `prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1)`. Now, we update `prefix_balances[2]` using the same logic with `i = 2`. 

1. The expression evaluates `prefix_balances[1]` as part of the previous state, but since `prefix_balances[2]` is being updated, we are now computing it for `i = 2`.
2. The value of `prefix_balances[2]` will depend on the value of `s[1]`. If `s[1]` is `'0'`, it increments by 1, otherwise, it decrements by 1.

Given that `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[2]` will be calculated as follows:
- If `s[1]` is `'0'`, `prefix_balances[2] = prefix_balances[1] + 1`
- If `s[1]` is not `'0'`, `prefix_balances[2] = prefix_balances[1] - 1`

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `prefix_balances[2]`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[2]` is equal to `prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1)`**
