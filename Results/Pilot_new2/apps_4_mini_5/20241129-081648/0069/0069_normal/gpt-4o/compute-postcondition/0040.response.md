According to the code, the loop executes `T` times, and at the end of the last iteration, we know that `T` is between 1 and 100. Since the loop is controlled by `T`, for it to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than the current iteration count, which is `_`. This implies that after the last iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given that `_` starts from 0 in the first iteration and increments by 1 with each loop, at the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to the number of completed iterations (which is `T - 1` for a zero-based index). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented to `T`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be equal to `T`. 

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the original integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0 or not equal to 0 (depending on previous states), and `_` is equal to `T`**
