Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the original integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `n + 1`, if `balance` is equal to 0, then if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, otherwise `results` contains a single element `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, then `results` contains the value of `count`, where `count` is the total number of valid values of `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`.***
