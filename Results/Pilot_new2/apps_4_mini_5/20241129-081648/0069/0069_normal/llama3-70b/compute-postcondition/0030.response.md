The code `print(n + 1)` outputs the value of `n + 1`. The variable `n` is an input positive integer, and its value has not changed during the execution of the code. The other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `T` is still greater than 0 and now is 1 less than its previous value, while `n + 1` has been printed.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `T` is now 1 less than its previous value, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer within the specified range, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1` and is unchanged.**
