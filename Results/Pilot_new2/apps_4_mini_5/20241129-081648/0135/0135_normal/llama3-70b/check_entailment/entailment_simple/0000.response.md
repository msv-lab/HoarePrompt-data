To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to check if it accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

The task is to determine if all remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from `1` to `k` are distinct. The program uses a set to track the remainders and checks for duplicates.

### Step-by-step Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers, `n` and `k`, which satisfy \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
  
2. **Using a Set**:
   - The program initializes an empty set called `seen` to store unique remainders.

3. **Looping through 1 to k**:
   - The program iterates from `1` to `k` inclusive.
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates `remainder = n % i`.

4. **Checking for Duplicates**:
   - If the `remainder` is already in `seen`, it prints "No" and exits the program, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If the `remainder` is not in `seen`, it adds the `remainder` to the set.

5. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints "Yes", indicating that all remainders are distinct.

### Key Considerations:

- **Correctness for Small k**: 
   - For small values of `k`, the program correctly computes and checks each remainder.
  
- **Correctness for Large k**: 
   - The approach of checking every number from `1` to `k` is not efficient when `k` is large (up to \(10^{18}\)). However, the problem description doesn't specify performance constraints, only correctness of the output. The program logically follows the requirements.

- **Special Cases**:
   - When `k = 1`, the only remainder is `n % 1`, which is always `0`, so the output is always "Yes".
   - Values of `n` and `k` being equal or one being significantly larger than the other do not change the distinctness of the remainder checks.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic outlined in the problem description. It checks for distinct remainders for values from `1` to `k`, adheres to input constraints, and produces the expected output based on the conditions set.

Correctness: **True**
