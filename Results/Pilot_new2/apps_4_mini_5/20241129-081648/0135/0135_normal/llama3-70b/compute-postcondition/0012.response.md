The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. No variables are modified, and the program does not continue to any further operations or assignments. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values, but it indicates that the program has been exited.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen` now contains the value of `remainder`; the program exits.**
