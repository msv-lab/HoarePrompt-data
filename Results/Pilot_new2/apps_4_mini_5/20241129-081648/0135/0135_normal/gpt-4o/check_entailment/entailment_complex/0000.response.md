Correctness: **False**

The function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all remainders \( n \mod i \) (for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \)) are distinct for all possible values of \( n \) and \( k \). 

Here's why it fails:

1. **Handling the case where \( k \geq n \)**: The function returns 'No' immediately when \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \). This is not accurate, because when \( k \) is greater than \( n \), the remainder \( n \mod k \) will always be \( n \) for \( k > n \) and could lead to distinct remainders for \( i < n \). The function incorrectly assumes that having \( k \) greater than or equal to \( n \) automatically implies non-distinctness.

2. **Remainders when \( k < n \)**: While it checks for distinct remainders in the loop, it does not account for the fact that certain ranges of \( k \) (especially when \( k \) is close to \( n \)) could also have unique remainders. The function must analyze the remainders more comprehensively across the entire specified range instead of immediately discarding possibilities based on \( k \) alone.

For example, consider the input \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 10 \). The remainders will be:
- \( n \mod 1 = 0 \)
- \( n \mod 2 = 0 \)
- \( n \mod 3 = 1 \)
- \( n \mod 4 = 2 \)
- \( n \mod 5 = 0 \)
- \( n \mod 6 = 4 \)
- \( n \mod 7 = 3 \)
- \( n \mod 8 = 2 \)
- \( n \mod 9 = 1 \)
- \( n \mod 10 = 0 \)

Here, we can see that some remainders repeat, and thus the answer should be 'No', which is handled correctly by the function. However, the function will incorrectly return 'No' for any \( k \geq n \), without checking the distinctness.

In conclusion, the algorithm's assumption about the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \) is flawed, leading to incorrect conclusions in cases where \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \). This constitutes a break from the problem description's requirement for handling all integers \( i \) from \( 1 \) to \( k \).
