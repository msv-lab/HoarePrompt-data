According to the code, the loop executes for values of `i` from 1 to `k` inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is some integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to `i`. Since `k` is less than or equal to 10^18 and greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, if `i` is increased by 1, `i` will be 2. Also, `k` remains the same as it is not altered within the loop's condition.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` is less than `n`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 0, `remainder` is in `seen_remainders` now**.
