To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic step by step and check if it covers all possible scenarios as described.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   ```python
   (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
   (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
   ```

2. **Calculating the Floor and Block**:
   - The floor of apartment `a` is calculated as:
     ```python
     a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
     ```
   - The block (or подъезд) of apartment `a` is calculated as:
     ```python
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```
   - Similarly, the floor and block of apartment `b` are calculated.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Block Time**:
   - The time to move between blocks is calculated based on the modular nature of the building:
     ```python
     min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
     ```

4. **Calculating the Minimum Floor Time**:
   - The code checks if `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, and calculates the floor transition time accordingly:
     ```python
     if a_floor > b_floor:
         min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
     else:
         min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
     ```

5. **Final Output**:
   - Finally, it sums the two times:
     ```python
     print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
     ```

### Potential Issues:

1. **Floor Time Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `min_floor_time` assumes that whether `a_floor` is greater or lesser, the lift has already been called and it waits for 10 seconds. However, if Edward's starting floor is the same as Natasha's, he should not be adding the 10 seconds of lift wait time because he can go directly without needing the lift.
   - The condition for calculating the floor movement time does not consider the scenario where both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `a` and `b` could be on the same floor; in such cases, the time should be zero for floor transition, but the current implementation would incorrectly add time for the lift (10 seconds).

### Example of Incorrect Handling:
- Consider the case where:
  - `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 5`
  - `a = 1`, `b = 2`
  - Both occupy the same floor (1), but the code would incorrectly calculate additional lift wait time.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly handle certain edge cases as described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect time calculations. 

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.
