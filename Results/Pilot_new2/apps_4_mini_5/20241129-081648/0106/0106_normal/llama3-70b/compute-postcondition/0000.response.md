The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values based on the input provided through `input().split()`, which is then mapped to integers. The specific values for `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown since they depend on the input. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, where `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from the input.**
