Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are integers equal to the first and second input values respectively; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1` and `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_block_time` is equal to `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`; if `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is equal to `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`; otherwise, `min_floor_time` is equal to `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
