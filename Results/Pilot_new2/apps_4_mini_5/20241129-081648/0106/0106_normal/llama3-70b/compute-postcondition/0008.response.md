Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an integer equal to the first input value; `b` is an integer equal to the second input value; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is equal to `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is equal to `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10; the current value of `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.**
