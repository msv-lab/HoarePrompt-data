The code assigns values to `a` and `b` by taking input values and mapping them to integers. The precondition states that `a` and `b` are integers within certain bounds based on the product of `n`, `m`, and `k`. After executing the code, `a` and `b` will hold the values provided as input, while `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an integer equal to the first input value; `b` is an integer equal to the second input value.**
