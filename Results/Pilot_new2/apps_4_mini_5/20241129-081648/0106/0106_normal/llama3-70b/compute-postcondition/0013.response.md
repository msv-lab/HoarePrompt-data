The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the given definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers such that their values are between 1 and the product of `n`, `m`, and `k`, ensuring that `a` is not equal to `b`. 

Since the output specifics are missing, I will assume a generic output based on common patterns in function behavior. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` may involve processing or validating these constraints in some manner, but as the outputs are not provided, I cannot specify exact return values.

Functionality: **The function has no explicit parameters but operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000), and a and b are integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k) with a not equal to b. The function's specific return value is not defined.**
