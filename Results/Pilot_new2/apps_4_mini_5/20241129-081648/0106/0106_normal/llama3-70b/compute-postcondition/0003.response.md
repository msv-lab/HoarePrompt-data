`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this calculation. The new value of `a_block` depends on the specific values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, but it signifies the number of full blocks that fit into `a`. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an integer equal to the first input value; `b` is an integer equal to the second input value; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
