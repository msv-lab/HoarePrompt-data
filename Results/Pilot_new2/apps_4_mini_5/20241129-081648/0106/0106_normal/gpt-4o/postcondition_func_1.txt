The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the block and floor number of the apartment within a building organized in `m` blocks and `k` floors per block. It returns the calculated block and floor numbers. The code does not account for edge cases such as invalid apartment numbers (e.g., numbers less than 1) or apartments that exceed the total number of apartments that can exist given `n`, `m`, and `k`.
