To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and the implementation of the function.

### Analysis of the Problem Description
1. **Inputs**: The program must accept three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of blocks, the number of floors per block, and the number of apartments per floor, respectively. It also needs two integers `a` and `b`, representing the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha.
2. **Location Calculation**: The apartment numbers must be translated into their respective block (entrance) and floor numbers.
3. **Time Calculation**: The program must compute the minimum time it takes for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment, considering:
   - Time to descend to the first floor (if not already there) using the lift.
   - Time to walk between blocks (entrances).
   - Time to ascend to the target floor.

### Analysis of the Program
- **Function `get_location(apartment)`**: This function correctly computes the block and floor numbers based on the apartment number. The formulas used match the description of how apartments are numbered.
- **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
  - It first retrieves Edward's block and floor using `get_location`.
  - It calculates the time needed to exit to the first floor, which is correct as it considers both the lift wait time and the time taken to descend.
  - It calculates the direct and reverse walking time between blocks, considering the circular structure of the building.
  - Finally, it computes the time taken to reach Natashaâ€™s floor and sums up the total time.

### Potential Issues
Upon careful examination, the program seems to correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. However, there is a small detail that could potentially lead to misleading results:
- The `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` calculations do not account for the fact that if Edward is in the last block and needs to go to the first block, the walking time should also consider the circular nature properly. However, the calculation does use modulo, which seems to handle this case.

### Conclusion
Given that:
- The calculations for timing seem to align with the problem description.
- The function accurately retrieves the block and floor.
- The circular nature of the building is considered in a way that would yield correct results for walking between blocks.

Thus, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
