To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we will follow the specified process:

The initial conditions are:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k (a ≠ b).
- If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is equal to `10 + (floor_a - 1)`, which is greater than or equal to 11.
- `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.

The code snippet:
```
reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
```

Analysis of the code:
1. The variable `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b`.
2. The expression `(n - abs(block_a - block_b))` computes the distance in the reverse direction, adjusted by the modulo operation with `n`, and scaled by 15.

Since no specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, or the result of the calculation are provided, we will keep the expression that represents `reverse_walk_time`. 

The other variables' values remain unchanged in this context, so we include all the initial state information.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k (a ≠ b); if `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0, otherwise `time_to_exit` is equal to `10 + (floor_a - 1)` which is greater than or equal to 11; `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is equal to `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
