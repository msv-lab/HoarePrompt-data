Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k (a ≠ b). If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `floor_a` is not equal to 1, and `time_to_exit` is equal to `10 + (floor_a - 1)` which is greater than or equal to 11.***
