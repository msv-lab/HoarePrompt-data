    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k (a ≠ b). If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `floor_a` is not equal to 1, and `time_to_exit` is equal to `10 + (floor_a - 1)` which is greater than or equal to 11.

    #The program returns total_time which is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor based on the calculations for given values of floor_a, block_a, block_b, and floor_b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two integer parameters `a` and `b`, where `1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k` with `a ≠ b`. It calculates the total time required to exit from the floor of location `a` to the floor of location `b`, which includes the time to exit the current floor if not on the ground floor, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time taken to reach the target floor. The function returns this total time as an integer.

    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #The program returns block and floor, where block is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and floor is calculated as floor_within_block // k + 1, based on the values of apartment, m, and k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the block and floor number of the apartment within a building organized in `m` blocks and `k` floors per block. It returns the calculated block and floor numbers. The code does not account for edge cases such as invalid apartment numbers (e.g., numbers less than 1) or apartments that exceed the total number of apartments that can exist given `n`, `m`, and `k`.
