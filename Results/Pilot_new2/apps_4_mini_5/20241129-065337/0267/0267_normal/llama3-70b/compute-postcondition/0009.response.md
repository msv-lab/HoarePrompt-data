The variable `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `9`. The initial state specifies that the pair `(n, k)` is not present in `dp`, but after the assignment, it becomes present with the value `9`. The other variables `l`, `r`, and any conditions regarding their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10 and not equal to 0, the pair `(n, k)` is now present in `dp` with the value `9`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 10.**
