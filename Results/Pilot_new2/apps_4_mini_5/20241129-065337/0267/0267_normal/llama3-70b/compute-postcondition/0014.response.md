According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 3.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**
