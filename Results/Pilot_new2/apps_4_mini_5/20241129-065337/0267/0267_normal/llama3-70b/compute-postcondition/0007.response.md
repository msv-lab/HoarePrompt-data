The value of `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `n`. The previous information states that the pair `(n, k)` is not present in `dp`, indicating that this assignment is a new entry in the `dp` dictionary. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `k` is not equal to 0, and `dp[n, k]` is `n`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `k` is not equal to 0, `(n, k)` is now present in `dp` with `dp[n, k] = n`**
