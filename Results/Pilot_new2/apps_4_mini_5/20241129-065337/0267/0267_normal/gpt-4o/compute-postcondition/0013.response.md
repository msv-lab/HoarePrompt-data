The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). The function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all `num` values in the range from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true. If no values satisfy the condition of `func_1(num, k)`, then `total_sum` remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to compute the total sum of valid numbers within a specified range that meet a certain condition defined by another function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all numbers in the range from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true. If no numbers satisfy this condition, it returns 0.**
