The variable `total_sum` is initialized to `0`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this operation, and they remain within their specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0.**
