According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 1` if the condition in `func_1(num, k)` was true. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Given that `num` is currently `l + 1`, the next value of `num` would be `l + 2`.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, the value of `r` must be greater than or equal to `l + 2`.

State: **`l`, `r`, and `k` are unchanged, and `r` must be greater than or equal to `l + 2`**.
