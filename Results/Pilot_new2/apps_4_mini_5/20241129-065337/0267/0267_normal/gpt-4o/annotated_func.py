#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(n, k):

    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the number of unique digits in the string representation of n is less than or equal to k, where n is an integer within the range [l, r].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and returns a boolean indicating whether the number of unique digits in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. The function works for any integer `n`, regardless of its specific range, as long as `n` is a valid integer.

If no values satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, then `total_sum` remains 0.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum, which is equal to the sum of all num values in the range from l to r for which func_1(num, k) returns true. If no values satisfy func_1(num, k), then total_sum remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` (where 1 <= l <= r < 10^18) and an integer `k` (where 1 <= k <= 10). It returns the sum of all integers in the range from `l` to `r` for which the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true. If no numbers satisfy this condition, the function returns 0. The sum is computed modulo a defined constant `MOD`.
