Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the range \( l \) to \( r \) is very large, especially up to \( 10^{18} \). The `for num in range(l, r + 1)` line will create an iterator over potentially \( 10^{18} \) numbers, which is not feasible in terms of time and memory consumption.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1000000000000000000 2
```
The program attempts to check each number from 1 to \( 10^{18} \), which will lead to a time complexity that is not manageable.

Additionally, it does not handle edge cases where \( k \) is large enough to allow all digits. It simply checks whether the number of distinct digits in the number is less than or equal to \( k \), but this does not seem to be optimized for large ranges. 

Therefore, due to the inefficiency and impracticality for large inputs, the solution does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
