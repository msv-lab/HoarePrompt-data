Correctness: **False**.

The provided program checks if the string `s` contains the sequence of characters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' as a subsequence. However, it does not account for the requirement to replace characters in the string to form the target string. For example, if the input string is "aaa", the program would incorrectly output `-1`, but we could replace the first 'a' to 'b', the second 'a' to 'c', and so on to eventually get "abc" as a subsequence (even though it doesn't fully form 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz').

Additionally, a case like "aabbcc" would also lead to `-1`, while we could still replace the 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's to achieve the desired subsequence.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
