Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle cases where the string `s` can be modified to include the sequence 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' as a subsequence, but the characters in `s` are not in the correct order or are missing characters that can be converted to the necessary letters. 

For example, consider the input:
```
s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstu"
```
In this case, the program will return `-1`, but it is possible to transform this string into the target by changing 'n', 'o', and 'p' to 'v', 'w', and 'x' respectively, thus including the entire alphabet as a subsequence.

Additionally, the program does not account for the fact that characters can be replaced to eventually form a contiguous subsequence of the target string. The algorithm only checks for a direct match of characters in order but misses out on potential transformations that could fulfill the requirement.

Thus, the program fails to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.
