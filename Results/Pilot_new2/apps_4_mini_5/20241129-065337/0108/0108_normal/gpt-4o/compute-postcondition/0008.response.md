The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The value of `j` remains unchanged because the condition regarding `s[i]` being equal to 'a' does not affect `j` during this increment operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains unchanged.**
