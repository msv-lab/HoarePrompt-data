The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that the length of `s` is greater than `i + 1`, which means `i` is still within bounds after the increment. The value of `j` is not affected by this operation, and remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented by 1; `j` remains unchanged and less than `target_len`.**
