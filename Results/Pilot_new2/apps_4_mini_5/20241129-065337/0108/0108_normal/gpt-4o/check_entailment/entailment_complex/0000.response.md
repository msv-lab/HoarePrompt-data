Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the program must allow transforming any character in the string to the next character in alphabetical order (with 'z' being the endpoint), and it should be possible to form the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" as a subsequence. 

However, the program only checks if the characters of the input string `s` already contain all the characters of the target string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" in order. It does not account for the possibility of transforming characters in `s` to meet the requirement of forming the target string as a subsequence. 

For example:
- Given the input "aacceeggiikkmmooqqssuuwwyy", while the program would print "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" directly, it fails to consider that some letters could potentially be transformed into lower letters needed to fill gaps in the sequence.

- A string like "aabbccddeeffgg" would output "-1", even though it could be transformed to "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" with sufficient moves using the allowed transformations.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description accurately, which allows for transformations, making its correctness evaluation **False**.
