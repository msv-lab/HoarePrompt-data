The code appends the value of `char` to `res`. Given the initial state, `s` must include the new value of `char`, which is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. This means that `char` has been incremented by 1 in its ASCII value before being used. However, since `res` is undefined prior to this code snippet, we do not know its previous value. 

Assuming `res` is initially an empty string or has some previous value, after executing the code, `res` will now also include the incremented character `char`. 

Output State: **`s` must include the new value of `char` (which is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`), `res` is updated to include `char`.**
