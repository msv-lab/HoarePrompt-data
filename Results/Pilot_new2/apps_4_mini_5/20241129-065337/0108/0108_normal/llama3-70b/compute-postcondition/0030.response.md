The value of `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. Since it is given that `res` includes `char`, this means that `char` is already present in `res`, and the operation simply adds another instance of `char` to `res`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` must have contained at least 2 occurrences of `char`, `s` must contain `char`, `res` includes at least one more occurrence of `char`.

Output State: **`s` must have contained at least 2 occurrences of `char`, `s` must contain `char`, `res` includes at least one more occurrence of `char`**.
