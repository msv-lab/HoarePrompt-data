To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to evaluate the state before the loop starts and the loop's requirements.

1. The loop iterates over `alphabet`, which is a fixed string containing all lowercase English letters (`'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`).
2. The loop will execute once for each character in `alphabet`, which has 26 characters.
3. The variable `char` will take on each letter of `alphabet` during the loop's execution.

Given this understanding, we can see that the loop will execute regardless of the values of `s` and `res`, as they do not affect the execution of the loop over `alphabet`. However, we need to establish the initial state of the loop variable `char`.

At the start of the loop, `char` needs to be set to the first character of `alphabet`, which is `'a'`. 

Thus, the relevant states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length in the range [1, 100000], `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
