Postcondition: ***`s` is an empty string. If `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char` is 'z', and the length of `res` is 26. Otherwise, `res` is empty, `char` is 'z' if the original `s` contained characters from 'a' to 'z', and if the original `s` did not contain any characters, `s` remains unchanged, while the length of `res` is less than 26, and -1 is printed.***
