To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program.

The problem states that Nikolay has a certain quantity of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`), and he wants to create a compote in the ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. The goal is to find the maximum total number of fruits that can be used while respecting this ratio.

The program does the following:
1. It reads three integers from input: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used, which is determined by the limiting ingredient based on the required ratios:
   - `a` lemons can be used as is.
   - `b // 2` gives the maximum lemons based on the apples available because each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - `c // 4` gives the maximum lemons based on the pears available because each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. The minimum of these three values (`max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`) is calculated to ensure that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available fruits based on their respective ratios.
4. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits used as `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which correctly sums the total number of lemons, apples, and pears based on the calculated number of lemons.

Let's consider some edge cases:
- If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 4`, it should return `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is correct.
- If `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, since there aren't enough pears (as 4 pears are needed for 1 lemon), it should return `0`, which the program correctly handles by calculating `max_lemons` as `0`.
- If `a = 1`, `b = 3`, and `c = 5`, the output should be `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which the program would also correctly return.

Now, checking if there are any potential cases where the program does not work as expected:
1. If we take `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`, technically violating the requirement of positive integers, but since the range is from 1 to 1000, this case does not apply.

After analyzing the problem statement and the program:
- The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use while adhering to the specified ratios for all valid input values.

Therefore, the final conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
