In the given code, `c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as their values are not affected by this code line. The initial state indicates that `c` is a positive integer, but after running the code, `c` will be defined specifically as the integer value from the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the newly defined variable `c`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
