In the provided code, `total_fruits` is calculated based on the value of `max_lemons`. The formula used is `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which can be simplified to `total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, resulting in `total_fruits = max_lemons * 7`.

The variable `max_lemons` is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. Since `b` is a positive integer and equal to the input integer, `b // 2` will be equal to `a // 2` or less, depending on the value of `a`. The value of `c // 4` depends on the input integer `c`.

Thus, `max_lemons` will take the minimum value between `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, which means it will be a non-negative integer.

After calculating `total_fruits`, its value will be `max_lemons * 7`, where `max_lemons` is determined by the inputs.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer (equal to the input integer), `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`; `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`.**
