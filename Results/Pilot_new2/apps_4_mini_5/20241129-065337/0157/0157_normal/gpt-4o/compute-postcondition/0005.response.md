To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the impact of `print(total_fruits)`.

Given:
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a positive integer (equal to the input integer `a`).
- `c` is an input integer.
- `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.
- `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

The `print(total_fruits)` statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`, but it does not modify any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged with respect to the calculations that define them, apart from the output.

The output of `print(total_fruits)` is the value of `total_fruits`, which is based on the calculation of `max_lemons`. 

As `total_fruits` is derived from `max_lemons`, which depends on the minimum of the three values (`a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`), we express this in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is equal to `a`, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is equal to `min(a, a // 2, c // 4)`, `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`, and the value of `total_fruits` is printed.**
