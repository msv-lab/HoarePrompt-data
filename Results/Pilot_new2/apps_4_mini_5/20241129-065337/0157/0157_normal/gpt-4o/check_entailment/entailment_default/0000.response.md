The program provided is intended to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to create a compote based on the specific ratio of 1:2:4. The code calculates how many complete sets of fruit can be made given the number of each fruit available.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program first calculates `max_lemons` using the formula:
   ```python
   max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
   ```
   This correctly computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the number of apples and pears available, as 2 apples and 4 pears are required for each lemon.

2. The total number of fruits used is calculated as:
   ```python
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
   This correctly sums 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears for each complete set represented by `max_lemons`.

3. Finally, the result is printed. 

### Edge Cases:
- If Nikolay has no lemons, apples, or pears that meet the required ratio, the program should return 0. The code does seem to handle this correctly since if `max_lemons` is 0, the output will also be 0.

- The program assumes that the inputs will be valid as per the problem description (positive integers) but does not handle any invalid inputs. However, since the problem constraints guarantee valid inputs, this is acceptable.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe that the function calculates the maximum possible number of sets of fruit that can be made based on the inputs, and the total number of fruits used in these sets is printed. They also note that certain situations where the maximum number of sets is zero are not handled.

The output hints agree with the logic of the code, as they both conclude that if there are not enough fruits to create even one set, the result will be 0.

### Final Assessment:
After reviewing the code and considering the edge cases, it appears that the program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case described. The hints provided confirm that the logic aligns with the expected outcomes dictated by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
