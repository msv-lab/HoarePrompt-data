Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It follows these steps:

1. It reads the input values for the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the required ratio of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. This is achieved by taking the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`),
   - The number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`), which gives the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the apples available,
   - The number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`), which gives the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with the pears available.

3. The total number of fruits used is then calculated by multiplying the number of complete sets of lemons by the total number of fruits in one set (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears = 7 fruits).

4. Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits used.

This logic ensures that the program correctly adheres to the constraints of whole fruits and the specified ratio, thus producing the correct output for all valid input cases. The program handles edge cases, including scenarios where not enough fruits are available to make even a single complete set of the compote (resulting in a total output of 0).

Thus, the program meets all the conditions set forth in the problem description, confirming its correctness.
