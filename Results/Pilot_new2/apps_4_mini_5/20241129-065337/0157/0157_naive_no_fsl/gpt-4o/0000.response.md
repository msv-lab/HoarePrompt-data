Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the ratio of 1:2:4 according to the available quantities of each fruit.

1. The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote, which is constrained by:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`),
   - The number of apples, which must be at least double the number of lemons (`b // 2`), and
   - The number of pears, which must be at least four times the number of lemons (`c // 4`).
3. It calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote by multiplying the number of lemons by 1, apples by 2, and pears by 4.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used.

The program handles the edge cases as well:
- If there are not enough fruits to make even one complete set, it correctly computes and returns 0.
- The logic ensures that fractions of fruits are not used, adhering to the problem's requirements.

Tests with example inputs show expected outputs:
- For input `2, 5, 7`, the output is `7`, which is correct.
- For input `4, 7, 13`, the output is `21`, which is correct.
- For input `2, 3, 2`, the output is `0`, which is correct.

Thus, the logic is sound and aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
