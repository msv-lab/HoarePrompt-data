Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values indicating which cubes have been used based on the presence of `digit` in the respective `cube_faces`, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, and `found` is False. This means that no cube was used, resulting in `used_cubes` remaining as initially set to [False] * n.***
