The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2 if `i` is 1 or greater than 3 if `i` is 2; `used_cubes` at index `i` is set to `True`; `found` is True; `i` is 2 or 3; `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits; `used_cubes[i]` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
