Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 3 if `i` is 2 or greater than 4 if `i` is 3; `used_cubes` at index `i` is still set to `True`; `found` is True; `i` is 3 or 4; `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits. If `used_cubes[i]` is not set and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
