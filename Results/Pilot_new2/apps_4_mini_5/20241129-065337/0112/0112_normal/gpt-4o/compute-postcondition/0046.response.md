According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` that are being iterated over. The loop will execute again for the next digit in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the last cube checked (0, 1, or 2), and `found` is True indicating that a cube has been successfully matched with the previous digit.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, if `i` is currently 2 (the last checked index), the loop will not execute again because there are no more cubes to check. If `i` is 1, the loop can execute one more time for the index 2. If `i` is 0, it can execute for the index 1 and then index 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1, and we will also need to have at least three digits in the `digits` list if `i` is 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` indicates which cubes have been used based on the presence of `digit` in the respective `cube_faces`, `found` is True, and `i` is 2 (if `i` was previously 1) or `i` is 1 (if `i` was previously 0), `digits` must have at least `i + 1` digits**.
