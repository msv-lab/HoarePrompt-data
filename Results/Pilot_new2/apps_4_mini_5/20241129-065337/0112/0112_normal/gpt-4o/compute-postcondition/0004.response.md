According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Given that `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once, as long as `n` is initialized correctly within this range. 

The state variables `used_cubes` and `found` do not prevent the loop from executing but may change during the loop iterations. The variable `i` will be initialized at 0 before the loop starts and will iterate up to `n - 1`.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes properly, we must confirm that `n` is set within the specified range and that `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to [False] * n, `digits` must be a non-empty iterable, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
