According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `n` is such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3\), it indicates that the loop has executed for some value of `i` that is less than `n`. 

If `n` is 3, the loop has run for `i` values `0`, `1`, and `2`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be `3`. Therefore, `n` must remain `3` in this case. 

If `n` is 2, the loop has run for `i` values `0` and `1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be `2`, meaning `n` must be at least `2`.

If `n` is `1`, the loop has run for `i` value `0`, so for it to run one more time, `i` would need to be `1`, which requires `n` to be at least `1`.

In summary, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 and thus will be equal to the current value of `i + 1`, while `n` must be at least equal to this new value of `i + 1` in order for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values where `used_cubes[n]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` remains unchanged, `i` is the next value (which is currently `i + 1`, thus it will be 1 if previously `i` was 0, 2 if `i` was 1, or 3 if `i` was 2).**
