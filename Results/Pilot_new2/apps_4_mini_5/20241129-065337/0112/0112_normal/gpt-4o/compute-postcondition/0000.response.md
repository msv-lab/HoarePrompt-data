The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implied that it should be derived from the input context, likely related to the integer values representing the cubes' digits. The code converts `num` to a string and then creates a list of its digits. Since `num` is not explicitly specified, we cannot provide the exact output for `digits`.

However, assuming `num` is defined and falls within the range of digits represented by the cubes, the output state will reflect that `digits` now contains a list of string representations of the digits in `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and each of the next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the digits on the faces of the cubes; `digits` is a list of strings representing the digits of `num`.**
