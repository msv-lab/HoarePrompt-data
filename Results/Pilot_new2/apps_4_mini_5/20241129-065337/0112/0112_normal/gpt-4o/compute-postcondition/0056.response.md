The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, but it is already `True` from the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged as the value of `found` does not change.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2 if `i` is 1 or greater than 3 if `i` is 2; `used_cubes` at index `i` is set to `True`; `found` is True; `i` is 2 or 3; `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits; `used_cubes[i]` is `True`.**
