Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `used_cubes[n]` is True. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is now True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` is True, and `i` is 1 if it was 0, 2 if it was 1, or 3 if it was 2, exiting the most internal loop or if statement.***
