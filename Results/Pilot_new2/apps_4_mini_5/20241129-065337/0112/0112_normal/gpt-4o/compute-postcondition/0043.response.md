Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` indicates which cubes have been used based on the presence of `digit` in the respective `cube_faces`, `found` is False (indicating that no cube was found that matched the conditions), and `i` is the index of the last cube checked (0, 1, or 2). The state of `used_cubes` remains unchanged.***
