Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to [True] + [False] * (n-1) indicating the first cube is now used, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, and `found` is True when `not used_cubes[i]` is True and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. If the condition is not met, `used_cubes` remains unchanged and no updates are made to `found`.***
