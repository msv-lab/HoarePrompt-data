Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is now True, `i` is 0, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` holds true, the program sets `found` to True and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
