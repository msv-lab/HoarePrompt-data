The value of `found` is assigned to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values with the last element set to True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values with the last element set to True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` is True, and `i` is `n`.**
