The line of code `used_cubes[i] = True` changes the value at index `i` of the `used_cubes` list to `True`. Since `i` will be the next value based on its previous state, which can be 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial value of `i`, this means that one of the elements in `used_cubes` at the index corresponding to the current value of `i` is being updated to `True`. 

We know that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, meaning the possible values for `n` are 1, 2, or 3. Consequently, `used_cubes` could be of size at least 4 to accommodate indexing from 0 to 3, and the boolean value at index `n` is already `True`. The state of `found` remains unchanged, and `i` is now incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[n]` is True, `used_cubes[i]` is now True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` remains unchanged, and `i` is the next value (1 if it was 0, 2 if it was 1, or 3 if it was 2).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[n]` is True, `used_cubes[i]` is now True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` remains unchanged, `i` is the next value (1 if it was 0, 2 if it was 1, or 3 if it was 2).**
