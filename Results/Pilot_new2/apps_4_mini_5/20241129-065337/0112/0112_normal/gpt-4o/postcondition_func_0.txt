The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of lists `cubes`. It calculates the maximum integer `x` that can be formed using the integers on the cube faces, returning `1` if `n` is `1`, `2` if `n` is `2`, and `3` if `n` is `3`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range of `1` to `3`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
