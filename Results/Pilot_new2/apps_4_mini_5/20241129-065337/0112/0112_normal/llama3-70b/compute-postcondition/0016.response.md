Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lines of input, each containing exactly 6 integers (ranging from 0 to 9). It extracts all the digits from these inputs, forming a set of unique digits. If the digit '0' is present, it is removed from this set. The function then constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order and concatenating them. This integer is printed as output, but the function does not return any value.**
