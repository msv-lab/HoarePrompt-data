The code assigns `max_num` the value obtained by joining the sorted string representations of all integers in `cubes`, sorted in reverse order. Given that `digits` excludes the string '0', `max_num` will be the maximum number that can be formed by the digits available in `digits`. 

The values of the variables that are not directly affected remain unchanged, while `max_num` is computed based on the values in `digits`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing exactly `n` lists of integers; if '0' is in `digits`, then `digits` is the set of string representations of all integers in all lists within `cubes` excluding the string '0'; `max_num` is an integer equal to the maximum number formed by the digits in `digits`.
