According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 2 lists, the loop can execute again for the second list in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 3, `cubes` contains `n` lists, and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`. Since `cube` is the first list, for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 2 lists, and `cube` should be updated to the second list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers, `digits` is updated to include the string representations of the integers in `cube`, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`.**
