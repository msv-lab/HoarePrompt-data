The variable `digits` is initialized as an empty set. The previous states of `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged, and the initialization of `digits` does not depend on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from input; `digits` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from input; `digits` is an empty set.**
