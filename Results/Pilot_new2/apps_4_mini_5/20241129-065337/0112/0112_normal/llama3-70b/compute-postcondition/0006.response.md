The code snippet updates `digits` to include the string representations of the integers in `cube`. Since `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, the values of `cube` are used to generate new string values for `digits`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 3, and that `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers.

After the execution of the code, `digits` will include new string representations for each integer in `cube`. The output does not change the values of `n`, `cubes`, or `cube`, but it modifies `digits` by adding new values to it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list containing at least 2 lists of integers, `digits` is updated to include the string representations of the integers in `cube`, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`.**
