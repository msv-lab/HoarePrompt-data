The given problem is to determine whether a specific integer \( b \) appears in an arithmetic sequence starting at \( a \) with a difference of \( c \). The program implements this logic by checking if \( c \) is zero and handles that case separately.

### Initial Assessment
1. If \( c = 0 \):
   - The sequence is constant and all elements are \( a \). The program correctly checks if \( a \) equals \( b \) and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
   
2. If \( c \neq 0 \):
   - The program checks if the difference \( (b - a) \) is divisible by \( c \) and also whether the result of \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative. This is correct as it ensures that not only does \( b \) lie in the sequence, but it also must occur in the future terms (i.e., \( i \) must be a positive integer).

### Edge Cases
- The edge case of \( c = 0 \) is handled correctly.
- For \( c > 0 \), \( b \) must be greater than or equal to \( a \) in order for it to appear in the sequence.
- For \( c < 0 \), \( b \) must be less than or equal to \( a \) to appear in the sequence.

### Output Hints Check
The output hints correctly describe the function's behavior. They explain how the function checks for each condition and what it prints based on those checks. The hints agree with the code's logic and confirm that it checks all necessary conditions.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and accounts for both edge cases and normal cases. There are no examples from the output hints or the provided input-output cases that demonstrate incorrect behavior.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code accurately determines if \( b \) appears in the sequence defined by \( a \) and \( c \), handling both the zero and non-zero cases for \( c \) correctly.
