The code snippet simply prints the string 'NO'. It does not change any values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`, and no calculations or assignments are made that would affect their states. The conditions provided in the initial state remain true after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers satisfying -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, and `c` is not equal to 0. The expression `((b - a) % c == 0)` is false, and either `((b - a) / c < 0)` or `((b - a) % c != 0)`, and 'NO' is printed.**
