The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` through user input. It prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `a`. If `c` is 0 and `b` is not equal to `a`, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and non-negative; if both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This function handles edge cases where `c` is zero and checks for divisibility and non-negativity in relation to the difference between `b` and `a`.
