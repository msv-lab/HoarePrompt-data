Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with `-10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed to the console. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is 0, it reflects that `c` is currently 0. If `c` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, otherwise 'NO' is printed.***
