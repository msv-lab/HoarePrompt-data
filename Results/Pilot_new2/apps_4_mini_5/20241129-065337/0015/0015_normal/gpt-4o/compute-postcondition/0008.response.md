The code snippet provided executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged after this execution. The conditions of the variables stated in the initial state are still valid and maintain their defined relationships.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from input, with `-10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`, `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is not equal to 0. The value of `(b - a) % c` is equal to 0, and the value of `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0. The output is 'YES'.**
