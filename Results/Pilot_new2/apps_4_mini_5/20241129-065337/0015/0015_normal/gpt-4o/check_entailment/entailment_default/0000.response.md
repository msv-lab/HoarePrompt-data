The provided code aims to determine if a given integer `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference of `c`. Let's analyze the code based on the problem description and the output hints.

The code:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Initial Assessment:

1. **Checking if `b` is equal to `a`:** The first condition checks if `b` is the same as the starting element `a`. If true, it correctly outputs "YES".

2. **Checking if `c` is zero:** The second condition checks if the common difference `c` is zero. If `c` is zero and `b` is not equal to `a`, it outputs "NO". This is correct since when `c` is zero, the sequence does not progress and only contains the element `a`.

3. **Check for divisibility and non-negativity:** The third condition checks two things:
   - If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`.
   - If that difference is non-negative when divided by `c`.

   This is correct as it determines whether the element `b` can be reached in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`. 

### Edge Cases and Output Hints:

- **When `c` is positive:** If `c` is positive, the sequence will increase indefinitely. In this case, if `b` is less than `a`, it should return "NO", which the code handles correctly.

- **When `c` is negative:** If `c` is negative, the sequence will decrease indefinitely. If `b` is greater than `a`, it should return "NO", which is not explicitly checked in code but is covered in the condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` because if `c` is negative and `b > a`, this condition would evaluate to `False`.

- **When `c` is zero and `b` equals `a`:** This edge case is handled correctly because it checks for equality first and would output "YES".

### Output Hints Validation:

The output hints state that:
- The function prints "YES" if `b` is equal to `a`.
- If `c` is 0 and `b` is not equal to `a`, it prints "NO".
- If `c` is not equal to 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and non-negative.

These hints correctly align with the logic in the code. 

### Conclusion:

I canâ€™t find any potential cases that the program does not handle correctly based on the problem description and the output hints provided. The code covers all scenarios described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**.
