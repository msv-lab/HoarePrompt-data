Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **When `c` is 0**: The sequence does not progress beyond the first element, which means all elements are equal to `a`. The program correctly checks if `a` equals `b` and prints "YES" if they are equal, otherwise "NO". This correctly handles the case where `b` could be equal to the first element.

2. **When `c` is non-zero**: The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to confirm that `b` can be expressed as an element of the arithmetic sequence. This condition ensures that `b` can be reached exactly from `a` by adding multiples of `c`. Furthermore, to ensure that `b` appears after `a` in the sequence, the program checks `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which means we only consider positive steps in the sequence.

3. **All given examples**: The program correctly handles all the provided examples and adheres to the conditions laid out in the problem description.

As I cannot find any cases where the program fails to provide the correct result, I conclude that the program is correct. Thus, the final determination is:

Correctness: **True**
