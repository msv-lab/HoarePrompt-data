#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the sum n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10), and b is a positive integer representing the count k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10).
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `n` and `k`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `n` and `k`, which is represented by `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, and it returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, ensuring it handles any positive integers within the specified range. There are no edge cases related to negative or zero values since both `a` and `b` are guaranteed to be positive integers.
