The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both parameters are positive integers, where `a` represents the sum `n` (with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10) and `b` represents the count `k` (with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10). After executing the function body, it returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the original values of `n` and `k`, represented by `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b` and return their GCD. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, both positive integers, and returns the GCD of a and b.**
