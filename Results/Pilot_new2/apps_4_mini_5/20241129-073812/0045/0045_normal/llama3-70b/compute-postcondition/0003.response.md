In the initial state, we have:

- `a` is a positive integer equal to `k`.
- `b` is a positive integer equal to `n % k`.
- `n` must not be a multiple of `k`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
a, b = b, a % b
```

Here, we will determine the new values of `a` and `b`:

1. The right-hand side of the assignment (`b, a % b`) will be evaluated first.
   - The new value of `a` will be equal to the current value of `b`, which is `n % k`.
   - The new value of `b` will be equal to the current value of `a % b`. Since `a` is `k` and `b` is `n % k`, we compute `k % (n % k)`.
   
2. Since `n` is not a multiple of `k`, `n % k` is a positive integer less than `k`, and `k % (n % k)` will yield a positive integer. 

Thus, after executing the code:

- `a` will become `n % k`.
- `b` will become `k % (n % k)`.

The output state will reflect these changes while maintaining the conditions:

Output State: **`a` is equal to `n % k`, `b` is equal to `k % (n % k)`, `n` must not be a multiple of `k`.**
