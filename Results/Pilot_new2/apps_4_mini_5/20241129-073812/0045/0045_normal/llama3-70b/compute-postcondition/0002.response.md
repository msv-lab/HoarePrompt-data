According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `b` is truthy, which means it must be non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is equal to `n % k`. Since `a` is a positive integer equal to `k`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` for `b` to potentially be non-zero. 

However, `b` could be zero if `n` is a multiple of `k`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted such that `n % k` is not zero. This means `n` must not be a multiple of `k`, which implies `n` can be adjusted to be any value that is not in the form of `m * k` for integers `m`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `n` is such that `b` (which is `n % k`) is greater than 0. 

State: **`a` is a positive integer equal to `k`; `b` is a positive integer equal to `n % k` and `n` must not be a multiple of `k`.**
