To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and analyze the program logic:

### Problem Requirements:
1. The function should create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers where the sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized.
3. If such a sequence cannot be formed, the function should return `-1`.

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   - The minimum sum for `k` strictly increasing positive integers (1, 2, ..., k) is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, the function correctly returns `-1` since it's impossible to form the sequence.

2. **Determine the Base Value for the Sequence**:
   - If a sequence is possible, the program calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which determines how many times we can scale the minimum sequence by `d`.

3. **Creating the Sequence**:
   - The program initializes the `sequence` using a list comprehension to create the base sequence scaled by `d`.
   - It then modifies the last elements of the sequence by distributing the `remainder` (which is `n - d * min_sum`) to maintain the strictly increasing property.

4. **Final Sequence Return**:
   - The generated sequence is returned, which is guaranteed to sum to `n` and be strictly increasing due to the way it is constructed.

### Analysis of Correctness:
- **Strictly Increasing**: The sequence is built from the base elements (1 through k), scaled by `d`, and then each element is adjusted upwards if there is a remainder, which preserves the strictly increasing nature.
  
- **Sum Equals n**: The sum is calculated as `d * min_sum + remainder`, which equals `n` because `remainder` accounts for any leftover value after scaling.
  
- **Maximal GCD**: The GCD of the sequence is determined by the common factor `d`, which maximizes the GCD among the elements.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all criteria outlined in the problem description. It accurately checks if a sequence can be formed, constructs it correctly while maintaining the necessary properties, and returns `-1` when applicable.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **True**
