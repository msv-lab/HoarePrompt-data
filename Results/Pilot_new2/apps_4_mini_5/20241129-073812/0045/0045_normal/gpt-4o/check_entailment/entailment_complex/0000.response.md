To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and maximize their greatest common divisor (GCD). 
   - If it's impossible to create such a sequence, we should return -1.

2. **Initial Check for Minimum Sum**:
   - The program calculates `min_sum` as the sum of the first `k` natural numbers: `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - It checks if `min_sum` exceeds `n`. If it does, the program correctly returns -1, as we cannot form a sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` in this case.

3. **Calculating the Sequence**:
   - If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the program proceeds to calculate `d`, which indicates how many times we can multiply the sequence by a certain base value.
   - The sequence is initially constructed as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which means each element is `d` multiplied by its position in the sequence (1 to `k`).
   - It then calculates the `remainder`, which is how much of `n` is left after accounting for the minimum sum.
   - The program then distributes this `remainder` across the sequence by incrementing the last elements.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program returns the sequence, which is structured to be strictly increasing since it starts from the smallest positive integers.

5. **GCD Consideration**:
   - Given that the sequence is formed by multiplying a base `d` and distributing the `remainder`, all numbers in the sequence will share a common factor of `d`. This ensures that the GCD of the sequence is maximized.

### Conclusion:
- The program handles the conditions outlined in the problem description correctly. 
- It checks for the feasibility of the sequence and constructs it in such a way that meets all requirements, including the sum and the strictly increasing condition.
- It also correctly returns -1 when it is impossible to create such a sequence.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
