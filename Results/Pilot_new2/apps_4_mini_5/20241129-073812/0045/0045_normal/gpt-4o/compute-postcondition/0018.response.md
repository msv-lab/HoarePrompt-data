According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the current value of `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, and since we broke out of the most internal loop, it indicates that the loop did not reach the condition where `i` would decrement further after performing its last iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `k - 2 - 1 = k - 3`. Thus, `i` will be equal to `k - 3`, and the loop can execute again as long as `k - 3` is greater than or equal to 0. 

Since `k` is a positive integer and must be at least 3 for `k - 3` to be valid, there are no other changes needed to the values of `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, or `sequence`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to `(n - d * min_sum) - 2`, `sequence` is equal to `[d * (1), d * (2), ..., d * (k-2) + 1, d * (k-1), d * (k) + 1]`, `i` is equal to `k - 3`**
