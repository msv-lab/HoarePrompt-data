According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop starts with `i` set to `k - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 on each iteration until it reaches -1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `k - 2`. The range for the loop is defined as `range(k - 1, -1, -1)`, so if `i` is `k - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `k - 2`. 

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`) do not necessarily change just because the loop is executing again; what matters is the value of `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to `(n - d * min_sum) - 1`, `sequence` is equal to `[d * (1), d * (2), ..., d * (k-1), d * (k) + 1]`, `i` is `k - 2`**
