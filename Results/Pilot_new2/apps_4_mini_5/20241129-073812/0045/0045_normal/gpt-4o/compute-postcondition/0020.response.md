Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
