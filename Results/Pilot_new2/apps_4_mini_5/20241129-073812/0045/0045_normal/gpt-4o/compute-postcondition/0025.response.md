The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). 

After executing the function body, the function behaves as follows:
- If the condition based on `min_sum` is met (where `min_sum` is greater than `n`), the function returns -1.
- Otherwise, the function returns a sequence, which is calculated based on `d`, `k`, and `initial_remainder`. Each element in this sequence is defined as \(d \times (i + 1) + (1 \text{ if } i < \text{initial_remainder else } 0)\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(k-1\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, returning -1 if a specific condition regarding `min_sum` is met, or else returning a calculated sequence based on the parameters `d`, `k`, and `initial_remainder`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and k, returns -1 if a condition related to min_sum is met; otherwise, it returns a sequence calculated based on d, k, and initial_remainder.**
