To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The problem requires calculating the probability of at least two out of `k` people sharing a birthday among `2^n` available days. The probability can be derived using combinatorial methods. The core steps include:

1. If `k > 2^n`, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is guaranteed to be `1` (or `A = 1`, `B = 1`).
2. If `k <= 2^n`, we need to compute the number of ways to assign birthdays to `k` people without any shared birthdays, and divide this by the total number of birthday assignments, which is `2^n` raised to the power of `k`.

Analyzing the program, let's break down the core steps:

- It calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 2 ** n`.
- It uses a loop to compute the numerator representing the successful outcomes where no two people share the same birthday, and the denominator represents the total outcomes.
- After calculating both, it computes the GCD to reduce the fraction to its simplest form.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling Large Numbers:** The program uses multiplication in the loop which could result in very large integers, especially given that `k` and `n` can both be as large as `10^18`. Python handles large integers but we need to check if it respects the limits of the problem and manages to keep the computations feasible.
  
2. **No Check for k > 2^n:** The program does not directly check if `k > total_days`. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, it should immediately return `1 1` instead of proceeding with the calculations.

3. **Modulo Operation:** The modulo operation is applied after reducing the fraction, which must be done carefully to ensure correctness.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Case 1:** Input `(1, 3)`. Here `total_days = 2^1 = 2`. Since `k = 3 > 2`, the expected output is `1 1`. However, the program would go through its loop and not return the correct output.
  
- **Case 2:** Input `(3, 2)`. Here `total_days = 2^3 = 8`. The expected output is `1 8`, which the program computes correctly.

- **Case 3:** Input `(4, 3)`. Here `total_days = 2^4 = 16`. The expected output is `23 128`, which the program computes correctly.

### Conclusion:
Since the program lacks the necessary check for `k > total_days`, it will not handle such cases correctly. Therefore, for certain inputs, especially when `k` is greater than `2^n`, the program will not produce the expected output.

Correctness: **False**.
