`gcd` is assigned the value of `math.gcd(numerator, denominator)`. Given the initial state, `numerator` is 0 since `k` is at least 3, and `denominator` is `2^k`, which is a positive integer. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 0 and any positive integer (in this case, `denominator`) is the positive integer itself. Therefore, `gcd` will be equal to `denominator`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numerator` is 0, `denominator` is `2^k`, `k` is at least 2, `gcd` is equal to `2^k`.**
