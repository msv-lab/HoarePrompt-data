The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. Given that `denominator` is initially 4 and `total_days` is 2, the new value of `denominator` becomes 4 * 2 = 8. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 8, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 2.

Output State: **`total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 8, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 2**.
