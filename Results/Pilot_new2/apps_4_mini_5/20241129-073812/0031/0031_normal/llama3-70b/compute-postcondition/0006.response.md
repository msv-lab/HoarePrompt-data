According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `k` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing. 

State: **`total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 2, `i` is 1, `k` must be at least 2**
