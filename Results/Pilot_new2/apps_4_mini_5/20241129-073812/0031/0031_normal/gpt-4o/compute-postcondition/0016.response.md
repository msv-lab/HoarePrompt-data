The variable `denominator` is updated based on the formula `denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD`. The previous value of `total_days` is `2^n`, and `MOD` is `1000003`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `denominator`, but it is modified by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking modulo `MOD`. 

Therefore, the output will reflect the updated value of `denominator`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is equal to (previous numerator * (2^n - 2)) % 1000003; `denominator` is updated to (denominator * total_days) % 1000003; `i` is 2.**
