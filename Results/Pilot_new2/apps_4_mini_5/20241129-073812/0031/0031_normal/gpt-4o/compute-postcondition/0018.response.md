In this case, the variable `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \); `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \); `MOD` is \( 1000003 \); `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \); `numerator` is equal to the product of \( (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003 \); `denominator` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \); `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`.**
