To analyze the code snippet provided, let's break down the initial state and the impact of the code.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \)
- `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \)
- `MOD` is \( 1000003 \)
- `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \)
- `numerator` is equal to the product of \( (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003 \)
- `denominator` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \)
- `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`
- `p_total` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \)
- `p_shared` is equal to \( (p_total - p_no_shared + 1000003) \mod 1000003 \)
- `A` is equal to `p_shared`
- `B` is equal to `p_total`
- `g` is assigned the value of `func_1(A, B)` which is returned.

After the execution of the code snippet `A //= g`, the value of `A` is updated by performing integer division of `A` by `g`.

Therefore, we must note that `A` now holds a new value, which is `A` divided by `g`. The other variables remain unchanged, and we do not have specific values for `g`, `A`, or `B` since they depend on the outcome of `func_1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \); `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \); `MOD` is \( 1000003 \); `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \); `numerator` is equal to the product of \( (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003 \); `denominator` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \); `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`; `p_total` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \); `p_shared` is equal to \( (p_total - p_no_shared + 1000003) \mod 1000003 \); `A` is equal to `p_shared` divided by `g`; `B` is equal to `p_total`.**
