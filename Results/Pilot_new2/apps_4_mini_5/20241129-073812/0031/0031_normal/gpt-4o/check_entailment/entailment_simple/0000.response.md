To verify the correctness of the given program against the provided problem description, we need to analyze whether the program accurately computes the probability of at least two of `k` people sharing a birthday among `2^n` possible days, and returns the result in the form of an irreducible fraction.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - `n` indicates the number of days as `2^n`.
   - `k` is the number of people.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The program first checks if `k` exceeds `2^n`. If it does, it correctly outputs `(1, 1)` because it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday (pigeonhole principle).
   - It computes the total number of days as `total_days = 1 << n` (which is equivalent to `2^n`).
   - It then calculates:
     - `numerator`: The product representing the number of ways to assign unique birthdays to `k` people.
     - `denominator`: The total number of possible birthday assignments, which is `(2^n)^k`.

3. **Final Probability**:
   - It calculates the number of favorable outcomes (at least two share a birthday) as `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.
   - The program then uses the `func_1` function to compute the GCD of the numerator and denominator.
   - It divides both the numerator and denominator by their GCD to ensure they are coprime.

4. **Output**:
   - The program finally prints the values of `A` and `B` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement:
- It handles boundary cases (when `k > 2^n`).
- It calculates the numerator and denominator accurately to derive the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday.
- It ensures the output is in the form of an irreducible fraction.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The program properly handles large values of `n` and `k` up to `10^18`.
- It ensures the computations remain within bounds by using modulo arithmetic consistently.

Since the program fulfills all the requirements laid out in the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
