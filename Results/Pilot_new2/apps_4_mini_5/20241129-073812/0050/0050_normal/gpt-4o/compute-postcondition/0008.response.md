The value of `max_shares` is assigned the result of integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. Given that `r` is an input value between 1 and 1000 and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, which is also an input value between 1 and 30, we can determine that `max_shares` will be an integer value based on these inputs. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input value between 1 and 30, `m` is the input value between 1 and 30, `r` is the input value between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 1000, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, and it is the case that `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`.**
