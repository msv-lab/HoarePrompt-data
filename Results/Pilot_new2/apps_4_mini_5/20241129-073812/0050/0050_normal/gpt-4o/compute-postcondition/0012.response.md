Postcondition: ***`n` is an input value between 1 and 30, `m` is an input value between 1 and 30, `r` is an input value between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 1000, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the value of `r` is printed. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, and the value of `total_bourles` is printed.***
