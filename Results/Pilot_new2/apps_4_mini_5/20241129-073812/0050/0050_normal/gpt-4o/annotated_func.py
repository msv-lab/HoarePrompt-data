#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), m is a positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), r is a positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), s is a list of n integers where each integer s_i is a price (1 <= s_i <= 1000), and b is a list of m integers where each integer b_i is a price (1 <= b_i <= 1000).
def func():
    n, m, r = map(int, input().split())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_buy_price = min(s)
    max_sell_price = max(b)
    if (max_sell_price <= min_buy_price) :
        print(r)
    else :
        max_shares = r // min_buy_price
        remaining_bourles = r % min_buy_price
        total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles
        print(total_bourles)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input value between 1 and 30, `m` is an input value between 1 and 30, `r` is an input value between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 1000, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the value of `r` is printed. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, and the value of `total_bourles` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, where `n` is the number of buying prices, `m` is the number of selling prices, and `r` is the amount of money available. It also takes two lists: `s` containing `n` buying prices and `b` containing `m` selling prices. It computes the minimum buying price and the maximum selling price. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buying price, computes the remaining money after buying shares, and then calculates the total amount of money if all shares were sold at the maximum selling price plus the remaining money. Finally, it prints the total amount of money. The function does not handle cases where `n`, `m`, or `r` are outside the specified bounds, nor does it validate the content of the lists `s` and `b` for the given constraints.
