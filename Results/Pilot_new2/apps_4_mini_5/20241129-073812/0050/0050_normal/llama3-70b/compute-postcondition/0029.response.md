The values of the variables do not change when the `break` statement is executed. The `break` statement causes an exit from the most internal loop or conditional structure that was being evaluated. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is the sum of all `r // s[i]` for each `i` such that `r >= s[i]`, `r` is the remainder after the last valid division, `n` is the original number of elements in `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, and `shares` is less than or equal to 0. The break occurs in the most internal loop or if statement.
