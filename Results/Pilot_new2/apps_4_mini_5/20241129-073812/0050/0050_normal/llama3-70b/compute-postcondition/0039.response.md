The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is the sum of all `r // s[i]` for each `i` such that `r >= s[i]`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
