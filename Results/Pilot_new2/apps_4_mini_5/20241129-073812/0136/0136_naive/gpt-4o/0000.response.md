Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where both input numbers are zero correctly. Specifically, if the input is:

```
0
0
```

The expected output should be `=` since the two numbers are equal. However, in this case, the program will strip the leading zeros from both inputs, resulting in both `a` and `b` being empty strings, which would then be set to `'0'`. The logic that checks for equality will then correctly recognize that both are equal, but the initial check for lengths followed by the comparison may cause confusion since leading zeros are stripped first.

Additionally, the program performs the comparison after length checks without considering the fact that it should also address cases where two very long integers that are equal after removing leading zeros should output `=`. 

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases according to the problem description and is incorrect as currently implemented.
