The program is designed to compare two non-negative integers represented as strings, accounting for leading zeros and very large sizes. The logic follows these steps:

1. It reads the input strings and removes leading zeros.
2. If either string becomes empty after removing leading zeros, it treats it as '0'.
3. It then compares the lengths of the two strings to determine which number is larger, printing the appropriate symbol.
4. If the lengths are equal, it compares the strings lexicographically and prints the relevant symbol.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems correct in handling most cases. However, there are specific edge cases to consider:

- The case where both input strings are empty (this technically should not happen based on the problem statement, but if it were to occur, the function would treat them as equal).
- The leading zero handling is correctly implemented by using `lstrip('0')`, and the function properly treats empty strings as '0'.
- The program does not handle inputs with excessive leading zeros differently than intended (for example, `000000` is treated as `0`, which is correct).

Now checking the output hints:
- The hints state that the function compares the non-negative integers, correctly prints '<', '>', or '=' based on those comparisons, and treats empty strings as '0'.
- The output hints also reflect the handling of leading zeros and the situation when both strings are empty.

After careful consideration:

- The program does correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement and matches the output hints.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code successfully compares large integers represented as strings, handles leading zeros, and addresses edge cases as outlined in the problem description. Thus, it meets the requirements for all specified cases.
