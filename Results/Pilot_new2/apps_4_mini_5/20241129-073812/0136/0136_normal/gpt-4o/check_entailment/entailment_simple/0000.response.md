Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the reasoning behind this conclusion:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input in a way that allows it to handle very large integers (up to 10^6 digits) by reading a whole line and splitting it into two strings, `a` and `b`. This adheres to the requirement of avoiding character-by-character reading.

2. **Leading Zeros**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both `a` and `b`. This ensures that the numerical comparison is conducted on the actual values represented by the strings, not their string representations with leading zeros.

3. **Zero Handling**: The program checks for empty strings after stripping leading zeros. If either `a` or `b` becomes an empty string (which would happen if the original number was "0" or had leading zeros only), it assigns '0' to that variable. This condition handles cases such as "00000" appropriately.

4. **Length Comparison**: The program first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. If `a` is shorter than `b`, it prints '<', and if `a` is longer, it prints '>'. This part of the logic correctly identifies which number is greater based on their length, as a longer string corresponds to a larger integer.

5. **Lexicographical Comparison**: If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, the program then compares the two strings directly. This is valid since both strings have been stripped of leading zeros, and comparing numeric strings of the same length can be done lexicographically.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparisons, which matches the output requirements provided in the problem statement.

Considering all these points, the program effectively meets the problem description's requirements for comparing two very large integers with potential leading zeros, ensuring correct behavior even under edge cases (like strings that represent zero).

Overall, the logic is sound, and the implementation follows the specified requirements correctly for all potential inputs.
