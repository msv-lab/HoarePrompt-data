The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings that represent non-negative integers. They may contain leading zeros and can have a length of up to 10^6 digits. The function performs operations on these string representations of integers. The specific output and behavior of the function are not provided in the details. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both are strings representing non-negative integers, potentially with leading zeros, and up to 10^6 digits in length.**
