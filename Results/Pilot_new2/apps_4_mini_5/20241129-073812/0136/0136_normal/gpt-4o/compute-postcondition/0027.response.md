Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings `a` and `b` that represent non-negative integers, possibly with leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. If either `a` or `b` is an empty string, they are treated as '0'. The function also handles cases where the lengths of the strings are different. If both strings are empty, they are both considered as '0', and '=' is printed. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result of the comparison. **
