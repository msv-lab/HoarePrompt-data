Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed, `b` is '0' if it was originally empty or retains its value if not empty, if the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, then '>' has been printed to the console. If the lengths are equal, if `a` is less than `b`, then the appropriate action for that condition has been taken; if `a` is greater than `b`, '>' has been printed to the console; if `a` is equal to `b`, then '=' has been printed to the console.***
