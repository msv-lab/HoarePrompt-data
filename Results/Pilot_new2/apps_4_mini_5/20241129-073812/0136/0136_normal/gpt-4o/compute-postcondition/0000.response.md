The `data` variable is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which takes an input string and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still strings representing non-negative integers. The input will determine the specific values of `data`, which will be a list of strings.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer, `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of strings created from input**.
