Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros, and `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output confirms their equality. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'.***
