The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, where `input()` accepts a user input string. The `lstrip('0')` method removes any leading zeros from that input string. The variable `a` remains unchanged, as it is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros; `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros; `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros.**
