Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly addresses the problem description by performing the following tasks:

1. It reads two very long integers (a and b) from input, which can contain leading zeros, and uses `sys.stdin.read` to handle large input efficiently.
2. It removes leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. 
3. If the resulting string is empty (meaning the original number was just zeros), it replaces it with '0'.
4. It compares the lengths of the two processed strings:
   - If the length of `a` is less than that of `b`, it prints '<'.
   - If the length of `a` is greater than that of `b`, it prints '>'.
5. If both lengths are equal, it performs a lexicographical comparison of `a` and `b` and prints the appropriate symbol.
6. It correctly handles edge cases, such as both numbers being zero or having leading zeros.

The logic covers all specified cases correctly, including handling of leading zeros and comparing very large integers represented as strings. Therefore, I cannot think of any potential case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description. 

Thus, the program operates correctly for all inputs specified in the problem statement.
