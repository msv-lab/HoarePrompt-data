The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers that satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not explicitly state its output in the provided information. Therefore, without further details on the function's output, we cannot define a specific return value. Based on the constraints given:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value is not specified in the provided information.**
