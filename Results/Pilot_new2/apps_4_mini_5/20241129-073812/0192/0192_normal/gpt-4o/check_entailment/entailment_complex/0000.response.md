To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic in the program in relation to the requirements specified.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Initial Triangle**: The program starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x`.
2. **Target Triangle**: The goal is to transform this triangle into an equilateral triangle of side length `y`.
3. **Constraints**: The triangle must remain a non-degenerate triangle throughout the transformation. Thus, at all times, all sides must be positive integers.
4. **Modification**: The program must determine the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this transformation.

### Analysis of the Program

The program has the following logic:
```python
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

This expression effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. Let's break down what this means:

- `(x - y) // 2` gives the integer division of the difference by 2.
- `(x - y) % 2` adds 1 if the difference is odd (since the ceiling of an odd number divided by 2 is one more than the floor).

### Reasoning About Correctness

To transform from an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to side length `y`, Memory can perform the following operations:

1. He can reduce the length of one side by 1 unit per second.
2. The goal is to reach a state where all three sides are equal to `y`.

To see if the program correctly calculates the minimum time:

- The difference between `x` and `y` is `diff = x - y`.
- To reach `y`, he needs to perform operations such that the total length of the sides reduces to `3y`.
- The total operations required to reduce the triangle from `(x, x, x)` to `(y, y, y)` must ensure that at any point, the sides remain positive and adhere to the triangle inequality.

In the worst-case scenario, if you modify one side at a time, you would need:
- `diff` units to reduce the overall length and ensure each side ends up at `y`. 

The program correctly computes:
- The number of seconds required based on how many total length units need to be modified, which translates mathematically to the ceiling of half the difference, effectively calculating how many operations are needed if you can change two sides simultaneously (the formula accounts for odd/even differences).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic needed to transform the triangle as described in the problem statement while adhering to all constraints and the desired output format.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **True**
