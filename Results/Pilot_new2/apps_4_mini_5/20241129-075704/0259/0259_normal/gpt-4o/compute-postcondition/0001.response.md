The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of -1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, and `min_wait_time`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1**
