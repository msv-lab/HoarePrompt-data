The code calculates the `wait_time` based on the values of `d_i`, `s_i`, and `t`. The previous states of the variables are:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`
- `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][1]`

Now, `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Therefore, the value of `wait_time` is calculated, but the exact numerical value cannot be determined without knowing `t`, `bus_routes[1][0]`, and `bus_routes[1][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`, `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][1]`, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
