The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The previous values of the variables indicate that `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`. Since the current value of `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time` before this assignment, we can conclude that `min_wait_time` will now equal `wait_time`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`, and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
