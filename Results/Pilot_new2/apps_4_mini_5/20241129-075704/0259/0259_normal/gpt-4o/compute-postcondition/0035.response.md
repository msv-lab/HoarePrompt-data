In the provided code snippet, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is 2, which means `chosen_route` will now be equal to 2 + 1, resulting in `chosen_route` being 3. The other variables remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment.

The updated values are:
- `chosen_route` is now 3.

The remaining variables' states remain as:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`
- `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`
- `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`; `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`; `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is 3**.
