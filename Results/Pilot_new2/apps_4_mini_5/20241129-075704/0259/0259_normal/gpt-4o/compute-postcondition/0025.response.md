The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is equal to 1, `chosen_route` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`, `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][1]`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`, `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][1]`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is equal to 2**.
