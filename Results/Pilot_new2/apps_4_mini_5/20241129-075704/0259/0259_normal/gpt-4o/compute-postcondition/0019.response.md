The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The previous value of `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`, and `t` is a predetermined variable, while the value of `wait_time` will now be calculated based on these values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`, `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][1]`, `wait_time` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0] - t`.**
