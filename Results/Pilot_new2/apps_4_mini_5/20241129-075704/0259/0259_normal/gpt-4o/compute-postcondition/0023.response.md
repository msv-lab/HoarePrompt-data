Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][0]`, and `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[1][1]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. Otherwise, if `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.***
