Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 1.***
