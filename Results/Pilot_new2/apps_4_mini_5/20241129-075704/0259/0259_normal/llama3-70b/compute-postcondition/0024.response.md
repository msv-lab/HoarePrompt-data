Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d). If `time` calculated as `(t - s) % d` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is equal to `time`, `ans` is set to 2, `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, and `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`. Otherwise, `min_time`, `ans`, `i`, `s`, and `d` remain unchanged.***
