The code appends a tuple (s, d) to the list `buses`. The variables `s` and `d` are accepted as input integers, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged, and we now include the new tuple in the `buses` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple (s, d), loop variable is 1, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.**
