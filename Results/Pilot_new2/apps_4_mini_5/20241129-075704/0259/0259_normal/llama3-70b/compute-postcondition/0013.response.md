`ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The other variables retain their initial conditions. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d), `min_time` is positive infinity, and `ans` is -1.
