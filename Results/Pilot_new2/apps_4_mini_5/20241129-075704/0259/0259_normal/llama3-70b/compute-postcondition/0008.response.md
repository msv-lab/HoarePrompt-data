According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as the loop variable (in this case, `_`) is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is within the range 2 to 100, and the loop variable is currently 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Thus, to continue executing, `_` must be less than `n`, making it necessary that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing the previous tuples plus the new tuple (s, d), loop variable is 2, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 2**
