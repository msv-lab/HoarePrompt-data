The variable `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`. Since `time` is currently less than `min_time`, the previous value of `min_time` (positive infinity) will change to the current value of `time`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is equal to `time`; `ans` is -1; `i` is 0; `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`; `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`; `time` is `(t - s) % d`.**
