The values of `n` and `t` are assigned from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which converts the split input values into integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, and `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000. After the execution of the code, `n` and `t` will hold the values provided through the input, but their specific values are not known.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is the input integer within the range 1 to 100000**
