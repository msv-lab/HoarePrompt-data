Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 10^9) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 8), provided via standard input. It increments `n` until it becomes a multiple of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Finally, it prints the modified value of `n`. The function does not handle cases where the original `n` is already a multiple of `10^k`, as it will still enter the loop and increment, which can lead to unexpected results if `k` is greater than 0. **
