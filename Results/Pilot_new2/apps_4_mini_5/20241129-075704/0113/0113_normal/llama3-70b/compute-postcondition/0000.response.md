In the provided code, `n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `input()` via the `map` function, which applies `int` conversion to the space-separated input values. The values of `n` and `k` will directly depend on user input.

The output state will reflect that `n` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^9\), and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8, but their specific values will now be the integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `n` and `k` are input integers.**
