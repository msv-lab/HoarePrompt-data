The value of `n` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value while maintaining the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 + 1, `n` must not be a multiple of 10, `n` must not be a multiple of `x`, and `n + 1` must not be a multiple of `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` + 1 ≤ 10^9 + 2, `n + 1` is not a multiple of `10`, `n + 1` is not a multiple of `x`, and `n` is adjusted to ensure that `n + 1` is not a multiple of `x`.**
