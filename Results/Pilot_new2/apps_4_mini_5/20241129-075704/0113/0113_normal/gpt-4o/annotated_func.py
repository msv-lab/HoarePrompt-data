#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is equal to n * (10 // math.gcd(n, 10)), where n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It calculates `x` as the product of `n` and (10 divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and 10). The function returns `x`. The value of `k` is not used in the computation, which could indicate a missing functionality related to the multiplier based on `k`.
