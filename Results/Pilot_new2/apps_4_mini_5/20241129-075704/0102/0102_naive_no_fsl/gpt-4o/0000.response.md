To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and consider the edge cases.

The code defines a function `func_1(n)` that converts an integer score (from 0 to 99) into its English word representation.

### Breakdown of the function:
1. **Arrays Defined**:
    - `ones`: Contains words for numbers 0-9.
    - `teens`: Contains words for numbers 11-19 (note that 'ten' is missing from this list).
    - `tens`: Contains words for multiples of ten (10, 20, 30, ..., 90).

2. **Conditional Logic**:
    - If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` array.
    - If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` array. This is correct for 11 to 19 but does not handle `10`, which should return "ten".
    - If `n` is between 10 and 99:
        - If `n` is a multiple of ten (i.e., `n % 10 == 0`), it returns the corresponding word from the `tens` array.
        - If `n` is not a multiple of ten, it combines the word from `tens` for the tens place and the word from `ones` for the units place with a hyphen in between.

### Missing Cases:
- The number `10` is not handled correctlyâ€”it falls into the range `10 <= n <= 19`, but it does not match any specific condition and will return `None`. This is a clear break from the requirements as `10` should return "ten".

### Additional Input Cases to Consider:
- The numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `9` will correctly return "zero", "one", ..., "nine".
- The numbers `11`, `12`, ..., `19` will correctly return "eleven", "twelve", ..., "nineteen".
- The numbers `20`, `21`, ..., `99` will correctly return "twenty", "twenty-one", ..., "ninety-nine".
- However, the case of `10` will not return anything valid.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to handle the case where `n` is `10`, it does not satisfy the problem description for all potential inputs. Therefore, the answer for correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
