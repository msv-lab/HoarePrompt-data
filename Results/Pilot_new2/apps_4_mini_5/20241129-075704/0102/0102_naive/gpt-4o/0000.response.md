To evaluate the provided program against the problem description:

1. The function `func_1(n)` handles numbers from 0 to 99.
2. It properly maps single-digit numbers (0-9) to their word equivalents using the `ones` list.
3. It correctly processes the numbers 11 to 19 using the `teens` list.
4. It checks if the number is a multiple of ten (10, 20, ... 90) using the `tens` list.
5. For numbers not in the above categories (e.g., 21, 22, ..., 29), it combines the words from `tens` and `ones` with a hyphen.

However, there is a missing handling for the number `10` in the `teens` list. The number `10` is supposed to return "ten", but the program incorrectly categorizes `10` under the `elif 10 <= n <= 99:` section. Since `10` is not included in the `teens` array (it is empty for that position), the function will return an empty string when the input is `10`.

In summary, hereâ€™s the specific case where the program fails:
- Input `10` should return "ten" but the program returns an empty string due to the lack of handling.

Thus, the output for this evaluation is:
Correctness: **False**.
