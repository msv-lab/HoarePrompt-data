The provided program is designed to convert an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its English word representation according to the problem description. Here’s the analysis of the program against the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts an integer input `n`, which is constrained to the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Output Specification**: The output must be a single string consisting only of English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'), with no spaces. The program correctly adheres to this requirement by using lists (`ones`, `teens`, `tens`) to construct the string representations without any spaces.

3. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - For `n` in the range 0 to 9, the program correctly returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
   - For `n` in the range 11 to 19, the program returns the appropriate word from the `teens` list. However, it correctly handles the fact that `teens[0]` is an empty string, which is consistent with the number "ten".
   - For values of `n` equal to 10 and multiples of 10 (20, 30, ..., 90), it correctly uses the `tens` list to retrieve the word representation.
   - For numbers that are not multiples of 10 (like 21, 22, ..., 29), it constructs the output as `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`, which properly formats the output with a hyphen.

4. **Special Cases**: 
   - The program handles the number 0 correctly by returning "zero".
   - The program includes the correct handling for the numbers around the range of interest, ensuring that all edge cases, like 10, 11, 20, and the highest number 99, are accounted for.

5. **Exclusion of Invalid Values**: The program is structured to only accept valid values within the specified range (0 to 99) given the condition checks, thus adhering strictly to the problem constraints.

Overall, the program correctly implements all specified functionalities and handles various input cases as described in the problem. 

Correctness: **True**
