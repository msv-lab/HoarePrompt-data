To evaluate the correctness of the annotated program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum possible distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) after performing exactly one swap in a given permutation of integers.

### Program Analysis:
1. The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct integers from 1 to n.
2. It calculates the positions of `1` (minimum) and `n` (maximum) in the list.
3. It then calculates the maximum distance that can be achieved by:
   - Computing the distance between the current positions of `1` and `n`.
   - Considering the distances to the ends of the list, specifically `0` and `n-1`.

### Code Breakdown:
- `pos1 = a.index(1)` retrieves the position of the minimum element (1).
- `posn = a.index(n)` retrieves the position of the maximum element (n).
- `max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`:
  - Here, `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` calculates the distance after one swap where they would be adjacent.
  - `n - 2` is hardcoded and seems to attempt to reflect the maximum distance between the two elements being at the ends of the list.
- `min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` tries to calculate a minimum distance based on the same logic.
- Finally, it prints `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`, likely intended to reflect the maximum achievable distance.

### Issues with the Program:
1. The line `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` to compute the distance does not correctly account for achieving the maximum distance. The maximum distance should be `n - 1` (which is the distance when one of them is at index 0 and the other at index n - 1).
2. The use of `min_dist` and its calculation seem unnecessary and incorrect. The program does not guarantee that it finds the optimal swap to maximize the distance.
3. The program does not account for the actual requirement of performing "exactly one swap" and what that entails for varying initial positions of `1` and `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic necessary to solve the problem as described. It includes incorrect calculations and assumptions about the distance rather than correctly determining the optimal swap.

Correctness: **False**
