To determine the output state after running the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the initial conditions and the effects of the print statement.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
   - `pos1` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`.
   - `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.
   - `max_dist` is calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
   - `min_dist` is calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code prints the value of `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `max_dist` and `min_dist` are derived from the variables `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`, we will express the output based on these calculations.
   - The expression `n - 1 - min_dist` involves the value of `min_dist`, which is already defined.

4. **Final Values:**
   - The output does not change the state of `n`, `a`, `pos1`, `posn`, `max_dist`, or `min_dist` but provides a computed result based on these values.

Thus, the output state will include `n`, `max_dist`, and `min_dist` along with the printed result.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is equal to `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); printed value is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**.
