The code `pos1 = a.index(1)` assigns the value of `pos1` to the index at which the integer `1` is found in the list `a`. Given that `a` consists of `n` distinct integers, we can assume that `1` is indeed one of those integers within the range provided. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`.**
