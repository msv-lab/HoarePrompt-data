The value of `n` is being reassigned to `int(input())`, which means that `n` is now set to an integer value based on user input. However, since there is no specific input provided, we can only state that `n` is now an integer that meets the condition of `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`. The list `a` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive)**.
