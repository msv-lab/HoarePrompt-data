The code snippet provided is intended to print the value of `max_divisor`. Based on the initial state, we know that `max_divisor` is equal to the largest divisor of `gcd`, which is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, `max_divisor` is equal to the largest divisor of `gcd`, `i` is equal to `int(sqrt(gcd))`, and `max_divisor` is printed.**
