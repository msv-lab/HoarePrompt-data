Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, `i` is 1, and if `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of `max_divisor` and `gcd`, provided that `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.***
