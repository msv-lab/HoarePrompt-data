The variable `gcd` is updated by applying the `math.gcd` function to its current value and the value of `A[i]`, where `i` is currently 3. The existing value of `gcd` is based on the previous calculation of `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])`. Therefore, `gcd` will now hold the greatest common divisor of the previous `gcd` and `A[3]`. The states of the other variables `N`, `K`, `A`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` is updated to `math.gcd(gcd, A[3])`, `i` is 3**
