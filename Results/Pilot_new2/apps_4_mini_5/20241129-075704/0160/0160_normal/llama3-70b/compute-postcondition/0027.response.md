Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` is at least 9, and `i` is 3. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of `max_divisor` and 3, and if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, the program continues processing according to the subsequent logic. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, the program does not execute any else part.***
