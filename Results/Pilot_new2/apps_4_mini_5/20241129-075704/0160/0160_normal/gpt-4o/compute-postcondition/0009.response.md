Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where the first element `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element `K` is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of `N` integers `A` (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N). If `x` is divisible by `i` (where `i` is 2), the `divisors` set is updated to include the values `1`, `2`, `N`, and `N // 2`.***
