The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a tuple. The first element of the tuple is a positive integer `N` (where 2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer `K` (where 0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` integers `A`, each between 1 and 10^6 (where 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N). After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list of all divisors of `N` in descending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a tuple `x` consisting of a positive integer `N`, a non-negative integer `K`, and a list `A`, and return a sorted list of all divisors of `N` in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple x containing a positive integer N, a non-negative integer K, and a list A of N integers, and returns a sorted list of all divisors of N in descending order.**
