To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to assess the impact of the statement `divisors.add(x // i)` and how it modifies the state of the program given the initial conditions.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is a tuple where:
     - The first element `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500).
     - The second element `K` is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9).
     - The third element is a list `A` consisting of `N` integers (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N).
   - `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(N)) + 1`, which means it will be a value greater than or equal to 2.
   - `divisors` is a set that currently holds certain values.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `divisors.add(x // i)` is executed, where `x` refers to the first element of the tuple, which is `N`.
   - The operation `N // i` computes the integer division of `N` by `i` and adds this result to the `divisors` set.

3. **Calculating the Value**:
   - Since `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(N)) + 1`, it will be greater than or equal to 2.
   - Thus, `N // i` will result in an integer value that is at most `N // 2` (if `i` equals 2) and at least `0` (if `N` is small relative to `i`).

4. **Output State**:
   - The output state needs to reflect the unchanged elements of `x`, the computed value added to `divisors`, and the updated state of the `divisors` set.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element `K` is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of `N` integers (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N); `i` is `int(math.sqrt(N)) + 1`; `divisors` now includes the value `N // i`.**
