Initially, we have:
- `x` is a tuple where:
  - The first element `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500).
  - The second element `K` is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9).
  - The third element is a list `A` containing `N` integers, each within the range (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N).
- `divisors` is a set containing the values `1`, `2`, and `N`.
- `i` is 2.

The line of code `divisors.add(x // i)` attempts to add the value of `x // i` to the `divisors` set. However, `x` is a tuple, and we need to extract its first element `N` to perform the integer division.

Calculating `x // i`:
- `x[0]` is `N`, so `x // i` would be `N // 2`.

Now, we can add `N // 2` to the `divisors` set. Since `N` is within the range 2 to 500, `N // 2` will yield a non-negative integer.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so we will include them in the output state.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element `K` is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of `N` integers `A` (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N); `divisors` is a set containing the values `1`, `2`, `N`, and `N // 2`; `i` is 2.**
