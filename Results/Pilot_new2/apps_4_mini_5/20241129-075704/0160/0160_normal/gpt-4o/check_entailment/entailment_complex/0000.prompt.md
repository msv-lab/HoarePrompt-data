You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N.
You can perform the following operation between 0 and K times (inclusive):
 - Choose two integers i and j such that i \neq j, each between 1 and N (inclusive). Add 1 to A_i and -1 to A_j, possibly producing a negative element.
Compute the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. Here a positive integer x divides an integer y if and only if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 500
 - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^6
 - 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_{N-1} A_{N}

-----Output-----
Print the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

-----Sample Input-----
2 3
8 20

-----Sample Output-----
7

7 will divide every element of A if, for example, we perform the following operation:
 - Choose i = 2, j = 1. A becomes (7, 21).
We cannot reach the situation where 8 or greater integer divides every element of A.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where the first two integers represent N (the number of elements) and K (the maximum number of operations), followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N satisfying 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `gcd_result` is the GCD of all integers in `lst`, where `gcd_result` is equal to gcd(lst[0], lst[1], ..., lst[len(lst) - 1]).
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns gcd_result which is the GCD of all integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers where the first integer represents N, the second integer represents K, and the subsequent integers are the elements from which to compute the GCD. It returns the GCD of all the integers in the list. The function assumes that there are at least two integers in the list and does not handle cases where the list has fewer integers or if any integers are zero, which could cause the GCD calculation to be undefined in certain contexts.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N integers A, each between 1 and 10^6 (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N).
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a tuple where the first element `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element `K` is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of `N` integers `A` (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N). `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `N`, including `1`, `N`, and any other divisors found through the loop iterations.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of all divisors of N in descending order, where N is a positive integer between 2 and 500.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple containing a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and a list A of N integers (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6). It calculates and returns a sorted list of all divisors of N in descending order. The function does not utilize the values of K or A in its computations, which may indicate missing functionality.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
