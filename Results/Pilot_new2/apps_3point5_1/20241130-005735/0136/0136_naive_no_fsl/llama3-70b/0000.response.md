Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program reads two very long integers a and b, removes leading zeroes from them, and then compares the two numbers to determine if a is less than, equal to, or greater than b. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the cases where a < b, a = b, and a > b. The logic of comparing the two numbers after removing leading zeroes is correct and the program produces the expected output for all provided examples. Additionally, the program works as expected for other potential cases as well. Hence, the program is correct.
