Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads two integers a and b as strings and removes leading zeros from them. It then compares the lengths of a and b. If the lengths are not equal, it directly prints the result based on the lengths. If the lengths are equal, it compares the actual values of a and b and prints the result accordingly. The program correctly handles the cases where a < b, a > b, and a = b as per the problem description.
