You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".


-----Examples-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are no specific preconditions for this problem.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`data` is a list containing the values entered as input and separated by spaces. `a` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. `b` is the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed. After entering the if condition, `a` evaluates to False.
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`data` is a list containing the values entered as input and separated by spaces. `a` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. `b` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. After entering the if condition, `a` evaluates to False. The current value of `b` results in a False evaluation when used in the `not` operation.
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`data` is a list containing the input values. `a` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. `b` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. The length of `a` is not less than the length of `b`. The current value of `b` does not result in a True evaluation when used in the `not` operation. The condition (len(a) > len(b)) is false after not entering the if block, `a` is not less than `b`, and after the if block, the value of `a` is greater than `b`. However, if `a` is not greater than `b`, `a` is not less than `b`, and (a <= b).
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`data` is a list containing the input values. `a` and `b` are strings with leading zeros removed. The length of `a` is not less than the length of `b`. The current value of `b` does not result in a True evaluation when used in the `not` operation. The condition (len(a) > len(b)) is false after not entering the if block. If `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` and is also not greater than `b`, then `a` is not less than `b`. If `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is greater than `b` after the execution of the if else block.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`data` is a list containing the input values. `a` and `b` are strings with leading zeros removed. The length of `a` is not less than the length of `b`. The current value of `b` does not result in a True evaluation when used in the `not` operation. After the execution of the if else block, if `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` and is also not greater than `b`, then `a` is not less than `b`. If `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is greater than `b`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`data` is a list containing the input values. `a` and `b` are strings with leading zeros removed. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is not less than the length of `b`, and `a` is not less than `b`, the program will not print anything. If `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is greater than `b`, the program will not print anything.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
