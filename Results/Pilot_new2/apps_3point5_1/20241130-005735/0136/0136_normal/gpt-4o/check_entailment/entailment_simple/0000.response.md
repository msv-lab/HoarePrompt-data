Correctness: **True**

The program reads two integers a and b as strings, removes any leading zeros, and compares them based on their lengths and values. It correctly outputs '<' if a is less than b, '>' if a is greater than b, and '=' if they are equal, as specified in the problem description. The program handles the case of leading zeros in the input by removing them before comparison. The comparisons are done based on the length of the strings and the actual values of the numbers, ensuring that the correct output is printed. Overall, the program follows the requirements of the problem description and provides the expected output for all cases.
