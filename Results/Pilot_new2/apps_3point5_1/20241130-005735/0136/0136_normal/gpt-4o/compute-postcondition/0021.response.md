Output State: **`data` is a list containing the values entered as input and separated by spaces. `a` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. `b` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. The length of `a` is not less than the length of `b`. The current value of `b` does not result in a True evaluation when used in the `not` operation. The condition (len(a) > len(b)) is false after not entering the if block, `a` is not less than `b`, and (a <= b).**
