Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip` method. The previous value of `data` is a list containing the values entered as input and separated by spaces. If `data[0]` had leading zeros, they have been removed and `a` now holds the modified value. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the values entered as input and separated by spaces, `a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed.**
