Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing the input values. `a` and `b` are strings with leading zeros removed. The length of `a` is not less than the length of `b`. The current value of `b` does not result in a True evaluation when used in the `not` operation. The condition (len(a) > len(b)) is false after not entering the if block. If `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` and is also not greater than `b`, then `a` is not less than `b`. If `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is greater than `b` after the execution of the if else block.***
