Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing the input values. `a` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. `b` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. The length of `a` is not less than the length of `b`. The current value of `b` does not result in a True evaluation when used in the `not` operation. The condition (len(a) > len(b)) is false after not entering the if block, `a` is not less than `b`, and after the if block, the value of `a` is greater than `b`. However, if `a` is not greater than `b`, `a` is not less than `b`, and (a <= b).***
