Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads two non-negative integers with no leading zeroes as input. It then compares the two numbers and prints "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b, as required by the problem description. The program handles cases where the numbers have leading zeroes by removing them using the `lstrip()` function before comparison. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the correct output.
