Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` with no leading zeroes, compares their values, and prints the corresponding symbol ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison result. The program handles cases where `a` is less than `b`, `a` is greater than `b`, and `a` is equal to `b` as specified in the problem description.

The use of `lstrip('0')` ensures that any leading zeroes are removed from the input integers `a` and `b`, and the comparison is done correctly. The program follows the requirements of the problem description and provides the correct output for the given inputs.
