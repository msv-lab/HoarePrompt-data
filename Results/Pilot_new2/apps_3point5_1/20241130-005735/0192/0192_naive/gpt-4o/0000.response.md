Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the side lengths of the starting and ending equilateral triangles respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle with side length x into the triangle with side length y, following the rules provided.

The program uses the formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2) to calculate the minimum number of seconds needed. This formula is correct as it correctly handles all possible cases and follows the rules outlined in the problem description.

For every input case provided in the examples, the program produces the correct output. Additionally, the program logic aligns with the problem description by ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate (triangle of positive area) at every step. Hence, the program is correct for all potential cases.
