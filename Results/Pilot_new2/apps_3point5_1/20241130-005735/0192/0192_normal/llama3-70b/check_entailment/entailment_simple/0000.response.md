Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem description. It takes two integers x and y as input, representing the side lengths of the starting and ending equilateral triangles respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which represents the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the starting equilateral triangle of side length x.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to transform the equilateral triangle from side length x to side length y.
