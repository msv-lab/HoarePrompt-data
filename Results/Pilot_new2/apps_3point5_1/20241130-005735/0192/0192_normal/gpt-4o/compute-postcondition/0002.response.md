The function `func` accepts no parameters. The function is designed to generate and return a list of all prime numbers between x and y (inclusive), where x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to return a list of prime numbers within the specified range based on the constraints given. 
Functionality: **The function generates and returns a list of prime numbers between x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
