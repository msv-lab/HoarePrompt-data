Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately follows the problem description. It considers all possible ways to buy shares in the morning based on the available bourles and the prices, then sells the shares in the evening to maximize the final amount of bourles. The logic implemented in the code ensures that shares are bought according to the available funds and only sold if profitable. The code handles the scenarios of buying shares in the morning and selling them in the evening correctly, resulting in the maximum profit. Additionally, the output hints agree with the implemented logic and describe the functionality accurately without suggesting any edge cases that are not covered by the code. Hence, the code can be considered correct.
