Postcondition: ***`shares`, `r` are integers. If shares > 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `b` remain the same as their original values, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. If shares is not greater than 0, `r` remains the remaining amount of money, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `b` remain the same as their original values, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. The number of shares bought is not greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
