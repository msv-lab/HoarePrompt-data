Postcondition: ***n, m, r are positive integers between 1 and 30, s_i, b_i are positive integers between 1 and 1000, s is a list of integers in ascending order, b is a list of integers in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1. If r >= s[i], `shares` is increased by the integer division of r by s[i] and r is updated to the modulus of the previous value of r divided by s[i]. If r < s[i], we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
