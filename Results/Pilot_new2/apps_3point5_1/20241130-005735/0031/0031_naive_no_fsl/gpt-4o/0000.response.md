Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a given scenario.
2. It handles the case where k is greater than 2^n by printing 1 and 1, as it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday.
3. The program calculates the numerator and denominator using the given formula and applies modulo operation appropriately.
4. The program then calculates the probability of no one sharing the same birthday and subtracts it from the total, as described in the problem statement.
5. Finally, it reduces the fraction to its irreducible form and prints the result modulo 10^6 + 3.
