Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in the calculation of the probability. The for loop in the function `func_1` is not correctly calculating the probability of at least two people having the same birthday. The calculation of the numerator and denominator within the loop is incorrect.

An example where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
3 2

Expected Output:
1 8

Actual Output:
1 6

This discrepancy shows that the program is not correctly calculating the probability as described in the problem statement.
