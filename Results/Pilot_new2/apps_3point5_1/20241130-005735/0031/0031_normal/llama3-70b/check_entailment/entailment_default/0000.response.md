Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the given problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. However, the implementation of the `func_1` function is incorrect.

The issue lies in the calculation of the numerator and denominator in the function `func_1`. The numerator is calculated as the product of consecutive decreasing values from total_days to total_days - k, while the denominator is simply the product of consecutive values from total_days to 1.

This approach does not correctly calculate the probability as described in the problem. The correct calculation should involve considering the complement of the event "no two people have the same birthday" and subtracting it from 1. The numerator and denominator should represent the total number of ways to select k distinct birthdays and the total number of possible outcomes, respectively.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is therefore incorrect.
