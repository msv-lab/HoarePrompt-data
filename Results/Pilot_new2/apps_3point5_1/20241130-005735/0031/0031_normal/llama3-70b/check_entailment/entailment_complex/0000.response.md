Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It calculates the probability as an irreducible fraction and returns the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 for both the numerator and denominator.

The program uses a loop to calculate the numerator and denominator based on the input values of n and k, then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) to simplify the fraction. Finally, it returns the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 as required.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
