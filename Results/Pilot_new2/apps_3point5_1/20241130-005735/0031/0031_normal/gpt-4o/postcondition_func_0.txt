The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of their original values, and returns the GCD. The function implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD. In case where `b` is initially 0, it returns the original value of `a` as the GCD. The function handles edge cases where `a` and `b` are within specified ranges.
