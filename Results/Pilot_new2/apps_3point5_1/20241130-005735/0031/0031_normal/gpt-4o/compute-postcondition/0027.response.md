The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. The constraints for `n` are 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and for `k` are 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The program does not return any specific value, as no calculations or operations are performed. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k` within the specified constraints.
