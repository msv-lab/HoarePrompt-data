Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately follows the problem description by taking two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculating the minimum sum based on the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and checking if the minimum sum is greater than `n`.
- It correctly handles the case where the minimum sum is greater than `n` by returning -1.
- The function then proceeds to calculate `d`, `remainder`, and generates a list `sequence` based on the provided formula.
- The code correctly adjusts the values in the sequence to incorporate any remainder and ensure that the sum is equal to `n`.
- The function returns the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise, it returns -1.
- The code also handles the scenario where there are multiple possible sequences by providing any of them as output.
- Given the code logic and the provided examples, it can be concluded that the code meets the problem description requirements for all potential cases.
