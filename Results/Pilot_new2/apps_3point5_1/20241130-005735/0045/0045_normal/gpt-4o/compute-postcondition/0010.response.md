Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to k*(k + 1) // 2 and the calculated `min_sum` is less than or equal to n, d is equal to n divided by `min_sum`, remainder = n - d * `min_sum`, sequence is a list containing values calculated as d * (i + 1) for i in range(k), `i` starts at k - 1 and decrements down to 0. Additionally, if the current value of remainder is 0, then the program completes successfully without executing the else part and the overall state remains the same as described above.***
