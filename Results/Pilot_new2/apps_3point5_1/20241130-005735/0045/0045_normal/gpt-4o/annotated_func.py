        #The program returns -1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, min_sum is equal to k*(k + 1) // 2. The calculated min_sum is less than or equal to n

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to k*(k + 1) // 2, calculated `min_sum` is less than or equal to n, `d` is equal to n divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to n - `d` * `min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing values calculated as `d` * (i + 1) for i in range(k), `i` is -1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, then the program breaks out of the loop.
    return sequence
    #The program returns the list 'sequence' which contains values calculated as 'd' * (i + 1) for i in range(k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. It first calculates `min_sum` based on the formula k * (k + 1) // 2 and checks if `min_sum` is greater than `n`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate `d`, `remainder`, and generates a list `sequence` based on the given formula. The function then returns the list `sequence`. If the calculated `remainder` becomes 0 during the loop execution, the loop breaks. Therefore, the function either returns -1 or a list `sequence` with values calculated as `d` * (i + 1) for i in range(k).
