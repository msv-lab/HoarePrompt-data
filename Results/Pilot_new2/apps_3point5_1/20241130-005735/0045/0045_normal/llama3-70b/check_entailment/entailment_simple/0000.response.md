Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a correct implementation as determining the greatest common divisor is a crucial step in finding the sequence of numbers that meet the conditions specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the requirements of the problem description and the function will correctly calculate the greatest common divisor for the given input.
