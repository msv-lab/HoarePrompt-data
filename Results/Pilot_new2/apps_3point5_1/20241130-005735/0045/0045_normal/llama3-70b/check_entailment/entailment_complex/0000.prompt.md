You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers.**
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `b` must be true or non-zero for the loop to execute, `a` is equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is equal to the modulo of `n` and `k`
    return a
    #The program returns the previous value of `b`, which is equal to the modulo of `n` and `k`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, and calculates the greatest common divisor of `n` and `k` using the Euclidean algorithm. It then returns the calculated greatest common divisor.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
