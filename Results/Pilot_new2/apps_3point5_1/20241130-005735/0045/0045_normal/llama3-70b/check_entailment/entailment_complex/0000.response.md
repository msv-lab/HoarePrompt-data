Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function can be used to determine the greatest common divisor between `n` and `k`, which is relevant to the problem description. The program does not directly solve the problem, but it provides a key function that can be used in solving the problem correctly.
