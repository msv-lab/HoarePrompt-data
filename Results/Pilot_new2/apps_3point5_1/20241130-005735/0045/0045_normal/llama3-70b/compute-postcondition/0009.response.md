Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, and calculates the greatest common divisor of `n` and `k` using the Euclidean algorithm. It then returns the calculated greatest common divisor. **

The code correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of the two input integers `n` and `k`, which is stored in the variable `a`. The function operates under the assumption that `n` and `k` are positive integers. It successfully returns the greatest common divisor, which is the final value of `a` after the algorithm terminates. The function does not handle edge cases such as division by zero or negative integers, assuming the inputs are valid positive integers.
