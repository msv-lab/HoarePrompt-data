Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes in two integers n and k, then it generates a sequence of k positive numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal. The program iterates from 1 to k, adding the numbers to the sequence as long as n is greater than or equal to the current number. If the sequence is not of length k at the end, it outputs -1, otherwise, it outputs the sequence.

The program logic aligns with the problem description provided. It handles cases where n is less than k, outputs -1 in such cases. It generates a sequence of k positive numbers that sum up to n and ensures that the greatest common divisor is maximized. The implementation covers all potential cases and outputs the correct result as per the problem description.
