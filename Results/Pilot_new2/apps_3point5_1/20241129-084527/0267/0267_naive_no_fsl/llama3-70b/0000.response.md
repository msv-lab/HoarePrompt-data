Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The implementation of the `count` function correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits. The main function then uses this count to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` and returns the result modulo `998244353`. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases.
