Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits.
2. The `func_1` function checks if a number has at most $k$ different digits by converting the number to a string, converting it to a set to get unique digits, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to $k$.
3. The `func_2` function iterates through the range of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (inclusive) and adds the number to the total sum only if it satisfies the condition of having at most $k$ different digits.
4. The program calculates the total sum modulo $998244353$ as required.
5. The program takes input correctly, calls the `func_2` function, and prints the output, all according to the problem description.
