Output State: n is at least 10, k is greater than 1, dp does not contain the pair (n, k), dp[n, k] = 9, i is 1. After running the code, dp[n, k] is updated by adding 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)) to its previous value.
(dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)) )
