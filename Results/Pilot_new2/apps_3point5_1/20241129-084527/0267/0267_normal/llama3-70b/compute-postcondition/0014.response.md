According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state is:
Output State: dp[n, k] is updated to dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
n is at least 10, k is greater than 1, dp does not contain the pair (n, k), dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * 10, `i` is undefined.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be increased by 1. So, the new state should be updated accordingly:
State: **Output State: dp[n, k] is updated to dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 ** (i) * (10 ** (k - i - 1) - 10 ** (i)) where i is now defined, `i` is 1**.
