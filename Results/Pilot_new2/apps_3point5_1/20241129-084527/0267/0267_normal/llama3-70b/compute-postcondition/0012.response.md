According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
Output State: n is at least 10, k is greater than 1, dp does not contain the pair (n, k), dp[n, k] = 9, i is 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `i` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so `i` should be 2.
- Since the loop is running until `i` reaches `k`, `k` should remain the same as it is greater than 1.
- Since the loop is running until `i` reaches `k`, the condition `i < k` should still hold true for the next iteration.
- The calculation for updating `dp[n, k]` should be performed with the new value of `i`.

State: **Output State: n is at least 10, k is greater than 1, dp does not contain the pair (n, k), dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * 10 ** (1 - 1) * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10 ** (1 - 1)), i is 2**
