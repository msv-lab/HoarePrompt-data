Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `dp` are integers, such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10. `dp` is a dictionary containing precomputed values for dynamic programming. `k` is not equal to 0. If ((n, k) is in dp), then the current values of n and k are in dp with their corresponding precomputed values.***
