Postcondition: ***n, k, and dp are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary containing precomputed values for dynamic programming. k is not equal to 0. The pair (n, k) is not present in dp. If n < 10^k, then dp[n, k] = n. Otherwise, after the execution, dp[n, k] will be updated to dp[n, k] + 9 * (10 + (10; dp[n, k]) modulo MOD.***
