The function `func_1` accepts three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, where l and r satisfy 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k satisfies 1 <= k <= 10. The function calculates the difference between the count of k from r and the count of k from l-1 modulo MOD, using an empty dictionary dp. It returns this calculated result.
