Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of numbers between l and r that have at most k different digits. The program computes the count of such numbers efficiently and returns the result modulo 998244353, as required by the problem statement.

The count function computes the number of valid numbers less than or equal to n that have at most k different digits, storing precomputed values in a dictionary dp. The func_1 function then calculates the final result by finding the count of numbers less than or equal to r and subtracting the count of numbers less than or equal to l-1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the specified logic and constraints of the problem description, making it a valid solution.
