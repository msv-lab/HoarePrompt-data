Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided Python program and the annotations, it can be observed that the program closely follows the problem description for every potential case. The functions `func_1` and `count` are correctly implemented to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits modulo $998244353$. The logic in the functions aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description, and the annotations provide additional clarity on the state of the program before and after function calls.

Furthermore, the code annotations and descriptions of the functions seem to accurately describe the functionality of the program and match the problem requirements. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are consistent with how the program is expected to behave.

Therefore, based on the alignment of the code with the problem description, the correct implementation of the functions, and the agreement between the annotations and the actual code, the correctness of the program is assessed as **True**.
