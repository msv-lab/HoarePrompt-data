Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count`.
- The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It calls the `count` function to count the numbers satisfying the conditions for each given number in the range.
- The `count` function handles different cases based on the values of `n` and `k` to accurately count the numbers meeting the requirements.
- The implementation seems to correctly capture the essence of the problem description by calculating the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits within the given range.
- Since the code logically follows the problem description and the implementation of the functions aligns with the requirements specified, we can conclude that the code is correct.
