The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, if the number of unique digits in the integer 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return True if the number of unique digits in 'n' is less than or equal to 'k'. If the number of unique digits in 'n' exceeds 'k', it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, n and k, and returns True if the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k. Otherwise, it returns False.**
