#State of the program right berfore the function call: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the number of unique digits in the integer 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where n has a constraint of 1 <= n <= 10^18 and k has a constraint of 1 <= k <= 10. It returns True if the number of unique digits in the integer 'n' is less than or equal to 'k', otherwise it returns False. The function operates as described in the annotations, comparing the number of unique digits in n to k to determine the return value.
