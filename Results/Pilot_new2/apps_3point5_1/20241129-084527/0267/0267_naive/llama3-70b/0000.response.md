Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. 

The `count` function within `func_1` is responsible for counting the numbers with at most `k` different digits within a given range. It correctly handles the cases when `k = 0` and `n < 10**k`. 

The main logic of the program correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits for both `r` and `l-1` and then subtracts the counts to get the sum of numbers in the given range. 

The program uses dynamic programming to optimize the computation by storing the results in a dictionary `dp`. 

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible cases within the given constraints.
