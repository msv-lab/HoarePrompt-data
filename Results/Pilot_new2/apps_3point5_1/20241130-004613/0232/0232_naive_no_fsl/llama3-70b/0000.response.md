Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic used to check if there is an interval with the prescribed color counts. The program uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible contiguous intervals, which is not efficient and does not guarantee the correct solution.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use a sliding window technique. By maintaining a window with the desired color counts and moving it forward while adjusting the counts, we can determine if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts.

Therefore, the program needs to be modified to implement the sliding window technique in order to accurately check if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists.
