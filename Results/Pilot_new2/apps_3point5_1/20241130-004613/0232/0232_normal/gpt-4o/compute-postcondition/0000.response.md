Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. k is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n. desired_counts is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count based on the values in list k.**
