According to the code, the loop can execute as long as all colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`. Right before the loop, it is already ensured that all colors meet the desired counts, so no adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **Output State: All colors in `current_counts` are equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`, program returns 'YES', `left` is increased by the total number of times the loop executed, `right` is incremented by 1, and the count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` is increased by 1**
