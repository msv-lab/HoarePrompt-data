Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the list of colors, keeping track of the counts of each color and checking if the current interval of Jedi Knights matches the desired counts. If it finds an interval that matches, it returns 'YES'. If it goes through all possible intervals and doesn't find a match, it returns 'NO'.

The program ensures that the contiguous interval selected contains exactly the desired counts of each color, as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
