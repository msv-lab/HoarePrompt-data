Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It first reads the input values, then iterates over all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights to check if the counts of lightsabers of each color match the desired counts. If a matching interval is found, it sets the `found` flag to True and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints "YES" if `found` is True, indicating that an interval with the prescribed color counts exists, and "NO" otherwise.

The program ensures that it considers all possible contiguous intervals within the list of Jedi Knights and correctly checks if the counts of each color in those intervals match the desired counts. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and outputs the correct result for all potential cases.
