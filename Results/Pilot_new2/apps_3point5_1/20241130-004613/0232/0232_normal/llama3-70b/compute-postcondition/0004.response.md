According to the code, the loop can execute if the list of colors contains at least 1 element. For the loop to execute, the list of colors must have at least one color, and the color is the first element in the list. 
State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, colors is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and must have at least 1 color, color is the first color in the list, counts is the list of integers obtained by splitting the input, color_counts is an empty dictionary**.
