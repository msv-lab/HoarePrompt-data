Postcondition: ***All variables (`n`, `m`, `colors`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `j`, `window_counts`) are still incremented by 1. `window_counts` remains a dictionary with key `color` and value `1`. `found` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
