Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, colors is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and must have at least 3 colors, color is the third color in the list, counts is the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. If color is not in color_counts, then color_counts[color] is set to 0. color_counts[color] has been incremented by 1.**
