Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers with at least n colors, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` is the list of integers, `color_counts` has updated values with the number of occurrences of color, `found` is True, `window_counts` has the count of colors until index `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` will be 0 after the if-else block executes.***
