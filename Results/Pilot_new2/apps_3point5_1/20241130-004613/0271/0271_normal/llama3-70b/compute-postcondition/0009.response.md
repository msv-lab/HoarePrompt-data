Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer. If n is divisible by 10 with a remainder of 0, the value of n is printed. If n is not divisible by 10, the value printed is based on the value of n % 10. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the printed value is n - n % 10. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the printed value is 10.***
