Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes an integer input `n`, checks if `n` is divisible by 10. If it is divisible by 10, it prints `n` as it is already rounded. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it then checks if `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5. If it is, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 below `n`. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 above `n`, ensuring that the result ends in 0, as required by the problem description.

The program covers all possible cases and correctly determines the rounded value of `n` based on the specified conditions. Therefore, the correctness is true.
