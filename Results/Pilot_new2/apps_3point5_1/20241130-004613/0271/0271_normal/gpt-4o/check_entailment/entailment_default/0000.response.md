Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided takes an integer input `n` and rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with zero. The logic behind the code is to calculate the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. Based on this remainder, the code correctly determines the rounded number by either subtracting the remainder from `n` if it is less than or equal to 5, or by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n` if it is greater than 5. This logic aligns with the problem description, which states that Vasya should round the number to the nearest integer that ends with zero.
The code also handles the case when `n` already ends with zero by returning the same value. Overall, the code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and gives the correct output for each scenario.
