Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the substring contains leading zeroes. In such cases, the program may not output the smallest possible integer n. For example, if the input is:
```
100011
100
```
The expected output should be `1001`, but the program may output a larger number due to the leading zeroes in the substring.
