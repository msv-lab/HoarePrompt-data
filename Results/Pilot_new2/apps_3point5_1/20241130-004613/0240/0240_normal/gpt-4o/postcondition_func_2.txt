The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes in two parameters, `chars` and `sub`, where `chars` is a string representing a very large integer, and `sub` is a substring of `chars`. The function iterates over all possible permutations of `chars` and yields candidates that are valid numbers based on the `is_valid_number` function. The function does not return any specific output but yields valid candidate numbers.
