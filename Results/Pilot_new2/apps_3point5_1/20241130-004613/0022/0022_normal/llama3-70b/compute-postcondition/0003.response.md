According to the code, the loop will execute for half the length of string `s`. Since `n` is the length of string `s`, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 0.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s` which must be greater than or equal to 2; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
