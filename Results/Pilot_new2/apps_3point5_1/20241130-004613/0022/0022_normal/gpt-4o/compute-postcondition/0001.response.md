According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of string `s` is at least 2. Since `n` is the length of string `s`, the string must have a length of at least 2 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `(n // 2) - 1` during the loop iterations.

State: **s is a string containing only English letters with a length of at least 2, n is the length of string s, i is 0 and goes up to (n // 2) - 1**
