Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a string is "s-palindrome". It iterates through the string from both ends towards the middle and checks if the characters at symmetric positions are equal. If at any point the characters do not match, it returns False indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome". If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it returns True indicating that the string is an "s-palindrome". The program covers all potential cases and works correctly for all possible inputs within the constraints specified.
