The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input and calculates certain relationships between these integers. It then prints a specific symbol ('+', '-', or '?') based on the comparisons of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The program checks if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` and prints '-' if true. It then checks if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` and prints '+' if true. If both conditions are false, it prints '?'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
