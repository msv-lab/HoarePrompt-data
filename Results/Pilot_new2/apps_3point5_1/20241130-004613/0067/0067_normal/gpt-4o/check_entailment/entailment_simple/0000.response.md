Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the input values of x, y, and z. Then, it checks the conditions to determine the result (+, -, or ?) as per the given rules in the problem description.

The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and outputs the correct result in each case. It correctly handles the uncertainty when there are multiple possible results due to the unknown votes of z persons.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
