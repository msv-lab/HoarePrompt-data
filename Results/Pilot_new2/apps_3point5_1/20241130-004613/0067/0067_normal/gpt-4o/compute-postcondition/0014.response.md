The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it performs some operations or calculations based on these parameters. The output or side effects of the function depend on the specific implementation.
