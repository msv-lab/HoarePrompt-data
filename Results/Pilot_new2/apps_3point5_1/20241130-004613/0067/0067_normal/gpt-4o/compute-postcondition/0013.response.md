Postcondition: ***min_upvotes = x, max_upvotes = x + z, min_downvotes = y, max_downvotes = y + z. If max_upvotes is less than min_downvotes, then the program will retain the same state as the initial state. If max_upvotes is not less than min_downvotes, the relationship (max_downvotes >= min_upvotes) holds true after the if-else block executes.***
