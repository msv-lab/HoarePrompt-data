Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It considers all possible cases where the result could be "+", "-", "0", or "?", based on the values of x, y, and z. It accurately determines the result or reports uncertainty when there are multiple possible outcomes due to the unknown votes.

The program ensures that for each input of x, y, and z within the defined constraints, it outputs the correct result as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements.
