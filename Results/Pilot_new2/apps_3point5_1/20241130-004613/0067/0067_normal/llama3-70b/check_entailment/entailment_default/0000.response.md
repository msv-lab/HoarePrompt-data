Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z within the range of 0 to 100.
- It then compares these values and prints specific symbols based on the conditions outlined in the problem description.
- If x is greater than y + z, it prints '+', which aligns with the problem description.
- If x is less than y, it prints '-', which also aligns with the problem description.
- If x equals y and z is 0, it prints '0'. If z is not 0, it prints '?' as per the problem description.
- The code covers all the possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and hence is correct for all cases.
