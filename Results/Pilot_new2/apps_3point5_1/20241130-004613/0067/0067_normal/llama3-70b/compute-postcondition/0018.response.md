The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes into consideration the non-negative integers x, y, and z, such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function does not perform any operations and does not return any value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It simply considers the constraints that x, y, and z are non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 100.**
