The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `s` from the user input and converts it to its word representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word representation from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word representation from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the word representation by combining the words from the `tens` and `ones` lists. The function covers the conversion of integers to words from 0 to 99.
