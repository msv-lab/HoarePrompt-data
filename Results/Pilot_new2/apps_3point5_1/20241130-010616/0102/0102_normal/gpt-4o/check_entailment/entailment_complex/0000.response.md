Correctness: **True**

The annotated program accurately implements the problem description. It covers all the necessary conditions outlined in the problem description and correctly returns the word representation of the input integer within the specified range. The program accounts for numbers between 0 and 9, numbers between 11 and 19, and all other cases for numbers between 10 and 99. The concatenation of words for numbers between 10 and 99 is done using a hyphen as specified. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
