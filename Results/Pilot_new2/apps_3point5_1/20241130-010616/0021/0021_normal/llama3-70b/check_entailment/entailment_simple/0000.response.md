Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by finding their positions and then determining the maximum distance either by swapping 1 with another element or swapping n with another element. It then prints the maximum distance achievable with one swap. This logic holds true for all potential cases as it maximizes the distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap.
