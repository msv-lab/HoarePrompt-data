Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, computes the distances of these elements from the first and last positions, and then finds the maximum distance. The swap operation is not actually performed, but the maximum distance calculation is correct based on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements. The program outputs the correct maximum distance as required by the problem description for all potential cases. Hence, the program is correct.
