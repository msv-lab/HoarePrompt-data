Functionality: **The function reads an integer n and an array a containing n distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance of an element in the array from the first and last positions. The maximum distance is the maximum value among four distances calculated based on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array. Finally, the function prints the maximum distance. The function does not return any value.**
