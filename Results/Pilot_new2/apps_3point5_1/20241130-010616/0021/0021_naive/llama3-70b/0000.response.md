Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It first finds the positions of the minimum (integer 1) and maximum (integer n) elements in the input permutation. Then, it calculates the maximum and minimum distances that can be achieved by swapping the two elements. Finally, it prints the maximum of the two distances as the output.

The logic implemented in the program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It handles scenarios where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array, as well as cases where swapping the elements can increase the distance between them. Since the program performs the necessary calculations correctly and handles all possible scenarios, it can be deemed correct.
