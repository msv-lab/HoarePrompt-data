Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in a list of tuples representing the bus routes. It then calculates the time difference between the current time Serval goes to the station and the arrival time of the first bus of each route. It finds the route with the minimum time difference and prints the corresponding route number. The logic is consistent with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
