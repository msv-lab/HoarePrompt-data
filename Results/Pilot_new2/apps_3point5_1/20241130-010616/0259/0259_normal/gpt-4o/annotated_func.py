#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and bus_routes is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of that route.**

    min_wait_time = float('inf')
    chosen_route = -1
    for i in range(n):
        s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]
        
        if s_i >= t:
            wait_time = s_i - t
        elif (t - s_i) % d_i == 0:
            wait_time = 0
        else:
            wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions, `chosen_route` is equal to the route with the minimum wait time, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple for the chosen route, `d_i` is the second element of the tuple for the chosen route, `wait_time` is either equal to `min_wait_time` or the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions.
    return chosen_route
    #The program returns the route with the minimum wait time, which is stored in chosen_route. The chosen_route consists of two elements: s_i and d_i, where s_i is the starting point and d_i is the destination point of the route. The wait_time is either equal to min_wait_time or the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of that route. The function iterates through each bus route to calculate the minimum wait time based on the arrival time and interval. It then returns the route number (index + 1) with the minimum wait time. If there are multiple routes with the same minimum wait time, it returns the first encountered route.
