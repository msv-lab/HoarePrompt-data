Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. One case where the code fails is when there are multiple bus routes with the same minimum wait time. In such a scenario, the code should randomly choose one of the routes, however, the code always returns the first encountered route. This means that the code does not provide the correct output as per the problem description.
