Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in the number of bus routes `n`, the time Serval goes to the station `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` containing the arrival time and interval for each bus route. 

The function correctly calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route based on the conditions provided in the problem description. It then returns the route number with the minimum wait time.

The implementation follows the problem description accurately, iterating through each bus route and calculating the wait time correctly. Additionally, the program handles cases where Serval arrives before the first bus of a route, and cases where multiple buses arrive at the same time.

Therefore, the program is correct and outputs the correct bus route for Serval to take in all possible scenarios.
