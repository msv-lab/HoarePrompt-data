Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is equal to the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions, `chosen_route` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`. The wait time is either equal to `min_wait_time` or the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions.***
