Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`, and ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0) is false for the current values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. Additionally, `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
