Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input data about bus routes and calculates the next bus arrival time for each route based on a given time.
- The code then determines the index of the bus route with the minimum waiting time for the next bus arrival and prints it.
- The code handles the constraints on input values and considers cases where multiple buses may have the same minimum waiting time.
- The output hints also agree with the code and describe the functionality accurately. The code follows the problem description for every potential case, making it correct.
