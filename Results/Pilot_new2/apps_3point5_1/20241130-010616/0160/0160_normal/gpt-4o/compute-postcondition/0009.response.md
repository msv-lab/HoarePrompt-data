Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is an integer such that x >= 1, i is 2, math.sqrt(x) is calculated correctly, divisors now contains the updated values after adding x divided by i for each i when x is divisible by i, and divisors has the new value of i added to it. Additionally, divisors now contains the updated values after adding x divided by 2.***
