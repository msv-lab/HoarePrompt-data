The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer. The constraints for `x` are specified as N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, and A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N. After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted list of divisors of `x` in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x`, calculate its divisors, sort them, and return the sorted list in reverse order.
