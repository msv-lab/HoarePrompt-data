Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, divisors is an empty set, x is an integer such that x >= 1, i is 1, math.sqrt(x) is calculated correctly. The current value of x is divisible by i***
