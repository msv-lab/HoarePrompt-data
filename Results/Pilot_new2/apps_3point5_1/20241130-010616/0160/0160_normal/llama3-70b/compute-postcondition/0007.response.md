According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `i` from 1 to N-1. At the end of the last iteration, the states are Output State: N+1, K, A_i, gcd where gcd is updated with the new value after calculating math.gcd(gcd, A[i]), i+1. 
To execute the loop one more time, the new states should be:
State: **Output State: N+1, K, A_(i+1), math.gcd(gcd, A[i+1]), i+1**
