Output State: **`N, K, A_i, gcd` are integers. If gcd % i == 0 where i * i is not equal to gcd, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`. Adjust `i` to the next integer in the range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1 for which gcd % i == 0 and i * i is not equal to gcd. `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`.**
