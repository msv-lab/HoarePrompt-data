The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of squares of the first N positive integers, where N is an integer between 2 and 500. The function then multiplies the resulting sum by the integer K, which is between 0 and 10^9. Additionally, the function calculates the product of all elements in a list A, where the elements are integers between 1 and 10^6 for indices 1 to N. The function returns the sum of squares, the product of elements in list A, and the product of the sum of squares and K.
