Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values.
2. The program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list A.
3. It then finds the maximum divisor by iterating up to the square root of the gcd and checking for divisors.
4. The program prints the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
5. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
