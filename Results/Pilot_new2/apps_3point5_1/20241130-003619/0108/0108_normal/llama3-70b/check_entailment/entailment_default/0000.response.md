Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a string input and iterates over the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- For each character in the alphabet, it replaces that character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet.
- It constructs a result string containing all characters from the alphabet that were present in the input string before replacements.
- If the length of the result string is equal to 26 (length of the alphabet), it prints the result string.
- Otherwise, it prints -1.

The code fulfills the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly replaces characters to form a string that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The output hints also agree with the code's logic and confirm that it works as expected.
