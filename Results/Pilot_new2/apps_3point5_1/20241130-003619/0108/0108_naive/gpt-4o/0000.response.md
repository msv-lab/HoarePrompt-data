Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly iterates through the given string `s` and checks if it can form the English alphabet in order as a subsequence. It compares each character of `s` with the corresponding character in the English alphabet until it reaches the end of either string. If it successfully reaches the end of the English alphabet string, it prints the English alphabet. If not, it prints -1. The logic seems correct and covers all potential cases.
