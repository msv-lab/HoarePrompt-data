Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string and then iterates through it to check if the characters in the string can form the English alphabet as a subsequence. It does this by comparing each character in the input string with the characters in the target English alphabet. If at the end of the iteration, the English alphabet is a subsequence of the input string, it prints the English alphabet. Otherwise, it prints -1. The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem description.
