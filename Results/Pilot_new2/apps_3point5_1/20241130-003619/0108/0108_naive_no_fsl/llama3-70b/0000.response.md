Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input string `s` and iterates through the English alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces occurrences of that character in the input string `s` with the next character in alphabetical order. If the resulting string contains all 26 characters of the English alphabet, it prints the result, otherwise it prints -1.

This logic correctly follows the problem description as it ensures that the final output contains all the characters of the English alphabet in order. The program covers all possible cases and handles them correctly.
