Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use to cook the compote by finding the minimum of the quantities of each fruit that satisfies the ratio 1:2:4. It then calculates the total by multiplying the minimum of lemons with 1, apples with 2, and pears with 4, which is the correct way to calculate the maximum total number of fruits that can be used for the compote. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output.
