Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by calculating the minimum number of lemons based on the constraints given in the problem. It then calculates the total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote. The calculation `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` accurately represents the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the ratio specified in the problem. Hence, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
