Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has.
- It then calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the constraint that for each lemon there must be 2 apples and 4 pears.
- Finally, it prints the total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly handles the constraints and calculates the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote.
