Your Task Answer: 
According to the code, the loop can execute based on the elements in the list `digits`. Since `digits` contains the separate digits of the number `num`, for the loop to execute, `digits` must not be empty. Additionally, the number of elements in `used_cubes` should match the number of digits in `digits`, and all elements in `used_cubes` should be set to False at the start. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: 
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements (where n is the number of digits in `digits`) all set to False**
