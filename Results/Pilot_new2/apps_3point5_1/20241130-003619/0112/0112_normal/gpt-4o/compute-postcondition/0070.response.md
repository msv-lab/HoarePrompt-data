The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha got for her birthday. Each cube has 6 faces with a single digit from 0 to 9 on each face. 

After executing the function body, there are multiple return points:
- Case 1: The program returns False if 'found' remains False after the loop finishes.
- Case 2: The program returns False if no match was found in any iteration.
- Case 3: The program returns False.
- Case 4: The program returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to determine if it is possible to form a number using the digits on the faces of the cubes. It returns True if a match is found, and False if no match is found or if 'found' remains False after the loop finishes.
