According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with the ith element set to True, `found` is True, `i` is less than n+1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted by increasing it by 1.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with the ith element set to True, `found` is True, `i` must be less than n+2**
