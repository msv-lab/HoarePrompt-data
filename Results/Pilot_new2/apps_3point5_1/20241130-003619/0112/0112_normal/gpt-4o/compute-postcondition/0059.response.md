According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing at least one more digit, all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True, `found` is True, there are more digits left in the `digits` list, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited after the if condition is satisfied. Additionally, after the if condition is satisfied, `used_cubes[i]` becomes True and `found` is still True.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing at least one more digit, all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True, `found` is True, there are more digits left in the `digits` list, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited after the if condition is satisfied. Additionally, after the if condition is satisfied, `used_cubes[i]` becomes True and `found` is still True**.
