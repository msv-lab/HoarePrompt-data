Functionality: ** The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num`, representing the number of cubes Masha received for her birthday. Each cube has 6 faces with a single digit from 0 to 9. The function iterates through the digits of `num` and checks if each digit can be formed using the faces of the cubes. If a match is found for each digit, the function returns True. If no match is found for a digit in any iteration, the function returns False. **

The function has potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The code does not account for the scenario where the number of cubes is insufficient to form all the digits in `num`.
- If the number of cubes is less than the number of unique digits in `num`, the function should return False, but this is not included in the current implementation.
