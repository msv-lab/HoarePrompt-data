Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing at least one more digit, all elements in `used_cubes` are set to True, `found` is True, there are more digits left in the `digits` list, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. After the if condition is satisfied, `used_cubes[i]` becomes True and `found` is still True.***
