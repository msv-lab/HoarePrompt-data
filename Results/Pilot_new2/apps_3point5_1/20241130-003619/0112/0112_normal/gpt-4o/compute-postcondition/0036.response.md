Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `found` is True, at least one more digit left in the `digits` list, `i+1` is within the range of `n`, `used_cubes[i+1]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i+1], and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
