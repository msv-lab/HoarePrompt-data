Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads the input correctly, processes the cubes to find unique digits excluding '0', and then calculates the maximum number that can be formed by arranging these digits in descending order. It prints this maximum number as the output, which aligns with the problem description. The program covers all possible cases within the given constraints and provides the correct output according to the problem requirements.
