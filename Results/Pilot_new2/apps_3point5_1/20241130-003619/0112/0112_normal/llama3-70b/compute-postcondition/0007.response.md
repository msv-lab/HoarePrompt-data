According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `cubes`. If there are more lists of integers in `cubes`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes must have at least 2 lists of integers, cube is the second list in cubes, and digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the second cube. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are at least 3 lists of integers in `cubes`, and the cube being accessed is the third list in cubes, and the set `digits` is updated to include the string representation of each digit in the third cube.

State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes must have at least 3 lists of integers, cube is the third list in cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the third cube**
