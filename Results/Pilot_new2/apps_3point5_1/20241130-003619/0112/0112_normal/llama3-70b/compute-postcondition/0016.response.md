Functionality: The function `func` reads input from the user, including an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3) followed by n lines, each containing 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes. It then creates a set of unique digits excluding '0' from the cubes and finds the maximum number that can be formed by arranging these digits in descending order. Finally, it prints the calculated maximum number.

Potential Edge Case: The code does not handle a scenario where there are less than n lines of integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes. It assumes there will always be at least n lines of input.
