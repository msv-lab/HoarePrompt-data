According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since n is between 1 and 3, cubes will have n lists of integers. Therefore, for the loop to execute, cubes must have at least 1 list of integers. At the start of the loop, the digits set is empty. So, before the loop starts, cubes must have at least 1 list of integers, cube is the first list in cubes, and digits is an empty set.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes must have at least 1 list of integers, cube is the first list in cubes, `digits` is an empty set**
