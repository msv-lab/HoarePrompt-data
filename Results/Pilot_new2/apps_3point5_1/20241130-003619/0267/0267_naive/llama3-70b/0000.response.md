Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function `count` calculates the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in a given range, and this is used to calculate the final sum by subtracting the count for $l-1$ from the count for $r$. The modulo operation is correctly applied at the end as per the problem description. The program considers all possible cases and works correctly for all inputs within the given constraints.
