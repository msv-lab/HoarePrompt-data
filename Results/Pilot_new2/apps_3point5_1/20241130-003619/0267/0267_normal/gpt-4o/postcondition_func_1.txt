The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= 10. It iterates over numbers from `l` to `r`, calculates the total sum of numbers that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` is true, and returns the updated value of `total_sum` after taking the sum modulo `MOD`.
