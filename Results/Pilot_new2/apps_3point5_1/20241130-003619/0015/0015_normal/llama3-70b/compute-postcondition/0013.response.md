Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The values of a, b, and c are assigned by the user input after splitting them by spaces. Initially, if c == 0, then if a equals b, 'YES' is printed. If a does not equal b, 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to 0, then if (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, 'YES' is printed. If the condition is not met, 'NO' is printed.***
