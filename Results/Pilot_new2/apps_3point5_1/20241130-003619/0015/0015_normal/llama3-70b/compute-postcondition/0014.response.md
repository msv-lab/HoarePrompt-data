The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any inputs. The function returns the sum of variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the sum of integers `a`, `b`, and `c` without taking any parameters.
