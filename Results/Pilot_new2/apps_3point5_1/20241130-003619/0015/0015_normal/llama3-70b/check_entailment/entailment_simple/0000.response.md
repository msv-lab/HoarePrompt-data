Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and if the division result is non-negative, then it prints "YES", indicating that b appears in the sequence. Otherwise, it prints "NO". This logic aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description for determining if Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence.
