Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string of characters 'D' or 'R'. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the input string, compares them, and prints 'D' if the count of 'D' is greater than 'R', otherwise it prints 'R'. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
