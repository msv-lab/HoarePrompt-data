Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `d_index` is the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the value popped from the beginning of `r_queue`, `r_queue` has been modified by removing the element at index 0. In the if part, `d_queue` has a new element appended which is `d_index` + `n`. In the else part, `r_queue` is modified where the element at index 0 is removed, and `r_queue` now contains the result of appending `r_index + n`.***
