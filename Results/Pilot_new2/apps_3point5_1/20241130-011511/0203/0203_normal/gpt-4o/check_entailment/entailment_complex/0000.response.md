Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It categorizes the employees into two queues based on their fractions ('D' or 'R'). It then processes these queues by comparing the indices of the employees and adjusting them based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Finally, it determines the outcome of the vote based on the state of the queues.

The program ensures that each employee who is denied the right to vote does not participate further in the voting process, which aligns with the rules of the voting procedure described in the problem description. It correctly predicts the outcome of the vote based on the final state of the queues.

Therefore, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
