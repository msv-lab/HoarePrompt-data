Output State: **The program returns the total time taken to move from block_a to block_b considering the floor transitions and walking time, where direct_walk_time is calculated as the absolute value of (block_a - block_b) modulo n multiplied by 15, reverse_walk_time is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) modulo n multiplied by 15, min_walk_time is the minimum value between direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time, time_to_target_floor is (floor_b - 1) * 5, and total_time is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.**
