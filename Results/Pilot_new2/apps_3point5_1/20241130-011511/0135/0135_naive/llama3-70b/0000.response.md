Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of division n by i, and checks if the remainder is already seen before. If a remainder is found to be repeated, it prints "No" and exits the program. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" after checking all remainders. This logic ensures that all remainders are distinct as required by the problem description. The program covers all potential cases where there might be repeating remainders and handles them appropriately.
