The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, stores these remainders in a set `seen`, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not explicitly return a value, but it handles the input and output logic based on the remainders calculated. It ensures `n` and `k` are integers in the range 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.
