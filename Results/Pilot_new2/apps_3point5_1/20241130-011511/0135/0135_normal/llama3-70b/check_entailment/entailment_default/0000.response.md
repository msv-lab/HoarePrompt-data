Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder is repeated.
- It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the remainders seen so far and exits early if a repeated remainder is found. If no repeated remainders are found, it prints 'Yes'.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that all remainders are distinct and prints 'Yes' if they are, and 'No' otherwise.
- The output hints also accurately describe the functionality of the code, confirming that it aligns with the problem description.
