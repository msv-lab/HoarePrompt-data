Postcondition: ***T must be a positive integer, n is updated based on the input values, x is assigned the second input value, s contains the input value, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance = cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. Otherwise, if (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, print -1 is executed. Otherwise, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed.***
