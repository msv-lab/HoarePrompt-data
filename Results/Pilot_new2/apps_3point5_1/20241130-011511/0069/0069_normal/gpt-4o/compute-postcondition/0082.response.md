According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. The loop starts from 1 and goes up to n (inclusive). The prefix_balances is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1, so it should have n + 1 elements. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
