Output State: **All variables maintain their original relationships and values, `prefix_balances` is fully updated according to the provided code in the loop. If the balance is equal to 0, then the current value of the balance is 0. After the if-else block executes, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, the results list will have -1 appended to it. Otherwise, if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, the results list will have 0 appended to it. In the else part, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which the conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) are satisfied. The list `prefix_balances` will have at least 0 elements, and `x`, `balance`, and the elements in `prefix_balances` will remain unchanged. The results list will contain the appended `count` after the else part is executed. n is assigned the value of int(data[index]).**
