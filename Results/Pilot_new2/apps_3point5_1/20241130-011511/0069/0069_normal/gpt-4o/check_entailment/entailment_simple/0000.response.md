Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with the desired balance $x$. It follows the problem description by calculating the running balance of each prefix using the formula provided. It then checks if there are any prefixes with the desired balance $x$ and counts the number of such prefixes. If the balance is 0, it correctly handles the case where there might be an infinite number of such prefixes.

The program ensures that it calculates the number of prefixes as described in the problem statement and handles the infinite case correctly. Hence, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
