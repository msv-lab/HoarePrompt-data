The function `func_1` reads input data, processes it based on certain conditions, and prints results. It accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), x (an integer), and s (a binary string of length n). The function calculates balances, checks conditions, and appends results accordingly. The function does not have a specified return value. Missing functionality includes handling cases where certain conditions are not met based on the annotations.
