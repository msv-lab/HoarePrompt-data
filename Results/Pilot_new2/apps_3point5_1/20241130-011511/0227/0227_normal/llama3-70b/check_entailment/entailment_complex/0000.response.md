Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, sorts the list `a`, and then calculates the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations. The program iterates over the sorted list and increments `m` whenever an element `a[i]` is not twice the value of the previous element `a[i-1] + 1`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` or -1 if it exceeds 23.

The program covers all potential cases as it considers the condition for all elements in the list `a` to be distinct positive integers. The algorithm used in the program ensures that the operations can be performed as described in the problem statement.
