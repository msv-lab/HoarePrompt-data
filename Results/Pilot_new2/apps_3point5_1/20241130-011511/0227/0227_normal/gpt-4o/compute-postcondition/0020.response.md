Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `assigned` is a set containing all elements of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is the index of the last element in list `a`, `can_form` is True, `x` is the last element in the set `assigned`. The loop has iterated over all elements in `assigned` and checked if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, and `can_form` is set to True if any such pair exists. In the current state, `can_form` is False.***
