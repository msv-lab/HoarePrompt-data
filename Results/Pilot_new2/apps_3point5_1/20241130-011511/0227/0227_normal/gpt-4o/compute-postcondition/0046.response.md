According to the code, the loop can execute only if the set `assigned` is not empty. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `assigned` is a set containing all elements of list `a` and is not empty, `m` is 3, `i` is the index of the last element in list `a` plus 1, `x` is the last element in the set `assigned`, `can_form` is False**
