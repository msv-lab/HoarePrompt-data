The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `a`. Parameter `n` is a positive integer, and parameter `a` is a list of distinct positive integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of elements in list `a`, which is represented by variable `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the number of elements in list `a` as `m`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a. It returns the number of elements in list a as m.**
