Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the start time and the frequency of each bus route. The function calculates the minimum wait time for the buses based on the current time and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route with the shortest wait time. If all buses require an infinite wait time, it returns -1, although this scenario is not explicitly handled in the code. **
