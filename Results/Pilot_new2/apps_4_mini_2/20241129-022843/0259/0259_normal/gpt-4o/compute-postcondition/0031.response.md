The value of `wait_time` is assigned the result of the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` and `d_i` are obtained from `bus_routes[i]`, the calculation will depend on the specific values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `chosen_route` remains unchanged, `i` is now greater than or equal to 1, `s_i, d_i` is assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
