The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of -1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, or `min_wait_time`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1**.
