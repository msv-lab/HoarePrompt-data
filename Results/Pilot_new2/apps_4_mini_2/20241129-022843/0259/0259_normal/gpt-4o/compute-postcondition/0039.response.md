The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
- `t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 100000 \).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers \( s_i \) and \( d_i \) such that \( 1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 100000 \).

After executing the function body, it returns the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time, which is stored in `chosen_route`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`, and return the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, t, and bus_routes, and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time.**
