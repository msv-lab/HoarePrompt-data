Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is set to 1, and `i` remains 0, with `s_i` as the first element of `bus_routes[0]` and `d_i` as the second element of `bus_routes[0]`.***
