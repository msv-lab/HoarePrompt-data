Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, if `(t - s_i)` is not divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.***
