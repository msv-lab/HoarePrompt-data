Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from all bus routes, `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time, if no wait time was found that is less than infinity, `min_wait_time` remains float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1.**
