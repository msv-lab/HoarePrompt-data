The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Here, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]` and `t` is a positive integer. Therefore, the value of `wait_time` depends on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Given that `s_i` is derived from the list `bus_routes`, we can express `wait_time` as the difference between this element and `t`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is updated if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is set to 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.**
