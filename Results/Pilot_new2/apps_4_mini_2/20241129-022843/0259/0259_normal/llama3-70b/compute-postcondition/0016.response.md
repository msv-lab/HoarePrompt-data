Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, and `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`. The current value of `time` is less than `min_time`.***
