According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the variable `n` is still greater than the number of iterations that have already been completed. Given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, and we are currently at the end of the previous iteration, it is presumed that one iteration has been completed. Thus, `n` must be greater than the current number of iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, and since one iteration has been completed, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to reflect that one iteration has been completed (i.e., `n` should be decremented by 1), leading to `n` being at least 2. The variable `_` being a throwaway variable does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is a list containing two tuples: the original tuple `(s, d)` and the new tuple `(s, d)`**
