According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The variable `buses` is an empty list, and its state does not influence the execution of the loop directly. Since the loop is set to iterate `n` times, the conditions for `n` are already satisfied, and there are no other variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The loop does not have any loop variables that would change within the loop body, so there are no additional states that need to be established for the loop's execution other than confirming that `n` is within its defined range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is an empty list**
