The value of `ans` is assigned -1. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `buses`, and `min_time`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples `(s, d)`; `min_time` is set to float('inf'); `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples `(s, d)`; `min_time` is set to float('inf'); `ans` is -1.**
