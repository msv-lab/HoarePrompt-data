The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initialized to 1, the value of `ans` thus becomes `1 + 1`, which equals `2`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`, `min_time` is equal to `time`, and now `ans` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`, `min_time` is equal to `time`, `ans` is 2**.
