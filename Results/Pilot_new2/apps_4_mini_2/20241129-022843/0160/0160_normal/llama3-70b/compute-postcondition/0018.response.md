According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to and including `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. The current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration determines what the next value of `i` will be. 

Since the loop iterates over the range starting from 1, if `i` is currently at the last iteration value, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. The next value of `i` will thus be `i + 1`.

Furthermore, for the loop to execute again, the condition `i < int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` must still hold true. If `i` was the last integer value before reaching `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, the loop will not execute again as `i` will equal `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` after the increment. 

At the end of the last iteration, we can deduce that `gcd` is such that it is greater than or equal to `i * i` and the loop could potentially execute one final time if `i` was less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

Thus, if the loop is to execute one more time, then after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` must be equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` and for the loop to execute one more time, `gcd` must be at least `i * i`, where `i` is now incremented.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` positive integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, and `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.**
