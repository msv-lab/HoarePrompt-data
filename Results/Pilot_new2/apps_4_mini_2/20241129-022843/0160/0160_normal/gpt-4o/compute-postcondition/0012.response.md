The value of `divisors` is modified by adding the result of `x // i` to it. Given that `x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N, which is between 2 and 500, and `i` is equal to `sqrt_x + 1`, the expression `x // i` denotes the integer division of the tuple `x` by `i`. 

Since `x` must be at least 4, the first element of the tuple (N) will determine the value of `i` based on `sqrt_x`. The value of `divisors` is updated accordingly.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`x` is a tuple with first element N (2 <= N <= 500), second element K (0 <= K <= 10^9), third element as a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); `i` is `sqrt_x + 1`; `divisors` now includes the value `x // i` added to it.**
