The code adds the current value of `i` to the `divisors` set. Since `i` is initialized to 1, the set `divisors` will now contain the value 1. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6), `divisors` contains {1}, `i` is 1, `N` is at least 2, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `(x % i == 0)`).**
