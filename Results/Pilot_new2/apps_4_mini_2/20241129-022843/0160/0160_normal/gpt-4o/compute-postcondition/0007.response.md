The code snippet `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to the set `divisors`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the `divisors` set. Assuming `divisors` was undefined before this operation, it will now be defined as a set containing the element 2. The initial state for `x` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6), and `x` must be at least 4; `i` is 2; `divisors` is a set containing the element 2.**
