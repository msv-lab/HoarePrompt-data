#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where the first two integers represent N (the number of elements) and K (the maximum number of operations), followed by N integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and 0 <= K <= 10^9.
def func_1(lst):
    gcd_result = lst[0]
    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers where the first integer N is greater than or equal to 1; `gcd_result` is equal to the GCD of all elements from `A_1` to `A_N`.
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns the GCD of all elements from A_1 to A_N in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` where the first integer represents N (the number of elements) and the subsequent integers represent a sequence of integers. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers from the list, starting from the second element to the N-th element. The function assumes that N is at least 2, and thus it does not handle cases where the list may have fewer than two integers. If the list contains only one integer (which is not allowed by the provided conditions), the behavior is not defined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6).
def func_2(x):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` (the first element of the tuple), including 1 and `x` itself. If `x` is 1, then `divisors` contains only {1}.
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list of all divisors of the first element N of the tuple x in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `x` where the first element is an integer `N` (between 2 and 500), the second element is an integer `K` (between 0 and 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` integers. It calculates and returns a sorted list of all divisors of `N` in descending order. If `N` is 1, the output will still be {1}. However, the function does not utilize the second and third elements of the tuple `x`.
