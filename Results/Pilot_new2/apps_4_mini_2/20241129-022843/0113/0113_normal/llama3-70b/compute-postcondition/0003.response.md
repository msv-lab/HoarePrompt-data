The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer not divisible by \(10^k\) for \(k\) in the range [1, 8], it remains a positive integer after the increment. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not divisible by \(10^k\) for \(k\) in the range [1, 8], `n` is incremented by 1.**
