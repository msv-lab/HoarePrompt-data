To verify the correctness of the provided program, we first analyze the logic against the problem description.

The problem requires finding the minimum positive integer \( x \) such that:
1. \( x \) ends with \( k \) or more zeros in base 10.
2. \( x \) is divisible by \( n \).

The program defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that calculates a multiplier as \( 10^k \) and computes the value of \( x \) using the formula:
```python
x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
```
This formula is intended to ensure that \( x \) is a multiple of \( n \) while also being adjusted to ensure it meets the requirement of ending with \( k \) zeros.

### Analysis of the Program:
- If \( k = 0 \), the requirement is simply that \( x \) is divisible by \( n \). The program handles this correctly since any number is divisible by itself. Therefore, it returns \( x = n \), which is correct for \( k = 0 \).
  
- If \( k > 0 \), the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of \( n \) and \( 10^k \) using the relationship:
  \[
  LCM(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{GCD(a, b)}
  \]
  This ensures that the resulting \( x \) will be the smallest multiple of \( n \) that is also a multiple of \( 10^k \), effectively ensuring it ends with at least \( k \) zeros.

### Edge Cases:
1. When \( n \) itself is a multiple of \( 10^k \), \( x \) should return \( n \) because it is already the minimum number.
2. When \( n \) is a large number close to \( 10^9 \), it is essential to ensure that the calculations do not exceed limits and remain efficient.

### Verification of Examples:
The provided examples in the problem statement:
- Input: `375 4`, Output: `30000` (Correct)
- Input: `10000 1`, Output: `10000` (Correct)
- Input: `38101 0`, Output: `38101` (Correct)
- Input: `123456789 8`, Output: `12345678900000000` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and the provided examples, it appears that the logic used in the code correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Thus, we conclude that the program works as intended.

Correctness: **True**
