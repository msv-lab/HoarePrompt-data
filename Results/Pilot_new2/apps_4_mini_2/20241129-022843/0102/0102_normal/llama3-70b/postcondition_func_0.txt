The function accepts an integer input `s` from the user (expected to be between 0 and 99) and prints its English word representation. For values from 0 to 9, it retrieves the corresponding string from the `ones` list; for values from 10 to 19, it retrieves the string from the `teens` list; for values from 20 to 99, it constructs the representation using the `tens` list and the `ones` list, separating tens and ones with a hyphen if necessary. The function does not handle input validation or cases where the input is outside the expected range.
