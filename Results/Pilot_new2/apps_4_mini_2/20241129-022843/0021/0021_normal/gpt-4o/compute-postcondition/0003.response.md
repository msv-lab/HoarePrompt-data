The variable `max_pos` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be in the range from 1 to `n` and is distinct within the list, the position returned by `a.index(n)` will be valid. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`.**
