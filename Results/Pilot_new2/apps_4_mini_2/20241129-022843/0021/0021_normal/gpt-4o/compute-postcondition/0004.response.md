The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`, which calculates the absolute distance from index 0 to the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The variable `max_pos` is defined as the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, and since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, `max_pos` will be a valid index in the range of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`.**
