The code updates the `digits` set with string representations of each integer in the `cube` list. Since `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, it is composed of integers between 0 and 9. The `digits` set will now contain string representations of these integers. The other variables (`n` and `cubes`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `cubes` is a list of at least 3 lists containing integers between 0 and 9; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` now includes string representations of integers in `cube`.**
