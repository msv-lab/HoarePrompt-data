According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has more than 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is equal to 2, which means that there are 2 lists in `cubes`. The variable `cube` is currently the second list in `cubes`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the next list in `cubes`. Since `n` is equal to 2, `cubes` only has 2 lists, and `cube` is the second one. Thus, for the loop to execute once more, `cubes` must have at least 3 lists, and `cube` would then be the third list in the `cubes`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `cubes` is a list of at least 3 lists containing integers between 0 and 9; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`.**
