The code `break` is executed, which means that the control flow is exiting the most immediate loop or conditional block in which it resides. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this command, but the program will no longer continue executing statements within that loop or block. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are breaking out of the current loop or conditional block while keeping the rest of the variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where at least one index is True, `found` is True, `used_cubes[i]` is now True, `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
