The code assigns the value `True` to the variable `found`. The previous state of `found` is now overridden, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least one character; `digit` is the first character in `digits`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False` except for the last index `n-1`, which is now `True`; `i` is now equal to `n`; `found` is now `True`.**
