Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `i` is 2, and if `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True and `found` is set to True, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
