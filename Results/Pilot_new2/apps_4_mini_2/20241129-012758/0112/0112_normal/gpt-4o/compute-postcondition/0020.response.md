Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least one character; `digit` is the first character in `digits`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, where at least one index is `True` (indicating that the corresponding cube has been used), and the rest may be `False`; `found` is `True` if `digit` has been found in any of the `cube_faces` that correspond to the indexes of `used_cubes`, and `False` otherwise.**
