According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. Additionally, before the loop, the variable `i` is not initialized. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to its initial value of 0 as it will start from 0 in the first iteration. 

Furthermore, the state of `used_cubes` being a list of length `n` filled with `False` is appropriate, and `found` being `False` does not affect the loop's execution. 

Overall, the states that need to be included for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0**
