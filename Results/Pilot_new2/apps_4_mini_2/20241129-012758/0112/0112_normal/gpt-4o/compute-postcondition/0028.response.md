The statement `used_cubes[i] = True` modifies the value of `used_cubes` at index `i`. Given that the current value of `used_cubes[i]` was `False`, it is now changed to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where at least one index is `True`, `found` is False, and `used_cubes[0]` is now True while `digit` is present in `cube_faces[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where at least one index is True, `found` is False, and `used_cubes[i]` is now True while `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]**.
