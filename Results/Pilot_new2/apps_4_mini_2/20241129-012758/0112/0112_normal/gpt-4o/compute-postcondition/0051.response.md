`found` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the Output State will reflect the updated value of `found` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`.**
