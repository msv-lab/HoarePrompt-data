Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where at least one index is True. If `used_cubes[1]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, at least one index in `used_cubes` remains True, and `found` is True, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
