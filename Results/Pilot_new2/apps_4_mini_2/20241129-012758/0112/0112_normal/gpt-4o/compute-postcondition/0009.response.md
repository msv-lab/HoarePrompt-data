Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least one character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
