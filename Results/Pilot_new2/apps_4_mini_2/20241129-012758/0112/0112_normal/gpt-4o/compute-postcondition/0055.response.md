The variable `used_cubes[i]` is assigned the value `True`. The initial constraints indicate that `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and `i` has been updated to `i + 1`, meaning `i` is now greater than its previous value. Since `n` must remain greater than `i + 1`, the valid range for `n` is determined based on the updated value of `i`.

The output state now reflects that `used_cubes[i]` is `True`, while keeping all other preconditions valid. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1.**
