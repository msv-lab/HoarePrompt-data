According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3\). Given that `used_cubes[i]` is initially set to `False` for each `i`, we need to ensure that `i` can be incremented for another iteration.

The current value of `i` determines how many iterations have already been completed. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute one more time. After the last iteration ends, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next potential iteration.

To summarize, if `i` is the current iteration, we can conclude:

1. If `i` is 0, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 1 (the next index).
2. If `i` is 1, `i` should become 2.
3. If `i` is 2, the loop cannot execute again because \(i\) would equal \(n\) (thus violating the loop condition).

Given that \(n\) can be at most 3, if `i` is currently 2, then the loop cannot go again, and if it is 1 or below, it can.

Thus, if we assume that `i` was 0 or 1 at the end of the last iteration, the states would adjust accordingly. Specifically, if `i` was 1, it would increment to 2 for the next iteration, and the loop could still run if \(n \geq 2\).

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can simply represent the state generically:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least one character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, and `i` is incremented by 1 (where `i` must be less than `n`)**.
