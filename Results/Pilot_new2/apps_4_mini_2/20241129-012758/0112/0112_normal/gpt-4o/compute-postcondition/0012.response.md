The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least one character; `digit` is the first character in `digits`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False` except for index `i`, which is now `True`; `i` has been incremented by 1 and is less than `n`; `found` is True.
