To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure it adheres to the problem description's requirements. The goal is to compute the sum of all integers from \( l \) to \( r \) that contain at most \( k \) distinct digits, and return this sum modulo \( 998244353 \).

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Functionality Overview**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1(l, r, k)` which relies on a nested function `count(n, k, dp)` to compute a value based on \( n \) and \( k \).
   - Specifically, the `count` function seems to be counting how many numbers up to \( n \) have at most \( k \) different digits.

2. **Count Logic**:
   - The function initializes cases when \( k = 0 \) and checks if the value has been computed previously using a memoization dictionary `dp`.
   - For numbers less than \( 10^k \), it returns \( n \), which seems to imply that it considers all such numbers valid since they would have fewer than \( k \) digits.
   - It uses a formula involving powers of 10 and sums up contributions from various ranges based on \( k \), but the correctness of this logic is not clear.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not appear to explicitly filter numbers based on whether they have at most \( k \) distinct digits. The counting logic might not account for all valid numbers in the range \( l \) to \( r \) correctly.
   - For example, if \( k = 2 \) and the range includes numbers like `101` and `110`, both of which have 2 distinct digits, but the counting mechanism may fail to include all such numbers in the range due to the logic used in the count function.

### Example Case
- Consider the input \( l = 100, r = 105, k = 2 \):
  - The valid numbers are `100`, `101`, `102`, `103`, `104`, `105` — all of which have at most 2 distinct digits.
  - The expected output should be \( 100 + 101 + 102 + 103 + 104 + 105 = 615 \).
  
However, it's unclear if the counting logic in `count` properly accounts for all these valid numbers, particularly because the function computes counts without explicitly generating or checking each number’s digit composition for distinct digit count.

### Conclusion
Given that the program may not accurately compute the sum for all valid numbers meeting the distinct digit condition, it is possible to encounter cases where it does not return the correct result based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
