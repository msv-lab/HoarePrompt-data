Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(l, r, k)` is expected to calculate the sum of all numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits, and return that sum modulo `998244353`. However, the implementation focuses on counting numbers based on the number of different digits without summing the actual values of those numbers.

Here are specific issues with the program:

1. **Counting vs. Summing**: The main function `func_1` calls `count(r, k, dp)` and `count(l - 1, k, dp)`, which only count the numbers that meet the digit condition. The problem requires the calculation of the sum of these numbers, not just their count. The difference between two counts does not give any information about the actual values of the numbers that would sum to the required result.

2. **Logic of `count` function**: The logic inside the `count` function does not account for the actual numbers that can be formed with at most `k` different digits. It attempts to calculate how many numbers up to `n` use at most `k` distinct digits, but fails to accumulate their values for summing.

3. **Missing Summation Implementation**: There is no mechanism to actually iterate through the range `[l, r]` and sum the valid numbers, which is crucial for achieving the goal specified in the problem description.

Because of these reasons, the program does not implement the functionality as described in the problem statement. It does not produce the correct output, thereby failing to meet the problem requirements.
