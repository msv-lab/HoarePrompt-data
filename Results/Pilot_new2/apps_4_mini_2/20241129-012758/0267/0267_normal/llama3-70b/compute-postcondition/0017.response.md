The variable `dp[n, k]` is updated according to the expression. The expression contains the calculation of `(10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`. 

- The term `10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)` simplifies to `9 * 10 ** (k - 2)`, since `10 ** (k - 1) = 10 * 10 ** (k - 2)` and the subtraction results in `9 * 10 ** (k - 2)`.
- The term `n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1` represents the integer division of `n` by `10 ** (k - 1)` and subtracts 1 from that result.

Thus, `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (k - 2) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)` to its previous value. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18; `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10; `n` is greater than or equal to 10; `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 ** (k - 2) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.**
