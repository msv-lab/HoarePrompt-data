The function accepts an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and returns `True` if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not take into account the bounds of `n` being between `l` and `r`, as stated in the annotations, since it operates solely on the value of `n` provided to it.
