Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle cases efficiently or correctly, especially for large ranges. The key issue is in `func_2`, where it iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`. This is not feasible for large values of `r`, especially given the constraints (up to \(10^{18}\)). 

For example, if you take the input:
```
l = 1
r = 1000000000000000000
k = 1
```
The function would attempt to iterate through \(10^{18}\) numbers to calculate the sum, which is not possible in a reasonable time frame. Additionally, even if we assume that `func_1` works correctly for each individual number, the iteration is still incomplete for handling larger ranges because it doesn't optimize the process of checking which numbers have at most `k` different digits.

Moreover, there is no optimization or algorithm that takes into account the characteristics of numbers with `k` distinct digits in an efficient manner, which is crucial given the possible input size. 

Thus, the implementation does not satisfy the requirements laid out in the problem description for all potential cases, particularly when the range is extensive.
