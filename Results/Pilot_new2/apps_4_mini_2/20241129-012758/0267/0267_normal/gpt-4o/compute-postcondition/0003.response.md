The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Given that `total_sum` is initially 0 and `num` is equal to `l`, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`. Other variables such as `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged in their states. 

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is equal to `l % MOD, `num` is currently equal to `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true.**
