The function `func` accepts three positive integers, which represent the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be made, where each set requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The minimum number of complete sets is determined by taking the smallest value from `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The function then calculates the total number of fruits used in these complete sets and prints the result, which is given by the formula `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, equivalent to `min_lemon * 7` (since each set consists of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).

It is important to note that the function does not accept parameters directly; rather, it prompts the user for input values. Consequently, there is no handling of cases where the user might input non-positive integers or non-integer values, which could lead to errors.

Functionality: ** The function reads three positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, computes the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be created, and prints the total number of fruits used in those sets. It does not handle invalid input cases, such as non-positive integers or non-integer values. **
