The value of `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that should be a positive integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `c` remain the same as they were not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state reflects that `b` is now set to the positive integer input.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is a positive integer representing the number of pears.**
