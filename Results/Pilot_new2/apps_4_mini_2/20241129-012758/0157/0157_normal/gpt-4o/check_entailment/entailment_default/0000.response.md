To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description:
Nikolay has a number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). The required ratio for making compote is 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote.

### Program:
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads three integers, which align with the description.
  
2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**: The line `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly calculates how many complete sets of fruits can be used based on the constraints provided by the ratios. 
   - `a` limits the number of lemons.
   - `b // 2` ensures there are enough apples (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon).
   - `c // 4` ensures there are enough pears (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: The total number of fruits used is calculated correctly as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of fruits which can be used to make the compote.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Insufficient Fruits**: If any of the fruits are insufficient to meet the required ratio, the program should output `0`. 
- **Minimum Input Values**: The code assumes positive integers, but if we take the minimum value of 1 for each fruit, it should correctly return 0 as they can't form any complete set (since we need at least 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).

### Output Hints:
The output hints suggest the function calculates the maximum possible combinations based on the input and directly prints the result. It states that no validation for input ranges is implemented, which aligns with how the input is processed (the problem description guarantees valid input).

### Test Cases:
1. For the input `2, 5, 7`, the program calculates:
   - `max_lemons = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
   - Total fruits = `1 * 7 = 7` (expected output)
   
2. For the input `4, 7, 13`, the program calculates:
   - `max_lemons = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
   - Total fruits = `3 * 7 = 21` (expected output)
   
3. For the input `2, 3, 2`, the program calculates:
   - `max_lemons = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
   - Total fruits = `0 * 7 = 0` (expected output)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints are consistent with the described functionality and the provided examples confirm that the implementation meets the requirements without missing any edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
