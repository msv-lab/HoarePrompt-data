The variable `total_fruits` is assigned the value of `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which can be simplified to `max_lemons * 7`. The value of `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, which means `max_lemons` is equal to the smallest of these three calculated values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input positive integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`.**
