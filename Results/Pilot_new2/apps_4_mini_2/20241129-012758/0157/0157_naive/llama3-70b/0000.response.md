Correctness: **True**.

The given program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) and calculates the maximum number of each fruit that can be used in the compote based on the required ratio of 1:2:4. 

The line `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly determines how many sets of fruits can be used based on the available quantities. It ensures that there are enough apples and pears to match the number of lemons, enforcing the ratios required by the recipe. The calculation for the total fruits used (`min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`) correctly sums the total number of fruits based on the minimum number of complete sets that can be made.

All provided example cases are handled correctly:
1. For input `2, 5, 7`, the program calculates that 1 set can be made (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears), resulting in a total of 7 fruits.
2. For input `4, 7, 13`, it determines that 3 sets can be made (3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears), resulting in a total of 21 fruits.
3. For input `2, 3, 2`, it finds that no complete sets can be made due to insufficient pears, resulting in a total of 0 fruits.

Since the program correctly implements the logic according to the problem description and handles all edge cases as required, it is deemed correct.
