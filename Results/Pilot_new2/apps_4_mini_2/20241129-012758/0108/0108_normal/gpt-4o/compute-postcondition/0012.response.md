The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it will take on the value of 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length at least 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is now 2; `j` is now greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 26. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, the condition holds true; otherwise, there is no else part to consider.
