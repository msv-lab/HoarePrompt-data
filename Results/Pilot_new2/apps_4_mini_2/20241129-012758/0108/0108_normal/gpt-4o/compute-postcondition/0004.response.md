To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run.

The loop condition is `i < len(s) and j < target_len`. 

1. `len(s)` is guaranteed to be at least 1 since `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000. Therefore, `i` must be less than the length of `s` for the first iteration to proceed.
2. `target_len` is a constant value of 26, which means that `j` must be less than 26 for the loop to execute.

Right before the loop:
- `i` is 0, which is valid because it is less than any non-zero length of `s`.
- `j` is 0, which is valid because it is less than `target_len` (26).

Since both conditions (`i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`) are satisfied, the loop can indeed execute one time. There is no need for any adjustments to the program state.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
