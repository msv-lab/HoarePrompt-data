According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop can execute again if both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are true. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is between 2 and 26. The variable `len(s)` is at least 2 since `s` has a length of at least 2. Since `j` is less than or equal to `target_len` which is 26, the loop conditions suggest that `i` could be at least 2 and still execute. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to be less than 26, as `j` should not be equal to the upper limit of `target_len` to allow for a potential next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length at least 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is now 2; `j` is now greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26**
