The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `j` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The string `s` continues to consist of lowercase English letters, while `target` is still 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and `target_len` is 26. Therefore, the output state will reflect the incremented value of `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented to 1. If `s[i]` does not match `target[j]`, there is no change to `i` or `j.**
