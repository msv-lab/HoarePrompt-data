The variable `res` initially contains all characters from 'a' to 'z', and `char` is 'a'. The line of code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to `res`. Since `char` is 'a', we are effectively adding 'a' to the existing string `res`, which already contains 'a' through 'z'. 

The existing value of `res` will now contain 'a' one more time, resulting in the string starting with 'aa' followed by the rest of the characters from 'b' to 'z'. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` must include 'a', `res` is 'aaabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char` is 'a'**
