The code `s = s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)` impacts the variable `s`. 

1. The current value of `char` is `'b'`.
2. The `ord(char)` gives the ASCII value of `'b'`, which is `98`.
3. Adding `1` to `98` gives `99`, and `chr(99)` results in the character `'c'`.
4. The `replace` method is called on `s`, replacing the first occurrence of `char` (`'b'`) with `'c'`.
5. Therefore, `s` changes from `'b'` to `'c'`, while `res` and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is 'c', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'**.
