The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. The initial value of `res` is 'ab', and the value of `char` is 'c'. Therefore, the new value of `res` becomes 'abc'. The states of the other variables, `s` and `char`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is 'c', `res` is 'abc', `char` must be 'c'**
