According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `char`. The loop continues executing as long as `char` is in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'c', `res` is 'ab', and `char` is 'b'. Since `char` ('b') is not in `s` ('c'), the loop cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be modified to be a character that is present in `s`. In this case, `s` contains 'c', so for the loop to execute again, `char` must be adjusted to 'c'.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`s` is 'c', `res` is 'ab', `char` must be 'c'**
