According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is found in `s`. Currently, `char` is 'a', and `s` is a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters.

For the loop to execute the first time, the string `s` must contain the character 'a'. Since `res` is an empty string, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the only requirement is that `s` must include 'a'.

State: **`s` must contain the character 'a', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
