The variable `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to its current value. Since `res` starts as an empty string and `char` is 'a', the new value of `res` will be 'a'. The other variables `s` and `char` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` must contain the character 'a'; `res` is 'a'; `char` is 'a'**
