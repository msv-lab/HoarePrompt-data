Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the constant difference `c`. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **When c is 0**: 
   - The sequence remains constant at `a`. Therefore, if `a` equals `b`, the output is "YES", otherwise it is "NO". This covers the case where the sequence does not change, and the logic is correct.

2. **When c is not 0**: 
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to determine if `b` is reachable from `a` via increments of `c`. 
   - It also checks `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that the steps taken to reach `b` are positive, meaning `b` is in the future of the series starting from `a`. This part of the logic ensures we do not count negative steps when going from `a` to `b`.

The program correctly handles the sample inputs provided in the problem description, covering edge cases such as when `c` is 0, and all logical conditions necessary for the problem are satisfied. There are no evident cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements outlined in the description.
