To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements:

### Problem Description Recap:
The sequence starts with an integer `a` and has a common difference `c`. The task is to determine whether another integer `b` appears in this sequence. The sequence can be expressed as:

- `s_1 = a`
- `s_2 = a + c`
- `s_3 = a + 2c`
- ...
- `s_i = a + (i - 1)c`

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`. This can be transformed into the equation:

- `b = a + (i - 1)c` which simplifies to `(b - a) = (i - 1)c`
  
From this, we derive that:
1. If `b == a`, then `b` is in the sequence (output "YES").
2. If `c == 0` and `b != a`, then the sequence is constant (`a, a, a,...`), so "NO".
3. If `c != 0`, check if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`.

### Program Review:
The given program applies these checks:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
1. **Case when `a`, `b`, and `c` are large negative or positive integers:** The range checks should still hold due to Python's handling of integers.
2. **Case when `c` is zero:** The program correctly handles the situation where all sequence elements are equal to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a`, it correctly returns "NO".
3. **Negative `c`:** The program needs to ensure that it correctly identifies when `b` can be reached by moving left in the sequence by a negative step.

### Output Hints Confirmation:
The output hints state that:
- If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO' (if `b` is not `a`).
- If `c` is not zero, it checks divisibility and non-negativity of `(b - a) / c`.

All hints align with the code's implementation.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for all possible cases. It handles edge cases appropriately, including:
- Direct equality check for `a` and `b`.
- The scenario where `c` is zero.
- The general condition for non-zero `c`.

After reviewing both the code and the hints, I find no gaps or incorrect logic.

Correctness: **True**.
