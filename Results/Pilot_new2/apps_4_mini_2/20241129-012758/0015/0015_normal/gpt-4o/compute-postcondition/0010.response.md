The code prints 'NO', which does not change any variable values or affect existing conditions. The precondition remains valid as no variables are altered. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is not equal to 0; the expression ((b - a) % c) is not equal to 0 or ((b - a) / c) is less than 0.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is not equal to 0; the expression ((b - a) % c) is not equal to 0 or ((b - a) / c) is less than 0**.
