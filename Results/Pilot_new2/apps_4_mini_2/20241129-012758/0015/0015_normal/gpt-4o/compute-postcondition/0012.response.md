Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values, with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is 0, the function does not perform any further operation. Otherwise, if `c` is not 0 and the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, then "YES" is printed. If the conditions for printing "YES" are not met, nothing is printed.***
