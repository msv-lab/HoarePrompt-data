The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness against the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Sequence:**
   - The sequence is defined as:
     - \( s_1 = a \)
     - \( s_i = a + (i - 1) \cdot c \) for \( i \geq 1 \)
   - This means that the nth term of the sequence can be expressed as \( s_n = a + (n - 1) \cdot c \).

2. **Conditions for `b` to be in the Sequence:**
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence contains only the value `a`. Therefore, `b` will only appear in the sequence if:
     - \( a = b \) (which should print "YES") or else print "NO".
   - If `c` is not zero, `b` will appear in the sequence if:
     - The difference \( b - a \) is divisible by \( c \) (i.e., \( (b - a) \% c == 0 \)), and 
     - The quotient of this division \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative (i.e., \( (b - a) / c \geq 0 \)), which ensures that \( b \) is reachable in a positive index \( i \).

3. **Verification Against Problem Description:**
   - The program checks both cases of `c`, correctly implementing the necessary conditions to determine if `b` can be expressed in the form of the sequence.
   - For `c = 0`, it correctly checks if `a` is equal to `b`.
   - For `c â‰  0`, it checks the divisibility and the non-negativity of the quotient, ensuring that `b` can be obtained from the sequence.

4. **Examples Verification:**
   - For input `1 7 3`, the sequence is \( 1, 4, 7 \). The output is "YES".
   - For input `10 10 0`, since `a` equals `b`, the output is "YES".
   - For input `1 -4 5`, the sequence is \( 1, 6, 11, ... \), which never reaches `-4`, hence "NO".
   - For input `0 60 50`, the sequence is \( 0, 50, 100, ... \) and never reaches `60`, hence "NO".

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description under all potential cases. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
