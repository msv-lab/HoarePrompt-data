Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the difference `c`. Here’s how it works:

1. **Sequence Definition**: The sequence is defined as:
   - \( s_1 = a \)
   - \( s_i = a + (i - 1) \cdot c \) for \( i \geq 1 \)

2. **Boundary Case for c = 0**:
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence is constant: \( s_i = a \) for all \( i \).
   - The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES", which is correct based on the problem statement. If not, it prints "NO", which is also correct.

3. **General Case for c ≠ 0**:
   - When `c` is not zero, the program verifies if `(b - a) % c == 0` to check if `b` can be reached from `a` by taking steps of size `c`. This checks for divisibility.
   - It then checks if \((b - a) / c \geq 0\) to ensure that `b` can be reached in a positive number of steps, which means `b` must not be less than `a` when `c` is positive or must not be greater than `a` when `c` is negative.

4. **Conclusion**: The combination of these checks ensures that the program correctly determines if `b` appears in the sequence generated by `a` and `c`, fulfilling the requirements set out in the problem description.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described, covering all edge cases and possible values for `a`, `b`, and `c`.
