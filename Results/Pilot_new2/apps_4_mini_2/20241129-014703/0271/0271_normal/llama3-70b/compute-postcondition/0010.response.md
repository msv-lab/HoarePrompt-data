The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is defined to operate without any input arguments. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, and therefore we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given constraints. However, we do know that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, but since `n` is not passed to the function, we cannot infer how it affects the return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not have a specified return value.**
