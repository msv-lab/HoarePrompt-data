To determine the correctness of the given program, we will analyze the problem description, the code, and the output hints step by step.

### Problem description:
Vasya has a non-negative integer \( n \) and he wants to round it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If \( n \) is already a multiple of 10, it is considered rounded. The output should be the nearest multiple of 10. Examples are provided to clarify what the expected behavior is.

### Program:
```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

### Output hints:
The function accepts a non-negative integer \( n \) and prints the nearest multiple of 10. It handles three scenarios:
1. If \( n \) is a multiple of 10, it prints \( n \).
2. If \( n \) is not divisible by 10 and \( n \% 10 \) is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than \( n \).
3. If \( n \% 10 \) is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than \( n \).

### Analysis:
1. **Case when \( n \) is a multiple of 10**: The check `if n % 10 == 0` correctly identifies this case and prints \( n \) as required.
2. **Case when \( n \% 10 \leq 5**: This condition will correctly round down to the nearest 10 (e.g., \( n = 5 \) will print 0, which is valid).
3. **Case when \( n \% 10 > 5**: This condition correctly rounds up to the nearest 10 (e.g., \( n = 6 \) will print 10).

### Edge Cases:
- If \( n = 0\), the program returns 0, which is correct.
- If \( n = 5\), the program can return either 0 or 10. The program will return 10 due to the `else` clause, which is acceptable since both are valid outputs.
- For \( n = 10\), the program correctly returns 10.
- For \( n = 11\), the program will correctly return 10.
- For \( n = 15\), it will return 20, which is what we expect.

The program covers all edge cases and adheres to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description, handling all potential cases as outlined in the examples. The output hints align with the code's functionality. 

Correctness: **True**.
