Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`, resulting in `result` being greater than `n` (ranging from \(n + 1\) to \(n + 4\)).***
