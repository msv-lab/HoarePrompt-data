The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which computes the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer within the range from 0 to \(10^9\), the `remainder` will be an integer between 0 and 9, inclusive. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `remainder` is equal to `n % 10` (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive).**
