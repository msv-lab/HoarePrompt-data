The value of `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Given that `remainder` is `n % 10`, and since it is specified that `remainder` is greater than 5, the possible values of `remainder` are 6, 7, 8, or 9. Therefore, the expression `(10 - remainder)` will yield values from 4 down to 1, respectively. The output state will reflect that `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`, where `remainder` is greater than 5; `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`, where `result` is greater than `n` and can be \(n + 4\) (if remainder is 6) to \(n + 1\) (if remainder is 9).**
