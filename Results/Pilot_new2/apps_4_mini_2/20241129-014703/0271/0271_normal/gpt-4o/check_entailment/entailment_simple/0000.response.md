The provided program is supposed to round a non-negative integer \( n \) to the nearest integer that ends with 0. Let's analyze how the program functions against the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \) from input, which is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Calculation of Rounding**:
   - It calculates the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 10 using `remainder = n % 10`.
   - If the `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest integer that ends with 0 by using `result = n - remainder`.
   - If the `remainder` is greater than 5, it rounds up to the next integer that ends with 0 by using `result = n + (10 - remainder)`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the `result`, which is the rounded integer.

### Analysis of Correctness:
The problem description states that if \( n \) ends with 0, it should remain unchanged. The program correctly handles this case:

- For \( n \) ending in 0 (e.g., \( n = 100 \)), the `remainder` will be 0, and the program will compute:
  - `result = n - remainder = 100 - 0 = 100`, which is correct.

The rounding logic for numbers ending in 1 through 9 is also correct:

- For \( n \) ending in 1 (e.g., \( n = 1 \)):
  - `remainder = 1`, so `result = n - remainder = 1 - 1 = 0`.
- For \( n \) ending in 2 (e.g., \( n = 2 \)):
  - `remainder = 2`, so `result = n - remainder = 2 - 2 = 0`.
- For \( n \) ending in 3 (e.g., \( n = 3 \)):
  - `remainder = 3`, so `result = n - remainder = 3 - 3 = 0`.
- For \( n \) ending in 4 (e.g., \( n = 4 \)):
  - `remainder = 4`, so `result = n - remainder = 4 - 4 = 0`.
- For \( n \) ending in 5 (e.g., \( n = 5 \)):
  - `remainder = 5`, so `result = n - remainder = 5 - 5 = 0`.
- For \( n \) ending in 6 (e.g., \( n = 6 \)):
  - `remainder = 6`, so `result = n + (10 - 6) = n + 4`. This will give a number ending in 0 (e.g., for \( n = 6 \), it gives \( 10 \)).
- For \( n \) ending in 7 (e.g., \( n = 7 \)):
  - This gives \( n + 3 \), resulting in a number ending in 0.
- For \( n \) ending in 8 (e.g., \( n = 8 \)):
  - This gives \( n + 2 \), resulting in a number ending in 0.
- For \( n \) ending in 9 (e.g., \( n = 9 \)):
  - This gives \( n + 1 \), resulting in a number ending in 0.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description and accounts for all cases, including the edge cases. 

Therefore, the program's correctness can be concluded as:

Correctness: **True**
