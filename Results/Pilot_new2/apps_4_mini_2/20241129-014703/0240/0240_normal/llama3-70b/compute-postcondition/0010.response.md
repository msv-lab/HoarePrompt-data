The variable `n` is updated by adding the value of `c`, which is the third character of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `c` is defined and holds a character. The value of `n` will change, but the specific value of `n` remains unspecified in the initial state. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `s`, `n` is updated to `n + c`.**
