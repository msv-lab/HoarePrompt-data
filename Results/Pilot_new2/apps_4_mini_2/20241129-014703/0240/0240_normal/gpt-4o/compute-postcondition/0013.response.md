Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits, `candidate` is a string formed by one of the permutations of `chars` that is a valid number according to `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, and `perm` represents all permutations of `chars`. If there are no valid candidates, the loop does not yield any values.**
