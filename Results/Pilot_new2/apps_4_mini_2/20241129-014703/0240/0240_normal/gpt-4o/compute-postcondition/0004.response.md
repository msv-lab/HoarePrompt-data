Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. If `is_valid_number` returns true for `candidate` and `sub`, then `candidate` is confirmed as a valid number. Otherwise, there is no else condition to evaluate.***
