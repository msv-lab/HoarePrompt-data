To determine whether the provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, we will analyze the functions and their logic.

1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**: 
   - We need to restore an integer `n` from a string `s` that represents a shuffled version of `n` concatenated with the digit count of `n`.
   - The substring `sub` is a known part of `n`.
   - We need to find the smallest possible `n` that satisfies these conditions.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - It calculates `n_len`, which is the length of `n` (i.e., `len(s) - len(sub)`).
     - It uses `Counter` to count occurrences of digits in `s` and `sub`.
     - It subtracts the count of digits in `sub` from `s`.
     - It generates possible numbers using the remaining characters and tries to find the smallest valid number.
  
   - **Function 2 (`is_valid_number`)**:
     - This function checks if the `sub` is contained in `num_str` and if `num_str` has the correct length `n_len`.
     - This check is not complete because `n_len` is not defined within this function, making it reference an external variable erroneously.

   - **Function 3 (`generate_possible_numbers`)**:
     - This function generates permutations of the remaining characters and checks validity against `is_valid_number`.
     - It uses the `permutations` function, which can generate all possible arrangements, potentially leading to inefficiencies for large inputs.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The function `is_valid_number` incorrectly references `n_len`, which is not passed as an argument, leading to potential errors.
   - The program relies on generating all permutations of the remaining characters, which is computationally expensive and unnecessary since we only need to find the smallest valid number.
   - There is no logical guarantee that the function finds the smallest `n` efficiently or correctly, especially with leading zeros.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the issues identified, particularly the reference to `n_len` and the inefficiency of generating all permutations without a clear strategy for minimization, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description accurately.

Therefore, the final determination is:

Correctness: **False**
