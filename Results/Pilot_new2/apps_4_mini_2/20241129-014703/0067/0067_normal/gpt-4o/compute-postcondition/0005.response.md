Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; the current value of `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z < y`).***
