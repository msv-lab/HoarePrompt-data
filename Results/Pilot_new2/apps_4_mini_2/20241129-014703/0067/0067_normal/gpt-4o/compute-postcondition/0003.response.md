The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.**
