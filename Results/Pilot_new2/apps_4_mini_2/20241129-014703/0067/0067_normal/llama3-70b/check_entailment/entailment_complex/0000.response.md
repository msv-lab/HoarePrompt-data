To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. There are three types of voters:
   - `x`: persons who will upvote.
   - `y`: persons who will downvote.
   - `z`: persons whose voting behavior is unknown (can either upvote or downvote).
  
2. We need to determine the outcome based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`:
   - If `x` (upvotes) is greater than `y + z` (downvotes including unknowns), output `"+"`.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, output `"-"`.
   - If `x` is equal to `y`, we need to consider `z`:
     - If `z` is `0`, output `"0"`.
     - If `z` is greater than `0`, output `"?"` (since the result is uncertain).
   - If none of the above conditions apply, output `"?"`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program implements the above logic as follows:
- It reads input values for `x`, `y`, and `z`.
- It checks if `x` is greater than `y + z` and prints `"+"`.
- It checks if `x` is less than `y` and prints `"-"`.
- It checks if `x` is equal to `y`:
  - If `z` is `0`, it prints `"0"`.
  - If `z` is greater than `0`, it prints `"?"`.
- If `x` is neither greater than `y + z` nor less than `y`, and also not equal to `y`, it will print `"?"`.

### Finding Potential Issues:
1. The output logic for `z > 0` which leads to uncertain results is correctly handled.
2. There is no scenario where the program could output an invalid result based on the defined conditions.
3. It covers all edge cases as outlined in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements all the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly distinguishes between the different outcomes based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Therefore, the program is correct under all potential input scenarios defined by the problem.

Correctness: **True**
