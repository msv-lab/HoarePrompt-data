To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and test various scenarios, including edge cases.

### Problem Summary:
1. We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The result will be:
   - "+" if there are more upvotes than downvotes, regardless of unknown votes.
   - "-" if there are more downvotes than upvotes, regardless of unknown votes.
   - "0" if upvotes are equal to downvotes and there are no unknown votes.
   - "?" if there are two possible outcomes due to the presence of unknown votes.

### Program Logic:
The program implements the following logic:
- If `x > y + z`, it prints '+' indicating that even if all unknown votes were downvotes, upvotes would still be greater.
- If `x < y`, it prints '-' indicating that downvotes are definitively more than upvotes.
- If `x == y`, it checks:
  - If `z == 0`, it prints '0' (as there are no unknowns).
  - Otherwise, it prints '?' (since unknown votes could swing the results).
- If none of the above conditions are satisfied, it defaults to printing '?'.

### Testing Cases:
1. **Case (3, 7, 0)**: Expected output is '-' (all known votes).
2. **Case (2, 0, 1)**: Expected output is '+' (unknown vote could only increase upvotes).
3. **Case (1, 1, 0)**: Expected output is '0' (no unknown votes).
4. **Case (0, 0, 1)**: Expected output is '?' (unknown could swing to + or -).
5. **Case (2, 2, 1)**: Unknown vote could lead to '+' or '-', expected output is '?'.
6. **Case (2, 2, 0)**: Expected output is '0' (no unknown votes).

### Evaluation:
- The program will correctly print '+' for cases where upvotes are definitively more, '-' for downvotes, '0' for equal votes without unknowns, and '?' when unknown votes could swing the outcome.
- All scenarios from the problem description and the provided examples are accounted for without omission.
- The only potential edge case that might arise is when both upvotes and downvotes are equal, and `z` is greater than zero, which is correctly handled with a '?'.

After reviewing the logic and checking various edge cases, it appears that the program adheres strictly to the problem specifications.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement, including those where uncertainty arises due to unknown votes.
