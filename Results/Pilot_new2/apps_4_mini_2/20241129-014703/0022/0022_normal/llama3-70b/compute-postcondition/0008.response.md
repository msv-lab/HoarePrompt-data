According to the code, the loop iterates from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which indicates that the loop has executed once and is about to execute for the second time. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1. Hence, for the loop to execute again, `i` will increment to 1.

At this point, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n // 2`. Therefore, we need to maintain the condition that `n` must be greater than 2, which ensures that `n // 2` is greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1**
