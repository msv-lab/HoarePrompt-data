Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; `n` is greater than 4; `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_palindrome` is set to `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
