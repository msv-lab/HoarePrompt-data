The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but we note that `current_counts[colors[left]]` has already been decremented by 1 prior to this operation, and the conditions regarding `current_counts[color]` and `desired_counts[color]` continue to hold true. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `current_counts[colors[left]]` has been decremented by 1, `current_counts[color]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]` for all colors in `desired_counts`, and it is not the case that `current_counts[color]` equals `desired_counts[color]` for all colors in `desired_counts`, and `left` is incremented by 1.**
