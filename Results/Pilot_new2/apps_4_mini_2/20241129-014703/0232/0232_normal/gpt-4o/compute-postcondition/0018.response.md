Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` has been incremented back to at least equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]`. If all values in `current_counts` match their corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the condition has been satisfied.***
