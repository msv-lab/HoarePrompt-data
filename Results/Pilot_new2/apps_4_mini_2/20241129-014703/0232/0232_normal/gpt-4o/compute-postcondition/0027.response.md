Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the number of iterations executed, `current_counts` still indicates that at least one `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]`, `right` is n; `current_counts[colors[right]]` has been increased by 1, and not all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]` for colors in `desired_counts`.***
