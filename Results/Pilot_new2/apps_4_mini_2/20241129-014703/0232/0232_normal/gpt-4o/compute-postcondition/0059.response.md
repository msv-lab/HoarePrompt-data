Output State: **`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` plus the total number of iterations executed; `current_counts` is equal to `desired_counts` for all colors in `desired_counts`; `right` is `n + 1`; there exists no color in `desired_counts` such that `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]`, and the program will return 'YES'.**
