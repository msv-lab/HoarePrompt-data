You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.


-----Example-----
Input
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
1 2

Output
YES
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, m is an integer in the range 1 ≤ m ≤ n, colors is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and k is a list of m integers where the sum of the elements in k is between 1 and n.
def func_1(n, m, colors, k):
    desired_counts = dict(zip(range(1, m + 1), k))
    current_counts = defaultdict(int)
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        current_counts[colors[right]] += 1
        
        while all(current_counts[color] >= desired_counts[color] for color in
            desired_counts):
            if all(current_counts[color] == desired_counts[color] for color in
                desired_counts):
                return 'YES'
            current_counts[colors[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `left` is equal to the initial value of `left` plus the total number of iterations executed; `current_counts` is equal to `desired_counts` for all colors in `desired_counts`; `right` is equal to `n`, and if the loop terminated without returning 'YES', it indicates that there were no colors in `desired_counts` for which `current_counts[color]` was less than `desired_counts[color]` at the end of the loop execution.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that there were no colors in desired_counts for which current_counts[color] was less than desired_counts[color] at the end of the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (the length of the `colors` list), an integer `m` (the number of unique colors), a list `colors` of `n` integers representing color identifiers, and a list `k` of `m` integers representing the desired counts of each color. It checks if any contiguous subarray of `colors` can match the desired counts specified in `k`. If such a subarray exists, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function efficiently tracks the counts of colors in the current window and compares them to the desired counts. Edge cases include scenarios where the `colors` list does not contain enough elements to satisfy the desired counts or where the desired counts themselves cannot be met with the available colors.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
