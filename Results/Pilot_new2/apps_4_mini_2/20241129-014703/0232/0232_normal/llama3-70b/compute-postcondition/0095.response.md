According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration. Since `n` is not defined in the previous state, we only know that `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. 

State: **`found` is true, j is `i + 1`, n must be greater than `i + 1`**
