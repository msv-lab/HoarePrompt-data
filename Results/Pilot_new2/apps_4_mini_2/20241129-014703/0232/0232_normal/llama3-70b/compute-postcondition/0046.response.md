Postcondition: ***`colors` is either empty or contains elements, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1; if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
