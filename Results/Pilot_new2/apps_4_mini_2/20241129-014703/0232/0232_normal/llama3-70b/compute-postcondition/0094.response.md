Postcondition: ***`found` is true. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, and `window_counts[color]` retains its value if `color` is defined, or is unaffected if `color` is undefined.***
