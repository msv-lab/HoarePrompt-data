The operation `color_counts[color] += 1` increments the count of the specified `color` in the `color_counts` dictionary. If `color` was not already in `color_counts`, it would have a value of 0, and thus after this operation, it would be updated to 1. If `color` was already present, its count would simply increase by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `counts`, and `colors` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, `color_counts` contains the key `color` with a value equal to its previous value plus 1, and `colors` is a list that contains at least 1 element.**
