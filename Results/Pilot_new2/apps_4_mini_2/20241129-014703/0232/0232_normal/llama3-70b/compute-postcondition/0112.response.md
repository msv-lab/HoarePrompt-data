Postcondition: ***`found` indicates that the counts in `window_counts` matched the `counts`, `j` is `n - 1`, `window_counts` contains counts of the colors in `colors` from index `i` to `n - 1`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, `window_counts[color]` reflects the counts of the last color processed, where `color` is `colors[n - 1]`, and the value of `found` is true.***
