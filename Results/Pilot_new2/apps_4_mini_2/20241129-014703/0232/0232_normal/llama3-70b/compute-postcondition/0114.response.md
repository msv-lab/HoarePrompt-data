Postcondition: ***`found` indicates whether the counts in `window_counts` matched the `counts`. If `found` is true, it means the counts in `window_counts` match the `counts`, `j` is set to `n - 1`, and the loop is exited. The `window_counts` contains counts of the colors in `colors` from index `i` to `n - 1`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than 2, with `window_counts[color]` reflecting the counts of the last color processed, where `color` is `colors[n - 1]`.***
