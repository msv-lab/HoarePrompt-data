The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` indicates that the counts in `window_counts` matched the `counts`, `j` is `n - 1`, `window_counts` contains counts of the colors in `colors` from index `i` to `n - 1`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2, and `window_counts[color]` reflects the counts of the last color processed, where `color` is `colors[n - 1]`, and the value of `found` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
