The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the function `int` over the result of `input().split()`. The value of `colors` will depend on user input, which is not specified, but it will be a list of integers. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers from user input.**
