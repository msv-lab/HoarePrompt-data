Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, `color_counts` contains the key `color` with a value equal to `0` if `color` was not previously present, and `colors` must contain at least 2 elements for the loop to execute one more time.***
