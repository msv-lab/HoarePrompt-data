Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is greater than 1, `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000) that remains less than all elements of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 1, and if `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, with all other variables retaining their initial conditions.***
