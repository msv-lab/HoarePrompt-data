The variable `b` is assigned a new value based on the output of `input()`, where the input is split into a list of integers. The previous value of `b` is now overridden, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer based on input (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer based on input (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` integers based on input (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers based on input.**
