Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000) that is less than all elements of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0, and `shares` is not greater than 0.***
