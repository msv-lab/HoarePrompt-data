The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 
- `n`: an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30, which represents the number of prices for buying shares.
- `m`: an integer such that 1 <= m <= 30, which represents the number of prices for selling shares.
- `r`: an integer such that 1 <= r <= 1000.
- `s`: a list of `n` integers where each `s[i]` (1 <= s[i] <= 1000) represents the price to buy shares.
- `b`: a list of `m` integers where each `b[i]` (1 <= b[i] <= 1000) represents the price to sell shares.

After executing the function body, the function processes the input parameters to determine certain values based on the buying and selling prices. Since the output details were not explicitly provided in the prompt, we summarize the functionality without detailing the specific return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, a list s of n integers representing buying prices, and a list b of m integers representing selling prices, and processes this data accordingly.**
