The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the ranges (1 <= n <= 30 and n > 1), `m` is an integer within the range (1 <= m <= 30), `i` is the next integer greater than its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
