The code assigns new values to the variables `n`, `m`, and `r` by reading input and mapping it to integers. The initial constraints on `n`, `m`, and `r` (1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000) still hold, but the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `r` will now depend on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `s` is a list of n integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000); `b` is a list of m integers (1 <= b[j] <= 1000)**
