The value of `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`, where `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, and `max_shares` are unaffected except for `remaining_bourles` which now holds the result of that calculation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000); `b` is a list of integers based on input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000); `b` is a list of integers based on input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`.**
