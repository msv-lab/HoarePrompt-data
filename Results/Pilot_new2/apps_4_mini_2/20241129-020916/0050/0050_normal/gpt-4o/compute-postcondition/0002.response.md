The variable `b` is assigned a new value created from a list of integers that is input by the user. The previous state of `b` is now replaced by this new list of integers. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000); `b` is a list of integers based on input.**
