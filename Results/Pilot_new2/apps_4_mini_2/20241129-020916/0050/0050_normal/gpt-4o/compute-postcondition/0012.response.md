Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are integers between 1 and 30 and 1 and 1000 respectively; `s` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000); `b` is a list of integers based on input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the value of `r` is printed. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, which is then printed.***
