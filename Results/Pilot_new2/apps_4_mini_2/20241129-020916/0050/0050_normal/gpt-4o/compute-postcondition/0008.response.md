The variable `max_shares` is assigned the value of `r // min_buy_price`, where `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`. The value of `max_shares` represents the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the available funds `r` based on the minimum buy price. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30; `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000; `s` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000); `b` is a list of integers based on input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`.**
