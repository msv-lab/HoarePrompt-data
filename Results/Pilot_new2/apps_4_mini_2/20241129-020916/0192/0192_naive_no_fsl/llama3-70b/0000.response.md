Correctness: **False**

The given program calculates the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` and prints it. However, this does not correctly represent the minimum number of seconds required to transform the equilateral triangle from side length `x` to side length `y`. 

For example, consider the input case `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The valid transformation sequence is:
1. From (6, 6, 6) to (6, 6, 3)
2. Then to (6, 4, 3)
3. Then to (3, 4, 3)
4. Finally to (3, 3, 3)

This results in a total of 4 operations, but the provided code would output `abs(6 - 3) = 3`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
