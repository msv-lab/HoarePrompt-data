To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze the program and the logic it implements.

### Problem Description Recap:
Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and wants to transform it into an equilateral triangle of side length `y`. He can modify the length of a single side of the triangle in each second while ensuring that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (with positive area). The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds to achieve this transformation.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

1. **Input Reading**: It correctly reads two integers `x` and `y`.
2. **Calculation**: The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` attempts to compute the number of seconds needed to change the triangle from side length `x` to `y`.

### Explanation of the Calculation:
- The difference `x - y` represents how much we need to decrease the side length of the triangle.
- Dividing this difference by 2 (`(x - y) // 2`) gives the number of operations needed if we could decrease both sides simultaneously, but since we can only decrease one side at a time, we need an additional operation for the case where the difference is odd.
- The term `(x - y) % 2` adds an extra second if the difference is odd, which accounts for the last remaining unit that must be removed.

### Validating Against the Problem Description:
The program effectively calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the triangle's side length from `x` to `y` while maintaining the constraints of a non-degenerate triangle. This is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Since the operations performed by the program correctly align with the needs outlined in the problem description, and it accurately computes the number of seconds required for any valid inputs within the specified range, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Thus, the final correctness statement is:

Correctness: **True**
