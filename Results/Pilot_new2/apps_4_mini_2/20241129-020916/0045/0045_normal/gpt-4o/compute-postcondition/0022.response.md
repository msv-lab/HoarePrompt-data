Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; remainder` is decremented by 1; `sequence` is equal to `[d * (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(k - 2)] + [d * k + 1]` where `sequence[k - 2]` is updated to `d * (k - 1) + 1`, and when `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
