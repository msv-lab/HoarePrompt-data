In the provided code snippet, `sequence` is assigned a list comprehension that computes a sequence based on the value of `d` and iterates over a range of `k`. The value of `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, where `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. 

The list comprehension generates `k` elements where each element is `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`. 

Therefore, after the execution:
- The variable `sequence` will contain the computed list based on the values of `d` and `k`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; `remainder` is equal to `n - d * min_sum; `sequence` is equal to `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`.**
