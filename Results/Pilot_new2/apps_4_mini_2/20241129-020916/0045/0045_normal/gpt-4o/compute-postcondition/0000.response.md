The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers, and since `k` can be any positive integer up to 10^10, `min_sum` will be a large positive integer calculated as the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`.**
