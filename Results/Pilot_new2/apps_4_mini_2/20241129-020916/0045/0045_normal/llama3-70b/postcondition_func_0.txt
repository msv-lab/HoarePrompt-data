The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The GCD is computed using the Euclidean algorithm, which continues until `b` becomes 0. The function correctly handles all positive integer inputs within the specified range, ensuring that the result is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
