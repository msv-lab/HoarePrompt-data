The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, where `a` represents the sum `n` and `b` represents the number of elements `k`, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. After executing the function body, it returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is `a`, while `b` is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is `a` when `b` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers, and returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is `a` when `b` is 0.**
