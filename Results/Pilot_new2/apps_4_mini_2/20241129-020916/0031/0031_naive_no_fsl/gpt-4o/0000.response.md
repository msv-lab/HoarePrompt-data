To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and potential edge cases based on the problem description.

The problem is about calculating the probability that at least two out of `k` people share the same birthday, given `2^n` days in a year. The program aims to output the result as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), and it must consider edge cases, particularly when `k` is greater than `2^n` (which guarantees at least one shared birthday).

### Key points to verify:
1. **Input Handling**: 
    - The program handles the case where `k > 2^n` by immediately returning \( A = 1, B = 1 \), which is correct since if there are more people than days, a shared birthday is guaranteed.

2. **Calculating the Probability**:
    - The probability of at least two people sharing a birthday can be calculated using the complement: \( P(\text{no shared}) = \frac{(2^n)(2^n - 1)(2^n - 2)...(2^n - k + 1)}{(2^n)^k} \).
    - The program implements this correctly using a loop to calculate the numerator and the denominator.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
    - The program calculates results modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \), which ensures that the numbers stay manageable and prevents overflow.

4. **GCD Reduction**:
    - It uses the `func_1` function to compute the GCD of \( A \) and \( B \) and reduces them accordingly, which is essential to ensure that the fraction is irreducible.

5. **Output Format**:
    - The program outputs the final values of \( A \) and \( B \) after reduction.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Large Values of `n` and `k`**: Given that `n` can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), the computation of `2^n` directly could lead to issues with handling such large numbers, but the Python integers can handle large values. The program needs to ensure that it doesn't attempt to compute values that exceed memory or computational limits.
  
- **K Equal to 1**: For `k = 1`, the probability that at least two share a birthday should be zero, leading to \( A = 0, B = 1 \), but the problem states that `k` is at least 2, so this case isn't directly relevant for the input constraints.

- **Handling Results Correctly**: The program should ensure the output values adhere to the modulo condition after the GCD reduction, which is handled well.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the logic and potential edge cases, the program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. There are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
