The variable `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The previous state of `denominator` is \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\); `numerator` is \( (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003\); `denominator` is \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003\); `p_no_shared` is equal to the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \**.
