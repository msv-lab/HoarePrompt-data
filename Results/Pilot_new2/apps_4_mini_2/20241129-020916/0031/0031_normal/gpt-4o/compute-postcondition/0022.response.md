To solve this, we will analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)
- `k` is an integer where \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\)
- `MOD` is \(1000003\)
- `total\_days` is equal to \(2^n\)
- `numerator` is \((2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003\)
- `denominator` is \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)
- `p\_no\_shared` is equal to the value of `numerator`
- `p\_total` is \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)
- `p\_shared` is \((p\_total - p\_no\_shared + MOD) \mod MOD\)
- `A` is equal to `p_shared`

### Code Snippet:
```
B = p_total
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
- The state of `p_total` is not altered by this assignment, so it retains its value as \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\).
- Other variables remain unchanged as no other operations are performed.

### Output State:
The value of `B` is now equal to \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\), while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is (2^n) × (2^n - 1) × (2^n - 2) × ... × (2^n - (k - 1)) mod 1000003; `denominator` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_no_shared` is equal to the value of numerator; `p_total` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_shared` is (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) mod MOD; `A` is equal to p_shared; `B` is equal to (2^n)^k mod 1000003.**
