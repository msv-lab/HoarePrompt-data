The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. After executing the function body, it does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and it does not return any output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, where n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), and it returns nothing.**
