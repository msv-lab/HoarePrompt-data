To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial state and the values of the variables involved.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18
- `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18
- `MOD` is 1000003
- `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\)
- `numerator` is \((2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2) \times ... \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003\)
- `denominator` is \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)
- `p_no_shared` is equal to the value of `numerator`
- `p_total` is \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)
- `p_shared` is \((p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) \mod MOD\)
- `A` is equal to `p_shared`
- `B` is equal to \((2^n)^k \mod 1000003\)
- `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`

Now, we need to analyze the execution of the code:
```
A //= g
```
This operation updates the value of `A` by performing an integer floor division of `A` by `g`. 

The specific values of `A` and `g` are dependent on the calculations performed before the division, but we know:
- `A` is initially equal to `p_shared`
- `g` is the result from `func_1(A, B)`, which is not specified in terms of its numerical value.

After executing the operation `A //= g`, `A` will be updated to the integer division of its previous value by `g`.

Thus, the Output State should reflect that the variable `A` has been modified, while all other variables remain unchanged. However, since we don't know the exact values of `A` and `g`, we can only express the output state in a general form.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is (2^n) × (2^n - 1) × (2^n - 2) × ... × (2^n - (k - 1)) mod 1000003; `denominator` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_no_shared` is equal to the value of numerator; `p_total` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_shared` is (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) mod MOD; `A` is updated to A // g; `B` is equal to (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `g` is assigned the value returned by func_1(A, B).**
