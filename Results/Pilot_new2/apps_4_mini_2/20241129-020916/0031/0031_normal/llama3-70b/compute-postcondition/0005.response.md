The `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is `1`, and `total_days` is `2`. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` becomes `1 * 2 = 2`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, `total_days` is equal to `2`, `numerator` is equal to `2`, `denominator` is equal to `2`, `i` is 0**
