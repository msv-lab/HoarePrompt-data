The line of code `numerator *= total_days - i` updates the value of `numerator`. The value of `total_days` is `2`, and the value of `i` is `0`. Therefore, `total_days - i` equals `2 - 0`, which is `2`. 

The previous value of `numerator` is `1`, and after the multiplication, the new value of `numerator` becomes `1 * 2`, which is `2`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, `total_days` is equal to `2`, `numerator` is equal to `2`, `denominator` is equal to `1`, `i` is 0**
