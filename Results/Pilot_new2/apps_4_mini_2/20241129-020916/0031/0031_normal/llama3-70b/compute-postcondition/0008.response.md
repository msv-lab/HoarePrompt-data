The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. Given that `denominator` is initially 2 and `total_days` is also 2, the new value of `denominator` becomes 2 * 2 = 4. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, `i` is 1**
