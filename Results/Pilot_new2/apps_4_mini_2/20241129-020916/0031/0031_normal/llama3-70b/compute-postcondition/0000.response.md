The variable `total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, which calculates `2` raised to the power of `n`. The value of `n` is guaranteed to be between `1` and `10^18`, so `total_days` will be a positive integer that is `2` raised to a power within that range. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, and `total_days` is equal to `2 ** n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, and `total_days` is equal to `2 ** n`.**
