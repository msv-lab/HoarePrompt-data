To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, let's analyze the program's logic step-by-step.

The program reads two very long integers (potentially containing leading zeros) from input, strips their leading zeros, and then compares them:

```python
a = input().lstrip('0')
b = input().lstrip('0')
if a == b:
    print('=')
elif a < b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('>')
```

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Leading Zeros Handling**:
   - The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from the inputs. This is correct because leading zeros should not affect the numerical value. For instance, `00012345` should be treated as `12345`.

2. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program compares the stripped strings directly using Python's inherent string comparison capabilities. This works effectively because:
     - If two strings are equal, it prints `=`.
     - If one stripped string is lexicographically smaller than the other, it prints `<`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `>`. 

3. **Length Comparison**:
   - Python strings compare lexicographically, which means that the comparison works correctly for numerical strings. If two strings have unequal lengths after stripping leading zeros, the longer string represents the larger number.

### Edge Cases:
- When both numbers are `0`, they are equal, and the output should be `=`.
- The program should handle cases where one number is `0` and the other is a non-zero number, returning `<` or `>`.
- The program should correctly handle inputs like `000` and `0`.

### Example Check:
- For input:
  ```
  00012345
  12345
  ```
  The output is `=`, which is correct.
  
- For input:
  ```
  0123
  9
  ```
  The output is `>`, which is correct since `123` > `9`.

- For input:
  ```
  0123
  111
  ```
  The output is `>`, which is incorrect because `123 < 111`. This will lead to the wrong output.

### Conclusion:
The program fails in cases where it compares two numbers that are numerically unequal but the comparison logic is flawed due to string length and lexicographical ordering. 

**Correctness: **False**.**

The logic should first compare the lengths of the stripped numbers before conducting a lexicographical comparison, to ensure accurate results in all edge cases.
