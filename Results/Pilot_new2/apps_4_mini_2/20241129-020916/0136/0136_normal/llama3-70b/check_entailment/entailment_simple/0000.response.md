Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the input strings consist entirely of leading zeroes. When both `a` and `b` are composed solely of leading zeros (e.g., `0000` vs `0000`), the program will strip all leading zeros and compare the resulting empty strings. This will lead to incorrect behavior since it would treat empty strings as equal, which is not the intended behavior of the specification. 

The program should account for the case where both numbers are entirely zeros and ensure that they are handled correctly, outputting `=` in such scenarios. Additionally, if both inputs are empty after stripping, it should also recognize them as equal. 

To fix this, the program could check if the stripped strings are empty and assign them to `"0"` before proceeding with the comparison.
