To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description and output hints, we will analyze the code step by step.

### Problem description:
We need to compare two very large integers, `a` and `b`, represented as strings, and print:
- "<" if `a < b`
- ">" if `a > b`
- "=" if `a == b`
The inputs can have leading zeros and can be up to \(10^6\) digits long.

### Program:
```python
a = input().lstrip('0')
b = input().lstrip('0')
if a == b:
    print('=')
elif a < b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('>')
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both inputs, which is correct since leading zeros do not affect the numerical value.
2. It then compares the modified strings:
   - If they are equal, it prints "=".
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it prints "<".
   - Otherwise, it prints ">".
3. The comparison of strings works correctly because, after removing leading zeros, longer strings represent larger numbers, and for strings of equal length, lexicographical order corresponds to numerical order.

### Edge Cases:
One potential edge case is when both inputs are empty strings. After stripping leading zeros, if both inputs were just zeros or empty, `lstrip('0')` would yield empty strings. The code would then compare these empty strings and print "=", which is not a correct representation since both should be treated as equal.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the program behaves as described for non-negative integers. However, they also mention that:
- If both inputs are empty or contain only zeros, they will be treated as equal.
- The function does not handle cases where both inputs are empty strings leading to an output of "=".

This matches our initial observation and highlights a potential flaw in the code when both inputs are empty or consist solely of zeros.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle the edge case where both inputs are empty, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The code fails when both inputs are empty or consist solely of zeros, leading to an incorrect output of "=" instead of the expected behavior. For example, if both inputs are empty, the output should not be "=" since it does not represent any valid integer comparison.
