The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings, `a` and `b`, which may contain leading zeroes, and compares them. It outputs '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. If either `a` or `b` is an empty string after stripping leading zeroes, it is treated as '0'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result.
