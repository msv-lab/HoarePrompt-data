The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state indicates that `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, which means that after removing leading zeroes, `b` could potentially be an empty string if `data[1]` was "0" or had leading zeroes only.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after leading zeroes have been stripped from `data[1]`; `data` is a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and `b` may now be an empty string if `data[1]` was "0" or only contained leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after leading zeroes are stripped from `data[1]`; `data` is a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace.**
