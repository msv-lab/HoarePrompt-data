Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, and if `a` is '0', then `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after leading zeroes are stripped from `data[1]`. `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace. The current value of `b` is an empty string.***
