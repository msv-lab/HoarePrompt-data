Correctness: **False**

The provided program simply counts the number of employees belonging to the two fractions (depublicans and remocrats) and declares the winner based solely on which fraction has more members. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the voting process described in the problem statement.

According to the problem description, employees deny each other the right to vote in a structured manner that depends on the order of their statements and the strategy that they would employ. It is possible for a smaller group to win by strategically denying the right to vote to members of the opposing fraction.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
DRRRD
```

Here, according to the optimal strategy:
1. The first employee ('D') could deny the last employee ('D') or any of the 'R' employees.
2. If the first employee denies one of the 'R' employees, then there are still more 'R' employees left who could continue denying the rest of the 'D' employees.
3. Ultimately, the 'R' employees could end up winning even if there are two 'D' employees.

In this case, the program would output 'R' (correctly), but if a single 'D' denies only one 'R', the count logic fails because it does not consider the sequence of denials. The logic ignores that a group can strategically eliminate the opposition.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not account for the required strategic behavior of employees in the voting process. It only checks the counts without considering the implications of the voting logic described.
