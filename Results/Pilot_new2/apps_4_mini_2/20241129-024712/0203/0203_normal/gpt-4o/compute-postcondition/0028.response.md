The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from the `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. The `d_queue` must contain at least one index, so after the operation, `d_queue` will have one less element. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains one less index; `r_queue` must contain at least one index; `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`.**
