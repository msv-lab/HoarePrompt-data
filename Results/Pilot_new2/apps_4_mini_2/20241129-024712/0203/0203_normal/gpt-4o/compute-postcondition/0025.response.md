The operation appends the value `r_index + n` to the `r_queue`. Given that `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, the new value appended to `r_queue` will be strictly greater than `r_index` (since `n` is positive). The values of `n`, `votes`, `d_queue`, `d_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains at least one index; `r_queue` now contains an additional index equal to `r_index + n`; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue` before the pop operation; `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop; and `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.**
