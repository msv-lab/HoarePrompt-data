`d_queue` is modified by appending the value of `d_index + n` to it. The variable `d_index` holds the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, the value appended to `d_queue` will also be positive and greater than `d_index`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` now contains the value `d_index + n` appended; `r_queue` contains one less index; `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`; `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`.**
