The code appends the result of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200000, and `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed, the new element added to `r_queue` will be `r_index + n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains the elements after removing the first element; `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue` before it was removed; `r_queue` now contains an additional element equal to `r_index + n`; `r_queue` is one element shorter; `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed.**
