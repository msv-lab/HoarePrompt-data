The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes an input string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The output state reflects that `votes` now holds the input string after stripping any whitespace.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is the input string stripped of whitespace.**
