The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation is executed. After executing the `pop(0)` method, the first element is removed from `r_queue`, but the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains at least one index; `r_queue` contains one less index; `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue` before the pop operation; `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop.**
