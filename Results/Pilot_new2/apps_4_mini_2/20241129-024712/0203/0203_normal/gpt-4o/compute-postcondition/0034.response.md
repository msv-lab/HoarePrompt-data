The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes and returns the first element from `d_queue`, which changes the state of `d_queue`. The value of `d_index` will be equal to the element that was at index 0 of `d_queue` prior to the operation. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains the elements after removing the first element, `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue` before it was removed; `r_queue` must contain at least one index.**
