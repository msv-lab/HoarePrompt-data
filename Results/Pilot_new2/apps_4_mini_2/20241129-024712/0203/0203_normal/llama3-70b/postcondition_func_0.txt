The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats). It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string and prints 'D' if depublicans outnumber remocrats; otherwise, it prints 'R'. Note that if both counts are equal, it will still print 'R', which may not be clearly stated in the annotations.
