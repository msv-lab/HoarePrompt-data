`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The string of length `n` is not affected by this line of code, and its value remains undefined until explicitly assigned. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now a positive integer based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; the string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' is yet to be defined.**
