The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` was 0, so after the increment, the new value of `depublicans` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string of 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, and the current value of `fraction` is 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string of 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, and the current value of `fraction` is 'D'.**
