The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state remains the same for those variables. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element in `assigned`; `can_form` is True**
