The code snippet `assigned.add(a[i])` adds the element `a[i]` to the set `assigned`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected either.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is at least 3, `assigned` contains elements, and `a[i]` has been added to the set `assigned`.**
