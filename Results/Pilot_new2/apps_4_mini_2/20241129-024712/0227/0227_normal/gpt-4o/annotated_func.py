#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and a is a list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        
        if not can_form:
            m += 1
        
        assigned.add(a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `assigned` contains all elements of `a`, `m` is the count of elements in `a` that could not be formed from differences of previously assigned integers, and `i` is equal to `n`.
    return m
    #The program returns the count 'm' of elements in 'a' that could not be formed from differences of previously assigned integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts and returns the number of elements in `a` that cannot be formed as differences of previously assigned integers from the sorted list. Elements that can be formed from such differences will not contribute to the count. The function ensures that all integers in `a` are considered, and the count reflects only those that are not representable as differences of any two previously assigned integers.
