To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the sequence of operations as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We have a distinct positive integer sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2. We begin with `m` variables initialized to zero.
3. The first operation assigns `a_1` to some variable `b_x`.
4. For subsequent operations, we assign `a_t` to `b_y` as the sum of two existing variables `b_i` and `b_j`.
5. The goal is to find the minimum number of variables `m` such that we can perform all operations without any failure.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads `n` and a list `a` of integers. It sorts `a`.
2. It initializes `m` to 1.
3. It iterates through the sorted list, incrementing `m` each time an element is not double the previous element (`a[i] != a[i-1] * 2`).
4. Finally, it prints `m` if `m` is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.

### Correctness Check:
- The program assumes that the only way to build the `a` sequence using additions is if each element can be represented as a sum of previous variables.
- It checks if each subsequent number is double the previous one, which is a restrictive condition and does not account for all possible combinations of sums that can form the required values in `a`.
- There are valid cases (as shown in the example with `3 6 5`) where operations cannot be performed as per the requirement, but the program may not return `-1` appropriately.

#### Example Verification:
1. For the input `3 6 5`, the correct logic should determine that it's impossible to form `5` and `6` from `3` using the rules given. The program would incorrectly return `m = 3`, which is not valid.
2. For `1 2 3 6 8`, the program correctly identifies that `2` variables are needed. However, for the sequence to work as described, it is not enough to check only if elements are double, as multiple combinations must be explored.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to cover all necessary conditions to fulfill the problem statement comprehensively. It relies only on the doubling condition and may produce incorrect results for various input sequences.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
