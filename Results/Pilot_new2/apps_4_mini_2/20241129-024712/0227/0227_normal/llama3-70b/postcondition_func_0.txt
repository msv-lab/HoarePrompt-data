The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the count of distinct positive integers and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list `a` are not double the previous element and returns this count if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it returns -1. If `n` is 1, the function will always return 1 since there are no previous elements to compare.
