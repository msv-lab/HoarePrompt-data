The `seen_remainders` set is updated by adding the value of `remainder` to it. The initial state mentions that if `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No', meaning `remainder` is not currently in `seen_remainders` when this line executes. Therefore, the addition of `remainder` to `seen_remainders` does not affect the other variables, and the information regarding `n` and `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range specified, `seen_remainders` now includes `remainder`.**
