To determine the correctness of the annotated program against the given problem description, we need to analyze the program step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are tasked with determining if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. This means that for any integers `i` and `j` (where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`), the condition `n % i` should not equal `n % j`.

2. **Input and Output**: The program takes two integers `n` and `k` as input and should output "Yes" if all remainders are distinct and "No" otherwise.

3. **Reviewing the Code**:
   - The program reads the integers `n` and `k` and initializes an empty set `seen` to track unique remainders.
   - It uses a for loop to iterate over all integers from `1` to `k`.
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the remainder `n % i`.
   - If this remainder is already in the `seen` set, it prints "No" and exits the program.
   - If the remainder is not in the set, it adds the remainder to `seen`.
   - After the loop finishes without finding any duplicates, it prints "Yes".

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly calculates remainders for all integers from `1` to `k`.
   - It efficiently checks for duplicates using a set, which provides average O(1) time complexity for insert and lookup operations.
   - The output aligns with the requirements of the problem description, where it outputs "Yes" if all remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `k = 1`, the remainder `n % 1` is always `0`, which means it will output "No" as expected.
   - For any `k >= n`, remainders will repeat (e.g., `n % n` is `0`), which will also be correctly identified by the program.
   - The program handles the maximum constraints (`n, k ≤ 10^18`) without performance issues, as Python’s integers can handle very large numbers.

Based on the analysis above, the program fulfills the requirements set by the problem description correctly in all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
