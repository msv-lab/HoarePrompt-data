Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. 

### Explanation:

1. **Handling of Remainders:**
   - The function calculates the remainders of `n` when divided by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` using the expression `remainder = n % i`.
   - However, when `i` is greater than `n`, the remainder will be equal to `n` (i.e., for all `i > n`, `n % i` will be `n`). This means for `k >= n + 1`, the function will have duplicate remainders (specifically, `n` will appear multiple times).

2. **Distinctness Condition:**
   - The requirement is to determine whether all remainders are distinct for `1 ≤ i ≤ k`. The program correctly checks if any remainder has already been seen by using a set, but it fails to account for cases where `k` exceeds `n` and hence causes duplicates.

3. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - For instance, if `n = 5` and `k = 6`, the remainders would be `{5 % 1, 5 % 2, 5 % 3, 5 % 4, 5 % 5, 5 % 6}` which leads to the set `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, all distinct. However, if `k` were to be `7`, the remainders would include `5` again, leading to the output "No" but the program would incorrectly return "Yes" in some cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for the distinctness of remainders when `k` exceeds `n`. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect according to the problem description.
