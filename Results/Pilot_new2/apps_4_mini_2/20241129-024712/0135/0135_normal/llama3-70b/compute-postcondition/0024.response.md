The function `func` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input, where both integers are guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^{18}\). It then calculates the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. The function keeps track of these remainders in a set called `seen`. If a remainder is found in the `seen` set (indicating that it has already been computed for a previous value of `i`), the function outputs "No" and terminates immediately. If all remainders are unique after checking all values from 1 to `k`, it outputs "Yes". 

Note that the function does not directly accept parameters and relies on user input for `n` and `k`. Additionally, there are no explicit return statements; instead, output is handled via print statements.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` via user input, checks if the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k` are unique, and prints "No" if any remainder is repeated, or "Yes" if all remainders are unique. **
