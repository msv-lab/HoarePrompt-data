The code `exit()` is called, which causes the program to terminate immediately. Therefore, no variables are modified, and the program does not proceed to any further instructions or calculations. The current state of the program is preserved as it was just before the exit call.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is 0, and 'No' has been printed to the console.**
