The code `exit()` is invoked, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, the variables retain their current values, and no changes are made to them. The program will not continue, and thus the execution context is left unchanged apart from the program's termination.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing 0 and possibly 1, `remainder` is equal to `n % 3, and the program has exited.**
