The code contains a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. None of the variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `seen`, `remainder`) are modified or assigned new values by this statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `seen` is a set containing 0, `remainder` is equal to `n % 2`, and 'No' has been printed.**
