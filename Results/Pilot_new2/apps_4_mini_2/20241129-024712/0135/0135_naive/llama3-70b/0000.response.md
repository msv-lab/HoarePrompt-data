To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and potential edge cases.

The program checks for distinct remainders of the division of `n` by all integers from `1` to `k`. It does this by iterating through the range from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` modulo `i`, and storing these in a set to check for duplicates.

However, there is an important edge case to consider:

1. When `k` is greater than `n`, the values for `i` will exceed `n`, meaning that the remainders could still be `n % i` for values of `i` from `n+1` to `k`, which will always yield `n` (since for any `i > n`, `n % i = n`). Therefore, if `k` is greater than `n`, the remainders will not be distinct, as `n % (n + 1)` will equal `n` and will also equal `n % n`.

Thus, the program fails to account for this case, which means it will return "Yes" incorrectly when `k > n`.

For example:
- If we take `n = 5` and `k = 6`, the remainders would be: 
  - `5 % 1 = 0`
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 3 = 2`
  - `5 % 4 = 1`
  - `5 % 5 = 0`
  - `5 % 6 = 5`
  
  In this case, we have duplicate remainders (0 and 1), and thus the expected output should be "No".

Since the program does not handle the case where `k > n`, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
