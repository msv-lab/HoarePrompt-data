The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here are the details for each parameter:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.

After executing the function body, the function returns `total_time`, which is calculated using the parameters `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return a calculated `total_time` based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers), a, and b (distinct integers), and returns total_time calculated based on time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.**
