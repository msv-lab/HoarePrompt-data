The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the corresponding `block` and `floor` within a structure where each block contains `m` floors and each floor contains `k` apartments. The function returns the values of `block` and `floor` based on the provided apartment number, assuming that the apartment number is valid within the given structure. If `apartment` is outside the valid range (1 to `n*m*k`), the behavior is undefined as no error handling is implemented.
