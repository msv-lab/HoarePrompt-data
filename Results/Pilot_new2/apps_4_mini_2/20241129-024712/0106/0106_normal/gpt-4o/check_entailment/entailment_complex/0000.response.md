To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze its behavior in relation to the problem description and the code annotations.

### Problem Description Recap
The problem describes a building with:
- `n` entrances (blocks)
- `m` floors per block
- `k` apartments per floor
Apartments are numbered in a sequential manner across blocks and floors. Edward lives in apartment `a`, and Natasha lives in apartment `b`. The goal is to compute the minimum time it takes for Edward to reach Natasha, considering the following:
1. Going up or down one floor takes 5 seconds.
2. Moving between adjacent blocks takes 15 seconds.
3. The elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor movement.
4. Edward can only exit from the first floor of his block.

### Function Analysis
1. **`get_location(apartment)`**: 
   - It calculates the block and floor of the given apartment. It assumes that the apartment number is valid and within the defined range.
   - It correctly divides apartments into blocks and floors based on the formula provided.

2. **`func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - It computes the time taken for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on various time calculations:
     - `time_to_exit`: Time taken to exit from Edward's current floor (using the elevator if not on the first floor).
     - `min_walk_time`: Minimum walking time between the blocks in both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise).
     - `time_to_target_floor`: Time taken to reach Natasha's floor once Edward is in her block.

### Points of Concern
- **Handling of Invalid Apartment Numbers**: The `get_location` function does not handle cases where the apartment number is outside the valid range. If `a` or `b` are invalid, this would lead to undefined behavior.
- **Elevator Logic**: The elevator logic seems to be implemented but not fully explored in cases where it might be beneficial to use the elevator to reach the first floor, especially when Edward is on a higher floor.
- **Time Calculation for Different Scenarios**: There might be scenarios where walking to another block is slower than taking the elevator down first before walking, especially if the destination block is far.

### Example to Illustrate Potential Issue
Consider the following scenario:
- `n = 3, m = 1, k = 5`
- `a = 1` (Block 1, Floor 1) and `b = 6` (Block 2, Floor 1).

In this case, the program will calculate `time_to_exit` as 0 (since Edward is already on the first floor), and the time to walk to block 2 would be calculated as `15 seconds`. The expected output would be `15 seconds`.

However, if `a` were any apartment on a higher floor, say `a = 2` (Block 1, Floor 1, Apartment 2), then the elevator should be called to go down to the first floor before walking to Block 2, which could lead to a lower total time than directly walking.

### Conclusion
The program does not account for the best strategy in navigating through the building, especially when considering the elevator usage. Furthermore, it assumes valid apartment numbers without handling potential invalid input.

Given these points, the code does not follow the problem description correctly, particularly regarding edge cases and optimal time calculations.

Correctness: **False**
