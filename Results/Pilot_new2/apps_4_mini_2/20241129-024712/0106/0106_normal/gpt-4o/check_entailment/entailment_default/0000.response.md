Upon examining the problem description, the program aims to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on a circular building layout with specific movement times. The function `func_1` uses the helper function `get_location` to determine the block and floor of the given apartment numbers.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Methodology**: The program correctly identifies Edward's and Natasha's locations using the `get_location` function. It calculates:
   - The time taken to exit from Edward's apartment to the first floor.
   - The walking time between the blocks in a circular manner considering both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions.
   - The time taken to ascend to Natasha's floor after reaching her block.

2. **Edge Cases**: The main edge cases to consider include:
   - Edward being on the first floor of his block.
   - Natasha being on the first floor of her block.
   - The scenario where the two apartments are in adjacent blocks.

### Review of Output Hints:
The output description for function 1 states that it returns the total time based on the exit time, minimum walking time, and time to reach the target floor. Function 2 correctly calculates the block and floor based on the apartment number. However, the output description for function 2 notes that if the apartment number is invalid, the behavior is undefined due to lack of error handling.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Invalid Apartment Numbers**: The program does not handle the case where the given apartment numbers `a` or `b` are outside the valid range (1 to `n * m * k`). If the input is invalid, this could lead to incorrect calculations or runtime errors.
2. **Circular Walking Time Calculation**: The calculation for the `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` seems to be correct based on the given problem. However, if the apartments are in adjacent blocks, it would be more efficient to calculate this distance directly as 15 seconds without the modulo operation.
3. **Timing Calculation**: The time taken to exit from the first floor is calculated correctly, but edge cases where both apartments are on the first floor may lead to an unnecessary calculation.

### Conclusion:
While the provided code generally adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description, the lack of error handling for invalid apartment numbers and potential timing miscalculations for edge cases indicate that the program does not handle every potential case correctly.

Correctness: **False**. The program does not adequately handle invalid apartment numbers, which could lead to incorrect results.
