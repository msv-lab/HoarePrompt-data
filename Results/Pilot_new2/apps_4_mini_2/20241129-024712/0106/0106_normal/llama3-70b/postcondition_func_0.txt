The function accepts user inputs for integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (with constraints 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000), and integers `a` and `b` (with constraints 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b). It calculates the minimum time required to move between two specified blocks in a grid structure, taking into account both block and floor transitions, and prints the total time. The function does not return any values; it only prints the result.
