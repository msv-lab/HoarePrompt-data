The variable `count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `count` is 2, after the increment, `count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 3**
