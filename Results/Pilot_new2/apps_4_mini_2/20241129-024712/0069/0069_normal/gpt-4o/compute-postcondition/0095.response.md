Postcondition: ***`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is at least 0, `index` must be valid (previous value + 3), `s` is data[index + 2] and must be valid, `x` is data[index + 1] and must be valid, `balance` is calculated from `s`, `prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, where `prefix_balances[n]` reflects the final balance after processing up to `n` characters of `s. The value of `balance` is not equal to 0.***
