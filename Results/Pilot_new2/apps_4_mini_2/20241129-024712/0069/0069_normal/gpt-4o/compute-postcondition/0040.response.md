According to the code, the loop iterates `T` times. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is between 1 and 100. This means that the loop has executed `T - 1` times so far. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` (the loop variable) would be incremented by 1, which means it would reflect the next iteration.

Since the loop index variable `_` does not affect anything outside the loop and is generally used in place of a traditional loop variable when the value is not needed, it does not change any other states. However, the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `T`.

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100**
