The variable `data` is assigned the value of the result from `input().split()`, which takes the entire input string and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `T`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The exact contents of `data` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `data` is a list of strings created from the input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `x` is an integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings from the input.**
