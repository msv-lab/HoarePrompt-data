Output State: **`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` must be greater than 0, `index` must be valid (previous value + 3), `s` is data[index + 2] and must be valid, `x` is data[index + 1] and must be valid, `balance` is calculated from `s` and not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` must contain at least two elements, if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is set to the previous value of `count + 1`.**
