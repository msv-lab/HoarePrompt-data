The variable `s` is assigned the value `data[index + 2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as none of them are modified by this code. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged conditions for `T`, `n`, and `x`, along with the new assignment for `s`. 

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100; `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`; `x` is an integer equal to `int(data[index + 1])`; `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]**.
