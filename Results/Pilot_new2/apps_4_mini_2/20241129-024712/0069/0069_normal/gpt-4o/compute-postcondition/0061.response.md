The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 1, `index` is at least 3, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`, the value of `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0.
