Postcondition: ***`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is at least 0, `index` is valid (previous value + 3), `s` is `data[index + 2]` and is valid, `x` is `data[index + 1]` and is valid, and `balance` is calculated from `s`. If the current value of `balance` is 0 and `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, then `-1` has been appended to `results`. If `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` now includes an additional value of 0. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of valid `b` values in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now contains an additional value equal to `count`.***
