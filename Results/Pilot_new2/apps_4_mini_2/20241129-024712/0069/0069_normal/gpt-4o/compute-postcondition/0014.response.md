According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[1]` is equal to `prefix_balances[0]` plus (1 if `s[0]` is '0' else -1).**
