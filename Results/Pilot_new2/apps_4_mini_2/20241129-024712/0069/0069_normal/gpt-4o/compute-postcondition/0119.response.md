Functionality: ** The function reads input values for multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s`. It calculates the balance of zeros and ones in `s`, and based on this balance and the value of `x`, it determines how many valid balances can be achieved. If the balance is zero and `x` exists in the calculated prefix balances, it appends -1 to the results; otherwise, it appends 0. If the balance is non-zero, it counts how many prefix balances satisfy the condition that `(x - balance) % balance == 0` and are non-negative. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases. The function does not accept parameters directly but processes input from the standard input. **
