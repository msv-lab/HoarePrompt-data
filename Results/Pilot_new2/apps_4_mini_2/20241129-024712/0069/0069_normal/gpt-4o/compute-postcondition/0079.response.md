The variable `index` is incremented by 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `index` has increased, while all other variables retain their previous conditions.

Output State: **`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `index` is equal to its previous value plus 3, `s` is now equal to `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`.**
