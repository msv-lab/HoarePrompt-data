The line of code updates the `prefix_balances` list at index `i` based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. Here, `prefix_balances[i]` will be assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus either `1` (if `s[i - 1]` is `'0'`) or `-1` (if `s[i - 1]` is `'1'`). The preconditions note that `s` and `prefix_balances` are valid and that `i` must be greater than or equal to `1` for this operation to be valid.

Given that the exact previous values of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and `s[i - 1]` are not specified, the output state will reflect the changes to `prefix_balances[i]` based on those conditions.

Output State: **`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` must be at least 1, `index` must be valid (previous value + 3), `s` is data[index + 2] and must be valid, `x` is data[index + 1] and must be valid, `balance` is calculated from `s`, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**.
