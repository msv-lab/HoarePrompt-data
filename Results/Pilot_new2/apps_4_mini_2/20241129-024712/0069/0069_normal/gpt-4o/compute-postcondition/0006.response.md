The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list of strings, and `index` is currently 1. Since `data` contains strings from input, `n` will now hold the integer conversion of the string located at `data[1]`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the conditions of `T`, `x`, `data`, and `results` while updating `n`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
