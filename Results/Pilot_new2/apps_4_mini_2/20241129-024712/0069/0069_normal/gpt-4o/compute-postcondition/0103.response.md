Postcondition: ***`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is greater than 0, `index` is valid (previous value + 3), `s` is `data[index + 2]` and valid, `x` is `data[index + 1]` and valid, `balance` is calculated from `s` and is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` contains at least two elements. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `count` remains unchanged.***
