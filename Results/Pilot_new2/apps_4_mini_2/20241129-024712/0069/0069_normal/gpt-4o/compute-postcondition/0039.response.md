Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the sum of the counts of '0's minus the counts of '1's in the first `i` characters of `s`. If `balance` is 0, if `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1 appended to it; otherwise, it includes an additional element `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the total number of valid `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` includes the value of `count`.***
