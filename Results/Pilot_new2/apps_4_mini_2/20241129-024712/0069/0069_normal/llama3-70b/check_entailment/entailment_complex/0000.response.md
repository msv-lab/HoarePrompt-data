Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s` are equal (`cnt0 == cnt1`). When this occurs, the balance is zero, and if `x` is not equal to the balance, the program will attempt to calculate `(x - balance) / (cnt0 - cnt1)`, which results in a division by zero. This is a critical flaw because it means the program can crash or produce incorrect behavior in cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `x` differs from the balance.

For example, if the input string is `s = "01"` (where `cnt0 = 1` and `cnt1 = 1`), and the desired balance `x` is set to any value different from `0`, the program will fail when trying to execute `(x - balance) / (cnt0 - cnt1)` due to division by zero.

Moreover, the logic for determining the number of valid prefixes based on the balance is not entirely accurate when `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `x` is not in line with the possible balances of the infinite string `t`. The program does not account for the resulting infinite possibilities in certain conditions, leading to incorrect results.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, particularly for the case mentioned.
