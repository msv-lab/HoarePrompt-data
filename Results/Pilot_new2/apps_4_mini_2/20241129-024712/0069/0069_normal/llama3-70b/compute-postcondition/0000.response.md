Output State: **`T` is the number of test cases, which is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100) representing the number of test cases, and `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The values of `n` (a positive integer for each test case) and `x` (an integer for each test case) remain unaffected as they are not yet defined or assigned.**
