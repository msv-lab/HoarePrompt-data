Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `n` (the length of a binary string `s`), an integer `x` (the desired balance), and a binary string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It calculates the balance as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`. The function prints `n + 1` if the balance equals `x`. If the balance does not equal `x` and the difference `x - balance` is divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1` (where `cnt0` is the count of '0's and `cnt1` is the count of '1's), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The function does not handle cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `x` differs from `balance`, which could lead to division by zero.**
