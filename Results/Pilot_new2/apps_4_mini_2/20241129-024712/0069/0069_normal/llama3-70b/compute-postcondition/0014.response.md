Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `_` is the current iteration (starting from 0), `n` is an input integer, `x` is another input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, then `n + 1` has been printed. Otherwise, if `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, then -1 is printed; otherwise, the printed result is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
