Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the number of prefixes of the infinite string \( t \) that have a balance equal to \( x \). The key steps and considerations are as follows:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program calculates the balance of the string \( s \) by counting the number of '0's and '1's, which is essential for determining how the prefixes of \( t \) behave.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: It constructs a list of prefix balances for all prefixes of the string \( s \). This allows the program to examine how the balance changes as we include more characters from \( s \).

3. **Handling Infinite Cases**: If the overall balance of \( s \) is zero and \( x \) is present in the list of prefix balances, the program correctly identifies that there are infinitely many prefixes with balance \( x \) (since repeating \( s \) does not change the balance).

4. **Finite Counting**: For cases where the overall balance is not zero, the program checks each prefix balance to see how many times it can reach the desired balance \( x \) in the context of repetitions of \( s \).

The implementation adheres to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description, properly handling edge cases such as:
- When \( n = 1 \) or the string consists entirely of '0's or '1's.
- Properly checking modular conditions to ensure valid counts of prefixes.

Overall, the logic covers all required functionalities, and I could not identify any cases where it would fail based on the problem description.
