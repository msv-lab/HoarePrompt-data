The code defines a lambda function `rint` which reads an integer from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer. This function does not read any input itself but prepares a way to read integers from the standard input later. The initial state remains unchanged except that now there is a new function `rint` available.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); the input consists of \(n-1\) lines, each containing two integers representing the edges of the tree; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings; `rint` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer.**
