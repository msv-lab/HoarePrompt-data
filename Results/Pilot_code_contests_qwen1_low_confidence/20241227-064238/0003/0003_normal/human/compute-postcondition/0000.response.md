The given lambda function `rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()` does not affect the values of the variables directly but rather sets up a function that reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. Since no actual input is read in this snippet, the only change is the definition of the `rstr` function.

The initial state is that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and there are \(n-1\) lines of input, each containing two integers representing the edges of a tree, where each node (except for two) has a degree of at least 1.

After defining the `rstr` function, the values of `n` and the structure of the input data remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); the input consists of \(n-1\) lines, each containing two integers representing the edges of the tree; each node (except for two) has a degree of at least 1, and the `rstr` function is defined as `lambda : stdin.readline().strip()`**
