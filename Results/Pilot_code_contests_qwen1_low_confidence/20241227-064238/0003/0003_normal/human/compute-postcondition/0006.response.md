The code defines a lambda function `rints_2d` that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers, each obtained by calling `rints()`. This means that `rints_2d` will read `n` integers from standard input and store them in a list. However, since no integers have been read yet when this lambda function is defined, it will simply define the function without changing any existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings; `rints` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` strings read from standard input; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input.**
