The provided code defines a lambda function `rints` that reads multiple integers from standard input. Specifically, it reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each string to an integer, returning a list of these integers.

Since the initial state of `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `rints` is defined without being called, no variables are actually modified by this code snippet. The lambda function `rints` is merely defined but not invoked, so the values of `n` and `rstrs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings; `rints` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer.**
