The provided code defines a lambda function `pr` which writes a list of arguments joined by a specified separator to standard output followed by a newline. However, this function does not assign any values to existing variables or create new variables. It simply formats and outputs data.

Since no variables are assigned or modified within the given code snippet, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings; `rints` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` strings read from standard input; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input.**
