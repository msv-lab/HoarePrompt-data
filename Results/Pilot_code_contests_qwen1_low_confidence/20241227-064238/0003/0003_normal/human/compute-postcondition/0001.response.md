The given code does not perform any operations on the variables or modify their values. It only defines a lambda function `rstrs`. This function reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings. The initial values of `n` and the edges of the tree remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); the input consists of \(n-1\) lines, each containing two integers representing the edges of the tree; `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings.**
