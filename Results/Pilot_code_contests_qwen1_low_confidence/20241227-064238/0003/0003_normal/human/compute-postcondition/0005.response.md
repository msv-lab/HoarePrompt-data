The code defines a lambda function `rint_2d` which takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers, each obtained by reading an integer from standard input using the `rint` lambda function.

- `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `rstrs`, `rints`, and `rstr_2d` remain unchanged.
- `rint_2d` is now defined as a lambda function that generates a list of `n` integers by reading from standard input.

Since no specific input is provided, the lambda function `rint_2d` is now ready to be used to read and process integers. However, its execution depends on the input provided at runtime.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings; `rints` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` strings read from standard input; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input.**
