The code initializes an empty list `out`. No changes are made to the values of `n`, `rstrs`, `rints`, `rstr_2d`, `rint_2d`, or `rints_2d`. Therefore, the only affected variable is `out`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings; `rints` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` strings read from standard input; `rint_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input; `rints_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` integers read from standard input; `out` is an empty list.**
