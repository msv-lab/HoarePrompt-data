The code defines a lambda function `rstr_2d` which takes an integer `n` and returns a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a string read from standard input using the `rstr()` function.

In the initial state, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings. `rints` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer.

After executing the code, the value of `n` remains unchanged, but the variable `rstr_2d` is now assigned a lambda function that generates a list of `n` strings when called. The other variables (`rstrs` and `rints`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual strings, and returns them as a list of strings; `rints` is a lambda function that reads an integer from standard input using `stdin.readline()` and converts it to an integer; `rstr_2d` is a lambda function that takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` strings read from standard input.**
