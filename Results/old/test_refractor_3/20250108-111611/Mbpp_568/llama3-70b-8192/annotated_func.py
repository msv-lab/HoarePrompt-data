#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return [{} for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing {} repeated n times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as a parameter and returns a list containing `n` empty dictionaries (`{}`). The function creates a list of length `n`, where each element is an empty dictionary. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations. The final state of the program after the function concludes is a list of `n` empty dictionaries.
