Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(n)` creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries, which perfectly matches the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of `n` empty dictionaries, without any missing functionalities or edge cases. Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the annotations support this correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
