Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries, where `n` is a non-negative integer. The function returns a list containing `{}` repeated `n` times, which directly meets the requirement specified in the problem description. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
