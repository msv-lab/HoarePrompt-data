Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1(n)` creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, creating a list of length `n` where each element is an empty dictionary. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned that would invalidate the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
