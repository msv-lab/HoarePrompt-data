Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries for any non-negative integer input `n`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a non-negative integer and returning a list of `n` empty dictionaries. There are no edge cases or potential inputs where this function would fail given the constraints of the problem description and the provided output hints. Thus, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
