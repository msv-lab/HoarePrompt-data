Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries for any positive integer input `n`. This meets the requirements specified in the problem description. There are no edge cases or potential inputs where this function would fail as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. Thus, the program is correct.
