Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list containing `n` empty dictionaries. Specifically:

- The function uses a list comprehension to create a list.
- Inside the list comprehension, `{}` is used to create an empty dictionary.
- The `for _ in range(n)` part ensures that this empty dictionary is repeated `n` times.
- Therefore, for any non-negative integer `n`, the function will generate a list with exactly `n` empty dictionaries, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
