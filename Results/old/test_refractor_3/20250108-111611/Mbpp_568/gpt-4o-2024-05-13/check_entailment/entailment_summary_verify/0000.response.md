Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly generates a list of `N` empty dictionaries, as evidenced by the assertions and the output hints. The code uses a list comprehension to ensure that the returned list contains exactly `N` empty dictionaries, and there are no indications of any edge cases or missing functionalities that would invalidate the correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
