Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the output hints. The function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries, as demonstrated by the assertions. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a non-negative integer `N` and returning a list of `N` empty dictionaries. Since the function meets the requirements and the provided examples and output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
