Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries, as evidenced by the assertions. The annotation clearly states that the function returns a list containing `N` dictionaries, each represented as `{}`, which matches the problem description. No edge cases or invalid inputs are mentioned, and the provided assertions confirm the function's behavior. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
