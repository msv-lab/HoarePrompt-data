Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list containing exactly `N` empty dictionaries. The assertions in the code cover several cases (5, 6, and 7) and show that the function works as expected. The output hints also confirm that the function meets the problem description for every potential case. Since the code handles the specified cases correctly and the problem description does not mention any specific edge cases or additional requirements, the program is correct.
