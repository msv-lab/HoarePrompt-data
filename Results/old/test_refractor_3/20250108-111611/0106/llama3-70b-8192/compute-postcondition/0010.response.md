`min_floor_time` is assigned the value \((b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10\). Given that `a_floor` is \((a - 1) \% m + 1\) and `b_floor` is \((b - 1) \% m + 1\), and knowing that `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, we can directly use these expressions.

Since `a_floor` and `b_floor` are already calculated and are specific values derived from `a` and `b`, we substitute them into the formula for `min_floor_time`.

The formula becomes:
\[ min_floor_time = ((b - 1) \% m + 1 - (a - 1) \% m + 1) * 5 + 10 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ min_floor_time = ((b - 1) \% m - (a - 1) \% m) * 5 + 10 \]

Given the initial conditions and the calculation, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a_floor` is \((a - 1) \% m + 1\), `a_block` is \((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1\), `b_floor` is \((b - 1) \% m + 1\), `b_block` is \((b - 1) // (m * k) + 1\), `min_block_time` is \(min(abs((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 - (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1), n - abs((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 - (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1)) * 15\), `min_floor_time` is \(((b - 1) \% m - (a - 1) \% m) * 5 + 10**
