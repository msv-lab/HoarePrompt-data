`b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. This updates the value of `b_block` based on the previous values of `b`, `m`, and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a_floor` is \((a - 1) \% m + 1\), `a_block` is \((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1\), `b_floor` is \((b - 1) \% m + 1\), `b_block` is \((b - 1) // (m * k) + 1\)**
