    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are integers from the input, `m` and `k` are input integers, `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated as \((a - 1) \% m + 1\) and \((b - 1) \% m + 1\), `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated as \((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1\) and \((b - 1) // (m * k) + 1\), `min_block_time` is calculated as \(min(abs((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 - (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1), n - abs((a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 - (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1)) * 15\). If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is set to \((a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10\). Otherwise, `min_floor_time` is set to \(((b - 1) \% m - (a - 1) \% m) * 5 + 10\).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the minimum time required for two people to meet in a grid-like structure where the grid is divided into blocks and floors. It takes as input the dimensions of the grid (n, m, k), and the positions of two people (a and b). The function first computes the floor and block indices for both positions. It then determines the minimum time required to travel between the blocks and the minimum time required to travel between the floors. Finally, it prints the sum of these times. Potential edge cases include when the positions a and b are in the same block or floor. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-positive integers or values exceeding the specified bounds.
