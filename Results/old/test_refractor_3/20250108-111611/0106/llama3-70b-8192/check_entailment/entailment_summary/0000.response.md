Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not consider the possibility of the apartments being on the same floor but different blocks. Additionally, it does not account for the scenario where the apartments are on the same block but different floors.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
4 10 5
201 206
```

In this case:
- Apartment 201 is on the 10th floor of the 4th block.
- Apartment 206 is on the 1st floor of the 4th block.

The correct solution would involve:
1. Moving from apartment 201 to the 1st floor of the 4th block using the elevator (10 seconds to wait + 1 second to go down to the 1st floor).
2. Walking around the building to reach the 1st floor of the 4th block (3 * 15 = 45 seconds, as it is on the 4th block and we need to walk past 3 other blocks).
3. Walking up to the 1st floor of the 4th block (no additional time needed as we are already on the 1st floor).

The total time should be \(10 + 45 = 55\) seconds. However, the provided code does not account for this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
