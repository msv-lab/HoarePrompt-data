Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment by considering all possible routes around the circular building and using either stairs or the elevator optimally.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Calculation of `min_block_time`:**
   - The formula used to calculate `min_block_time` only considers the difference in blocks (or sub-apartments) between Edward's and Natasha's apartments. However, it does not account for the fact that Edward can potentially go in the opposite direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) to minimize the number of blocks he needs to traverse. This is crucial because moving in the opposite direction might reduce the number of blocks significantly, which would then reduce the overall time taken.

2. **Calculation of `min_floor_time`:**
   - The logic for calculating `min_floor_time` is flawed. The program calculates the time required to travel between floors directly without considering whether the optimal route involves using the elevator. For example, if Edward is on a higher floor and needs to go down, the elevator should be used, but the program only considers the direct stair travel.

3. **Optimal Use of Elevator:**
   - The problem statement mentions that the elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor to move up or down. The program does not take into account the optimal use of the elevator, which can significantly reduce the travel time, especially for larger distances.

4. **Comprehensive Route Calculation:**
   - The program lacks a comprehensive approach to consider all possible routes around the circular building and the optimal use of stairs and the elevator. It only considers the direct difference in blocks and floors without exploring alternative paths or the use of the elevator.

To ensure the program meets the problem description, it should:
- Consider all possible directions (clockwise and counterclockwise) to find the shortest path in terms of blocks.
- Optimize the use of the elevator for large floor differences.
- Ensure that the program handles all edge cases, such as when the apartments are in adjacent blocks or when they are far apart in different parts of the building.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
