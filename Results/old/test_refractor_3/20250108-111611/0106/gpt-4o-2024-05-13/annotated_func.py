    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= n * m * k and a != b, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= n * m * k and a != b, `block_a` is the first return value of `get_location(a)`, `floor_a` is the second return value of `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is the first return value of `get_location(b)`, `floor_b` is the second return value of `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` equals 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `floor_a` is not equal to 1 and `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)`.
    direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15
    reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15

    time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5
    total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor

    #The program returns total_time which is calculated as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates and returns the `total_time` required for a person to move from the location corresponding to `a` to the location corresponding to `b` in a building with `n` floors, `m` blocks per floor, and `k` elevators per block. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the steps and actions performed:

1. The function first determines the floor and block positions of both `a` and `b` using the `get_location` function.
2. Based on the floor position of `a`, it calculates the `time_to_exit` required to exit the elevator, which is 0 if `a` is on the ground floor (i.e., `floor_a == 1`) or `10 + (floor_a - 1)` otherwise.
3. It calculates the `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` required to walk directly or reverse direction between the blocks corresponding to `a` and `b`, considering the modulus operation to wrap around the block count.
4. The `min_walk_time` is determined as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
5. The `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `5 * (floor_b - 1)` because each floor above the ground floor takes 5 units of time to reach.
6. Finally, the `total_time` is computed as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

The function handles all valid inputs for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` within their specified ranges and correctly calculates the total time required for the movement. Edge cases such as when `a` or `b` is on the ground floor are appropriately handled.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: apartment is an integer representing the apartment number within the range [1, n*m*k], where n, m, and k are the number of blocks (apartments buildings), the number of floors in each block, and the number of apartments per floor, respectively, all of which are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.
def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #`block` is calculated as (`apartment - 1`) // (`m * k`) + 1 and `floor` is calculated as (((`apartment - 1`) % (`m * k`)) // `k`) + 1, both `block` and `floor` are returned
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` and returns the corresponding block and floor numbers. Given the apartment number, the function calculates the block number using the formula `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and the floor number using the formula `floor = ((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1`. 

The function handles the case where `apartment` is within the valid range `[1, n*m*k]`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are the number of blocks, floors per block, and apartments per floor, respectively, all being positive integers with bounds 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. If the input `apartment` is outside this range, the function will still compute block and floor based on the given formulas, but these results may not have practical meaning in the context of the building layout.

There are no explicit checks for the input value of `apartment` being within the specified range [1, n*m*k]. Therefore, if `apartment` is outside this range, the output block and floor might be incorrect or undefined. However, the function still processes the input according to the provided formulas.
