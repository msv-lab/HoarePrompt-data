The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number within the range [1, n*m*k], where `n`, `m`, and `k` are the number of blocks, the number of floors in each block, and the number of apartments per floor, respectively, all of which are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.

The function calculates `block` as (`apartment - 1`) // (`m * k`) + 1 and `floor` as (((`apartment - 1`) % (`m * k`)) // `k`) + 1, and then returns both `block` and `floor`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding block and floor numbers based on the given formulae.
