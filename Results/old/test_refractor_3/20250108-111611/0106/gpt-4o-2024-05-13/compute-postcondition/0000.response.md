The code calculates the block number (`block`) based on the apartment number (`apartment`). The formula used is `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. This means that the block number is determined by dividing the apartment number by the total number of apartments per block (m * k), rounding down, and then adding 1.

Since the initial state does not specify specific values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `apartment`, we can express the output state in terms of these variables. After executing the code, the value of `block` is determined by the given formula.

Output State: **`block` is `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `apartment` is an integer within the range [1, n*m*k], `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000**.
