`floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The value of `block` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. The value of `apartment` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `block` is `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `apartment` is an integer within the range [1, n*m*k]; `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `floor_within_block` is `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.

Output State: **`block` is `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `apartment` is an integer within the range [1, n*m*k]; `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `floor_within_block` is `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`**
