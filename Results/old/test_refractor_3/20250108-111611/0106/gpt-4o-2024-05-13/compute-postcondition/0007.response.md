The code calculates `direct_walk_time` based on the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `block_a`, `block_b`, `time_to_exit`, or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `direct_walk_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= n * m * k and a != b, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= n * m * k and a != b, `block_a` is the first return value of `get_location(a)`, `floor_a` is the second return value of `get_location(a)`, `block_b` is the first return value of `get_location(b)`, `floor_b` is the second return value of `get_location(b)`, `time_to_exit` is `10 + (floor_a - 1)` if `floor_a` != 1 else 0, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`**
