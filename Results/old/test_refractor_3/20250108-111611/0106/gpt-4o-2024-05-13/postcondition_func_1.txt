The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` and returns the corresponding block and floor numbers. Given the apartment number, the function calculates the block number using the formula `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and the floor number using the formula `floor = ((apartment - 1) % (m * k)) // k + 1`. 

The function handles the case where `apartment` is within the valid range `[1, n*m*k]`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are the number of blocks, floors per block, and apartments per floor, respectively, all being positive integers with bounds 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. If the input `apartment` is outside this range, the function will still compute block and floor based on the given formulas, but these results may not have practical meaning in the context of the building layout.

There are no explicit checks for the input value of `apartment` being within the specified range [1, n*m*k]. Therefore, if `apartment` is outside this range, the output block and floor might be incorrect or undefined. However, the function still processes the input according to the provided formulas.
