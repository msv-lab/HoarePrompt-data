Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Function `get_location`**: This function correctly calculates the block and floor of a given apartment number. It divides the apartment number by \(m \times k\) to get the block and uses the modulus operation to find the floor within that block.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
   - **Time to Exit**: If Edward is already on the first floor, no additional time is needed to exit the current floor.
   - **Direct Walk Time**: Computes the time to walk directly from Edward's block to Natasha's block in the direction of fewer blocks.
   - **Reverse Walk Time**: Computes the time to walk in the opposite direction (i.e., clockwise).
   - **Minimum Walk Time**: Chooses the minimum of the direct and reverse walk times.
   - **Time to Target Floor**: Calculates the time required to walk up to Natasha's floor.
   - **Total Time**: Sums up all the times calculated above.

The logic in both functions aligns with the problem description and handles all edge cases, such as when Edward and Natasha are in the same block, different blocks, and different floors. The program also considers the special conditions like using the elevator and walking times accurately.

Since the program handles all described scenarios correctly and there are no apparent issues or missing cases, the correctness is **True**.
