Example Answer:
If `x` is less than 0, `x` is negated, and `y` is decremented by the absolute value of `x`. Since `i` is less than 0, the value of `r` is updated by multiplying `shares` with `b[i]`. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **If `x` is less than 0, `x` is negated, `y` is decremented by the absolute value of `x`, and `r` is updated by shares times b[i].**
