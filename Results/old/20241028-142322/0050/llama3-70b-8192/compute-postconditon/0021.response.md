Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Since the initial state doesn't specify any specific values for the variables, the output state is: `a, b, c` are integers, `i` is less than 0, and we break out of the loop or if statement.
Output State: **`a, b, c` are integers, `i` is less than 0, and we break out of the loop or if statement**
