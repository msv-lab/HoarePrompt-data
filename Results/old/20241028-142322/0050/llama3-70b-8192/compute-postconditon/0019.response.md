Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. The previous values of `shares`, `r`, and `s[i]` are unknown, so the output state is: `a, b, c` are integers, `i` is less than 0, `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`.
Output State: **`a, b, c` are integers, `i` is less than 0, `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`**
