Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The function described in the initial state is not called or executed. Therefore, the output state is: `a, b, c` are integers, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`a, b, c` are integers, `i` is increased by 1**
