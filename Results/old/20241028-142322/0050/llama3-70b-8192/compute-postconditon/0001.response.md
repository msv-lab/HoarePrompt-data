Example Answer:
The input is split based on spaces and converted to a list of integers stored in variable `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000**
