Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` function. The previous values of the list `b` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific values after sorting. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input and it is sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input and it is sorted in ascending order**
