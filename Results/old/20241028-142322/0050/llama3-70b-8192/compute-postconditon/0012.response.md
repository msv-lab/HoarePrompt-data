According to the code, the loop condition is `i < 0`. Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0 after the increment. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which should be less than 0.
State: **`a, b, c` are integers, `i` is less than 0**
