Postcondition: **`a, b, c` are integers, `i` is less than 0. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is not greater than or equal to `s[i]`, the program exits the loop or if statement.**
