Example Answer:
`n, m, r` are assigned the values from the input after splitting by space. The values of `n, m, r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is `n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n, m, r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000**
