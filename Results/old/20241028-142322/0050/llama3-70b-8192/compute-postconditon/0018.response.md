According to the code, the loop condition is `i < 0`, which means the loop will only execute if `i` is less than 0. However, since `i` is already less than 0, the loop will not execute again based on the current state.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`a, b, c` are integers, `i` is less than 0**
