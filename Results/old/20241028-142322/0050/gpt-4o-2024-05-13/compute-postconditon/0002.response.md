Example Answer:
The list `b` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown, and the list `s` is created from the input, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input, `s` is a list of integers created from the input**
