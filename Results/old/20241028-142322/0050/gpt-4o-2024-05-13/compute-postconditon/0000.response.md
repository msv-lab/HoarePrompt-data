Example Answer:
The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values by mapping the input that is split. The input is converted to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` depend on the input values provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned integer values based on the input**
