Example Answer:
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The values of the other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, and `b` is a list containing integers from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, and `b` is a list containing integers from the input**
