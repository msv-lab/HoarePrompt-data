Postcondition: **If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to the initial state as the break statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement without affecting the variables.**
