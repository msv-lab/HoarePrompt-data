Postcondition: **If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and the `i-th` element of list `b`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the loop breaks. In both cases, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial values. If `i` is less than 1 initially, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` remain the same. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1 initially, `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the range [1, 30] for `n` and `m`, and [1, 1000] for `r`, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `shares` holds the total shares calculated, and `i` retains its value after the loop execution.**
