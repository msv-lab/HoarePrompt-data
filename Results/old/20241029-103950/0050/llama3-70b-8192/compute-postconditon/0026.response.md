Output State: **If `i` is less than 1 initially: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` remain the same as the initial state. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1 initially: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `shares` holds the total shares calculated, and `i` is the value of the loop control variable after the loop finishes.**
