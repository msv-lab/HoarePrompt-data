Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i` are positive integers. `n`, `m` satisfy 1 <= n, m <= 30, and `r` satisfies 1 <= r <= 1000. `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. `shares` is the result of previous shares incremented by r // s[i] if r is greater than or equal to s[i]. If r is less than s[i], the loop breaks. `i` is a positive integer between 1 and 30. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], `shares` is incremented by r // s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of the division r // s[i]. If r is less than s[i], the loop breaks. `i` is increased by 1.**
