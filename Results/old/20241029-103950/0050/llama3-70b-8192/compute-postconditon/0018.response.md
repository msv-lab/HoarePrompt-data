According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 0. However, this condition seems to be incorrect as `i` is a positive integer between 1 and 30. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again based on the given condition. No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i` remain the same**
