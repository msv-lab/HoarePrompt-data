According to the code, the loop condition is `i < 0`. Since `i` is the only variable involved in the loop condition, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 0 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, the state remains unchanged.
State: **No changes are made to the initial state as the break statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement without affecting the variables**
