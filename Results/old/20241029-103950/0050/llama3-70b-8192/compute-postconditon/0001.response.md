Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input string by spaces and converting them to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers from the input**
