Example Answer:
The variable `shares` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state remains as follows:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a sorted list containing integers from the input, and `b` is a list containing integers from the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0**
