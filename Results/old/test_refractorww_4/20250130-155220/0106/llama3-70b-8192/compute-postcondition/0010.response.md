Output State: **`a_floor` is equal to (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is ((a - 1) // (m * k)) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15, `min_floor_time` is (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10, `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input split and converted to integers, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b, and `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`**.

In natural language: The value of `a_floor` remains `(a - 1) % m + 1`, the value of `a_block` remains `((a - 1) // (m * k)) + 1`, the value of `b_floor` remains `(b - 1) % m + 1`, the value of `b_block` remains `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, the value of `min_block_time` remains as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`, and `min_floor_time` is now `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned from the input and converted to integers, `a` and `b` are integers from input, and the conditions `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k` and `a ≠ b` and `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor` still hold.
