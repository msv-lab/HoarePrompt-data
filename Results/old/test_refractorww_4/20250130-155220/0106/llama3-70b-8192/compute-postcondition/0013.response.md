Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Based on the provided information, the function does not take any parameters (n, m, k, a, or b). The problem constraints and relationships between the input parameters are given but not used within the function definition itself. Since no actions or return values are specified in the question, the only logical conclusion is that the function does not perform any operation and thus has no parameters and returns nothing.
