Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from input split and converted to integers, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively, converting each to an integer. The initial conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged, meaning they are still integers within the specified range and are not equal to each other.
