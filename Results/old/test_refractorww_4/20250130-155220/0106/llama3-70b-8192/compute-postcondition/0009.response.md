Postcondition: **`a_floor` is equal to (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is ((a - 1) // (m * k)) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15, `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input split and converted to integers, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b, and `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`**
