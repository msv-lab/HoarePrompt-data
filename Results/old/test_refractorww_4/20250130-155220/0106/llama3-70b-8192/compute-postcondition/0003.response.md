Output State: **`a_floor` is equal to (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is ((a - 1) // (m * k)) + 1, `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input split and converted to integers, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**

Explanation: The code calculates `a_block` as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. It does not affect the values of `a_floor`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. The previous values of these variables remain unchanged, and the new value of `a_block` is calculated based on the input value of `a`.
