Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code does not address the scenario where the optimal path involves using the lift within the same block. Specifically, the calculation of `min_floor_time` does not account for the possibility of using the lift to move between floors within the same block. This oversight leads to incorrect time calculations in certain scenarios, as illustrated in the example provided. For instance, in the case where Edvard and Natasha are in the same block but on different floors, the program should use the lift to minimize the travel time, but it currently does not do so. Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment in all possible scenarios.
