Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the optimal path involves using the lift within the same block. The output hints confirm that the program assumes a minimum floor time calculation without considering the use of the lift, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios. For instance, in the given example, the program calculates the minimum floor time as 20 seconds, resulting in an incorrect total time of 35 seconds instead of the expected 25 seconds. Therefore, the program needs to handle the case where the lift can be used within the same block to achieve the minimum time.
