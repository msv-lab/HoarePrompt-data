### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function correctly parses the inputs `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It also correctly parses the apartment numbers `a` and `b` from the second line.

2. **Floor Calculation:**
   - For apartment number `a`, the floor is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`. This is correct because it determines the floor number by taking the remainder of `a-1` divided by `m`.
   - Similarly, for apartment number `b`, the floor is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`.

3. **Block Calculation:**
   - The block number for apartment `a` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. This is correct because it divides `a-1` by the total number of apartments per block (`m * k`) and adds 1 to get the block number.
   - The same logic applies to apartment `b`.

4. **Time Calculation:**
   - The time to move between blocks (`min_block_time`) is calculated correctly using the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. This ensures that the minimum time to move between blocks is taken into account, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
   - The time to move between floors (`min_floor_time`) is calculated correctly. If `a_floor > b_floor`, the time is `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` (waiting 10 seconds for the elevator plus the time to go down by stairs). If `a_floor <= b_floor`, the time is `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function correctly outputs the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

Given the above analysis, the provided Python program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
