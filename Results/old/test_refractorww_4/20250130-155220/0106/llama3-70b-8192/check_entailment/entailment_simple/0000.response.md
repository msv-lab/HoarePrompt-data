### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Calculation of Floor and Block Numbers:**
   - The program correctly calculates the floor (`a_floor`, `b_floor`) and block (`a_block`, `b_block`) numbers for both `a` and `b`. This is done using modular arithmetic and integer division.
   
2. **Calculating Minimum Time to Change Blocks:**
   - The logic to calculate `min_block_time` is correct. It computes the minimum time needed to move from one block to another by either moving directly or going around the entire building. This is computed as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Time to Change Floors:**
   - The logic to calculate `min_floor_time` is also correct. It considers the direction of movement between floors and adds the necessary waiting time for the elevator (10 seconds).

4. **Final Time Calculation:**
   - The final time is correctly calculated by summing `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the blocks and floors are different and ensures that the correct minimum time is chosen whether the movement is direct or involves going around the building.

Given that all parts of the program align with the problem statement and the calculations are logically sound, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The annotated program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem and correctly computes the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.
