Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial conditions for `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b) remain unchanged because `a` and `b` are not mentioned in the code. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, but they still follow the condition 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.
