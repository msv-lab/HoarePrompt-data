Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer from input and `b` is an integer from input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The conditions on `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b) remain valid. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged.
