Output State: **`a` is an integer from input and `b` is an integer from input; `a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `a_block` based on the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `a_floor` and `b` remain unchanged. `a` and `b` are still integers from input, and `a_floor` is still calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
