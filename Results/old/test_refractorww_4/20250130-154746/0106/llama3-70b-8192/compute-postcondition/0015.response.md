Output State: **`min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`; `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_floor_time` is `(abs(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10)`, and the value printed is `min_block_time + min_floor_time`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` as described and then prints their sum. The values of `min_block_time`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, and `min_floor_time` are used in the calculation of the printed value, but their specific values are not provided here, so they remain as described in the initial state.
