Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input; `a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `b_floor` as `(b - 1) % m + 1`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new value of `b_floor` is specifically defined by the operation `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
