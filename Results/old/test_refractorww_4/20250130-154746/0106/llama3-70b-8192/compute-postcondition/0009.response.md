Output State: **`min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15, `a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and `min_floor_time` is (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10, where `a_floor` > `b_floor`.**

This means that `min_block_time`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` remain unchanged from their initial state, and a new variable `min_floor_time` has been introduced and set to the value `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`, given that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.
