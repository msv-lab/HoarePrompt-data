Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly handle the circular nature of the building and the optimal path between blocks. Specifically:

1. The calculation of `min_block_time` does not properly account for the circular movement between blocks. For instance, if `a_block` is 4 and `b_block` is 1, the current implementation calculates the time as if there were no circular connection, which is incorrect.
2. The calculation of `min_floor_time` does not consider the scenario where Edvard needs to move between floors after reaching the target block, especially if the target floor is below the starting floor.

The output hints confirm these issues. The hints indicate that the function should handle both block and floor transitions optimally, but the provided code does not fully address these requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program does not meet the problem description as intended.
