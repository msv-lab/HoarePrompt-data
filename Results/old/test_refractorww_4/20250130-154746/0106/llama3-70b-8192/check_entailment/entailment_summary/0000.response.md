Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully handle the cases where the input values for `a` and `b` are in the same block but different floors. Specifically, the code calculates the minimum time to move between blocks and floors, but it does not account for the possibility that the minimum time could be achieved by moving directly between the floors within the same block using the elevator. 

For example, consider the following scenario:
- Input: `4 10 5`
- `a = 200`
- `b = 205`

In this case, both `a` and `b` are in the same block (4th block) but on different floors (10th floor and 11th floor, respectively). The current implementation would calculate the time to move between blocks and then use the elevator, but it does not check if moving directly between the floors using the elevator within the same block is faster.

To fix this, the code needs to include a check to see if the difference in floors is less than the time it takes to move between blocks using the elevator (10 seconds + 1 second per floor). If this condition is met, the code should calculate the time to move directly between the floors using the elevator.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to include this check:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
    a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
    b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1

    # Calculate time to move between blocks
    min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
    if a_block == b_block:
        # Same block, calculate time to move between floors
        min_floor_time = abs(a_floor - b_floor)
    else:
        # Move to the same block using elevator
        min_floor_time = 10 + abs(a_floor - b_floor)

    print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum time for all potential cases.
