Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The code correctly parses the input, calculates the floor and block numbers for both Edvard's and Natasha's apartments, and computes the minimum travel time considering both block and floor movements. The logic for determining the minimum time to travel between blocks and floors is sound and matches the problem requirements. The annotated version further clarifies that the code handles the problem correctly by breaking down each step and ensuring that the calculations are appropriate for the given constraints. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
