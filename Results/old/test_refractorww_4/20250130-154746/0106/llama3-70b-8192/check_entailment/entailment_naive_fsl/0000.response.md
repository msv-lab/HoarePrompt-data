Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem description. It first determines the floor and block numbers for both apartments, then calculates the minimum time required to either move between blocks using the lift or walk between floors, considering the constraints and rules of the building. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
