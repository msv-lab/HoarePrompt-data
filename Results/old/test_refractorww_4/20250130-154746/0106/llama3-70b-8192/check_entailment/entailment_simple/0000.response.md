### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Calculation of Floor and Block Numbers**:
   - The program correctly calculates the floor (`a_floor`, `b_floor`) and block (`a_block`, `b_block`) numbers for both `a` and `b` using the formulas:
     ```python
     a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
     b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```
   - These calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Time to Move Between Blocks**:
   - The formula used to calculate `min_block_time` is:
     ```python
     min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
     ```
   - This accounts for both direct movement and the circular nature of the building when moving between blocks. It is correct as it considers the shortest path either clockwise or counterclockwise.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Time to Move Between Floors Within a Block**:
   - The formula used to calculate `min_floor_time` is:
     ```python
     if (a_floor > b_floor):
         min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
     else:
         min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
     ```
   - This formula correctly accounts for the time taken to move between floors within a block, adding an initial 10 seconds for the lift (which arrives after 10 seconds).

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final output is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`:
     ```python
     print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
     ```
   - This ensures that the total minimum time is calculated correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program logic appears to be correct and matches the problem requirements.
