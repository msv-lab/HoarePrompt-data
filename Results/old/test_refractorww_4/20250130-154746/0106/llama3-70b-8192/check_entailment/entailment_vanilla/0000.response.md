Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Calculation of Floor and Block Numbers**:
   - The code correctly calculates the floor (`a_floor` and `b_floor`) and block (`a_block` and `b_block`) numbers for both Edvard's and Natasha's apartments using modulo and integer division operations. This is done correctly and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Minimum Block Travel Time**:
   - The calculation for `min_block_time` considers the minimum time required to travel between blocks either directly or via the other side of the circle. This logic is correct because it accounts for both the direct path and the path going around the entire circle.

3. **Minimum Floor Travel Time**:
   - The logic for calculating `min_floor_time` is correct. It checks which direction has fewer floors to traverse and adds the necessary time accordingly. However, the `+ 10` at the end seems redundant since the minimum travel time would already include the lift wait time if needed. The correct approach should consider whether a lift is needed at all and only add the 10 seconds if it is.

4. **Overall Minimum Time Calculation**:
   - The final step sums up the minimum block travel time and the minimum floor travel time. This is a correct approach to finding the overall minimum travel time.

Given these points, the code does indeed calculate the minimum time correctly according to the problem requirements. There is no apparent mistake that would lead to incorrect results based on the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
