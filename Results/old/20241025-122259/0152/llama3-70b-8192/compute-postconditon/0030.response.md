Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of affected variables are `j` is 0, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j]`, and `ans` is updated based on the comparison. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j]`, `ans` is updated based on the comparison, and `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j]`, `ans` is updated based on the comparison, `i` is increased by 1**
