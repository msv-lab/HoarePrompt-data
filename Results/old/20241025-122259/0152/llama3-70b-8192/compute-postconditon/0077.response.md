Output State: **`n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5; `j` is equal to one less than the number of iterations the loop ran, `s_left` is decreased by the sum of `d[j]` for all iterations the loop ran. If `j` is not equal to -1, then `cnt` is updated to the value of `c[j]`. `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current value of `ans` and the expression `(n - cnt + t - 1) // t * t`**
