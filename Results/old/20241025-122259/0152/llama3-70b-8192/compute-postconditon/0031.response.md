According to the code, the loop will only execute if `i` is less than 0. Since `i` is already 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be adjusted to be less than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`j` is 0, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j]`, `ans` is updated based on the comparison, `i` is -1**
