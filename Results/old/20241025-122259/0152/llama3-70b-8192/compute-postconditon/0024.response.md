Output State: **If `k` is 0 or `s_left` is less than `d[0]`, the loop will not start. In that case, all variables remain the same as the initial state. If `k` is 1 and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[0]`, the loop will execute once. After 1 iteration, `j` is equal to 1, and `s_left` is decreased by `d[1]`. If `k` is greater than 1 and `s_left` is greater than or equal to `d[0]`, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop finishes, `j` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and `s_left` is decreased by the sum of `d[1]` to `d[j]`. All other variables remain the same as the initial state.**
