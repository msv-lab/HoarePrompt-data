Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `j` is 1, so after execution, `j` becomes 2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5; `j` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5; `j` is 2**
