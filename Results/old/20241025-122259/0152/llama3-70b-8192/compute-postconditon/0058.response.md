Postcondition: **`num1`, `num2` are integers, `i` is increased by 2. If `i` is equal to `m`, then `t` is assigned the value of `x`. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value at index `i` of list `a`.**

Precondition: `n` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    n = -n
elif n == 0:
    return 0
else:
    n -= 5

```
Postcondition for if body: `n` is an integer. If `n` is less than 0, `n` is negated.
Postcondition for else body: If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 5.
Postcondition: **`n` is an integer. If `n` is less than 0, `n` is negated. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 5.**
