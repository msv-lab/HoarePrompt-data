Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `cnt` is either 0 or the value of `c[j]`, `ans` is updated based on the comparison, `i` is -1. If `i` is equal to `m`, then `t` is assigned the value of `x`. Otherwise, `t` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. If `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `j` remains 0, `cnt` remains as described, `ans` is updated accordingly, `i` remains -1, and `t` is assigned the value of `a[i]`.**
