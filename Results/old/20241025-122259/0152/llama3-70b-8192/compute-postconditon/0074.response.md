Example Answer:
The code snippet initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the initial state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5; `j` is equal to one less than the number of iterations the loop ran, `s_left` is decreased by the sum of `d[j]` for all iterations the loop ran. `cnt` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, if `b[i]` is greater than `s`, then `n` is negated if it is less than 0, if `n` is 0, the function returns 0, otherwise `n` is decreased by 5; `j` is equal to one less than the number of iterations the loop ran, `s_left` is decreased by the sum of `d[j]` for all iterations the loop ran. `cnt` is 0**
