Example Answer:
The list `d` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The input values are obtained from the user's input and split by spaces. The values in the list `d` are integers. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values within the specified ranges, `x` and `s` are assigned input integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is a list of integers created from the input, and `d` is a list of integers obtained from the user input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values within the specified ranges, `x` and `s` are assigned input integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is a list of integers created from the input, and `d` is a list of integers obtained from the user input**
