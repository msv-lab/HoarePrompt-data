Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned the value of `k`, but the previous values of `k` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `min_time` is the result of `n * x` within valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the result of `n * x` within valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k`**
