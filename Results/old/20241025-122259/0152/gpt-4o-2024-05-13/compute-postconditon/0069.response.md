Example Answer: 
The variable `time_with_both_spells` is calculated by multiplying `remaining_potions` with `a[i]`. The value of `remaining_potions` is determined by taking the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`. The Output State is: `j` is assigned the value of `k`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`, and `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`.
Output State: **`j` is assigned the value of `k`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`**
