Example Answer: 
The variable `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. The values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is less than -1, `k` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is the product of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum value.
