Output State: **If `j` is equal to `k` and `k` is less than 0, the loop will not be executed. All variables will remain the same as the initial state. If `j` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop will execute until `j` becomes 0. The final state will depend on the conditions inside the loop as described in the examples above. After the loop, `j` will be equal to 0 or greater, and other variables will be updated based on the loop's logic.**
