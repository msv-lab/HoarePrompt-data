Example Answer:
`remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`. The initial state states that `n * x` is within a valid range, and `i` is assigned the value of `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_time` is the result of `n * x` within valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k`, and `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the result of `n * x` within valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k`, and `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and `n - c[i]`**
