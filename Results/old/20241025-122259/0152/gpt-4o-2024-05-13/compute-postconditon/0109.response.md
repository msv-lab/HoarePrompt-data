Example Answer:
`remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum of 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`. The value of `n` can vary based on previous conditions, and `c[j]` is a constant value. After calculation, the value of `remaining_potions` will be the maximum of 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`. Therefore, the output state is: `num` is either updated based on the conditions described above, `j` is less than or equal to 1, and `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`.
Output State: **`num` is either updated based on the conditions described above, `j` is less than or equal to 1, and `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`**
