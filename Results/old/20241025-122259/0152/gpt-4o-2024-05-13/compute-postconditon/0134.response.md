Example Answer:
`d` is assigned a list created by mapping the `int` function to a slice of `data` starting from index `5 + 2 * m + k` and ending at index `5 + 2 * m + 2 * k`. The previous values of `data`, `m`, `k`, and other variables are known, so the output state is: `data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`, `k` is an integer value, `x` is an integer value extracted from the 4th element of `data`, `s` is equal to `x`, `a` is a list of integers from index 5 to 5 + m in `data`, `b` is a list of integers from index 5 + m to 5 + 2 * m in `data`, `c` is a list created by mapping `int` function to a slice of `data`, `d` is a list created by mapping `int` function to a slice of `data` starting from index `5 + 2 * m + k` and ending at index `5 + 2 * m + 2 * k`.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value, `k` is an integer value, `x` is an integer value, `s` is equal to `x`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of integers, `d` is a list of integers**
