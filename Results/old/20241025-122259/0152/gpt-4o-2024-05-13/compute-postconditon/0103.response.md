Example Answer:
`remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`. The values of `j` and `k` are less than -1, so their specific values are not known. `time_with_both_spells` is then calculated as `remaining_potions` multiplied by `a[i]`. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is less than -1, `k` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is the product of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`.
Output State: **`j` is less than -1, `k` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is the product of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`**
