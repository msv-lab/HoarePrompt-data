Example Answer:
`time_with_both_spells` is assigned the value of `remaining_potions * a[i]`. The value of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]` are unknown, but all variables remain integers. Since the initial value of `j` is less than 0 and no other information is provided, the output state is: All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is less than 0.
Output State: **All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is less than 0**
