Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value of the second element of `data` converted to an integer. The value of `data` contains split input values, so the value of `m` depends on the second element of `data`. `n` is not affected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`**
