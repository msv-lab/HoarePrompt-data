Postcondition: **All variables remain the same. `j` is equal to `k`. `remaining_manapoints` is calculated as `s - b[i]`. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`. `time_with_both_spells` is calculated based on the aforementioned values. `min_time` is updated to the new minimum value. If `d[j]` is not less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.**
