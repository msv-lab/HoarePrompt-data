Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `n * a[i]`, `i` is less than 0, if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, then `time_with_spell` is calculated as `n * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `min_time` and `time_with_spell`.**
