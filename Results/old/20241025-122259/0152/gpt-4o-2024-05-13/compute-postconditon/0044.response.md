Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: No changes to the variables `i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, or `remaining_manapoints`, `j` is assigned the value of `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
