Example Answer:
The list `b` is created by mapping the integer conversion function to the sublist of `data` from index `5 + m` to `5 + 2 * m`. The values of `m` and `data` are known, so `b` contains integers from index `5 + m` to `5 + 2 * m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`, `k` is an integer value, `x` is an integer value extracted from the 4th element of `data`, `s` is equal to `x`, `a` is a list of integers from index 5 to 5 + m in `data`, `b` is a list of integers from index 5 + m to 5 + 2 * m in `data`.
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`, `k` is an integer value, `x` is an integer value extracted from the 4th element of `data`, `s` is equal to `x`, `a` is a list of integers from index 5 to 5 + m in `data`, `b` is a list of integers from index 5 + m to 5 + 2 * m in `data`**
