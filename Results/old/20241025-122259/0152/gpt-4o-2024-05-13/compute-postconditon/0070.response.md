Example Answer:
`min_time` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `time_with_both_spells`. The previous values of variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is: `j` is assigned the value of `k`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value.
Output State: **`j` is assigned the value of `k`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum value between 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value**
