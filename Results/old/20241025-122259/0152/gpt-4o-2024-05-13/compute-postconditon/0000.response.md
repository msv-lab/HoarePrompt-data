Example Answer:
The variable `min_time` is assigned the value of `n * x`. Since `n` and `x` are given to be integers within the specified ranges, the result of `n * x` will also be within a valid range. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`min_time` is the result of `n * x` within valid range**
