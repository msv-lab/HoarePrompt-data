According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j + 1` is an integer. This implies that `j` is less than 0. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i`, `min_time`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `remaining_manapoints`, `j + 1`, `d` are integers**
