Example Answer:
`remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`, where `n` is the same as before, `c` is an array, and `j` is equal to `k`. The value of `remaining_potions` depends on the values of `n` and `c[j]`. 
Output State: **All variables remain the same, `j` is equal to `k`, `remaining_manapoints` is calculated as `s - b[i]`, `remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum of 0 and `n - c[j]`**
