According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 0. However, `i` is assigned the value of `k` + 1 at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_time` is the result of `n * x` within a valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k` + 1 less than 0**
