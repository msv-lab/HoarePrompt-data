Postcondition: **`j`, `k`, `n`, `c`, `remaining_manapoints`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells`, `min_time`, `a`, `i` are all integers. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `j` is assigned the value of `k`, `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the result of `n - c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is calculated as `remaining_potions * a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum value. If `d[j]` is not less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `j` is assigned the value of `k`.**
