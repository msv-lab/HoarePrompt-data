Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `k`, and `k` retains its initial value. Therefore, after execution, `j` is equal to `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **All variables remain the same, `j` is equal to `k`, `remaining_manapoints` is calculated as `s - b[i]`**
