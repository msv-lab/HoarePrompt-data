Example Answer:
The value of `remaining_potions` is calculated as the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`, where `j` is equal to `k + 1`. Given that `k` is less than -1, the value of `j` will be negative. The output state will be: `j` is less than -1, `k` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`.
Output State: **`j` is less than -1, `k` is less than -1, `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`**
