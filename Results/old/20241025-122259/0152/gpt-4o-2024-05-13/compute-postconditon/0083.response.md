Example Answer:
The value of `time_with_both_spells` is calculated by multiplying `remaining_potions` with `a[i]`. The value of `remaining_potions` is determined by the value of `n` and `c[j]`. The value of `j` is less than 0, so `c[j]` is considered. Therefore, the output state is: All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is less than 0, and `remaining_potions` is calculated based on the value of `n` and `c[j]. `time_with_both_spells` is calculated accordingly.
Output State: **All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is less than 0, and `remaining_potions` is calculated based on the value of `n` and `c[j]. `time_with_both_spells` is calculated accordingly.**
