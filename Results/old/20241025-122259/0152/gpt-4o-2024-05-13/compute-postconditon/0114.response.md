Output State: **`d` is a list, `remaining_manapoints`, `n`, `c`, `a`, `min_time`, `remaining_potions`, `time_with_both_spells` are integers. If `d[j]` is less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, then `remaining_potions` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `c[j]`, `time_with_both_spells` is the product of `remaining_potions` and `a[i]`, and `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `min_time` and `time_with_both_spells`. If `d[j]` is not less than or equal to `remaining_manapoints`, the loop breaks. `j` is less than or equal to 2.**
