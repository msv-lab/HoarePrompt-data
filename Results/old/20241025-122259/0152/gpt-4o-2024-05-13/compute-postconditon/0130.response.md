Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the integer value extracted from the 4th element of `data`, which is `x`. Therefore, after execution, `s` will be equal to `x`. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`data` contains the split input values, `n` is an integer value, `m` is an integer value extracted from the second element of `data`, `k` is an integer value, `x` is an integer value extracted from the 4th element of `data`, `s` is equal to `x`**
