Output State: **`min_time` is the result of `n * x` within a valid range, `i` is assigned the value of `k` + 1. If `d[i]` is less than or equal to `s`, `min_time` is updated to be the minimum of the current `min_time` and `time_with_spell`, where `time_with_spell` is calculated as the maximum between 0 and `n - c[i]` multiplied by `x`.**
