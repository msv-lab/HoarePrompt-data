Example Answer: 
`remaining_potions` is assigned the maximum value between 0 and the result of subtracting `c[j]` from `n`. Given that the value of `j` is less than 0, the specific values of `n` and `c` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is less than 0.
Output State: **All variables remain integers, the value of `j` is less than 0**
