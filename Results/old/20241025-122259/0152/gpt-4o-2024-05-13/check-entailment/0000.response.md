Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when both types of spells are used together optimally. It does not consider the scenario where using both types of spells in a specific combination could lead to a faster preparation time than using either type individually. The current implementation only checks each spell independently and does not explore all possible combinations of spell usage to find the minimum time required.
