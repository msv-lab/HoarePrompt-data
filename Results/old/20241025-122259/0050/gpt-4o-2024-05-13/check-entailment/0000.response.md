Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price, then determines the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the current bourles, calculates the remaining bourles after buying shares, and finally computes the total bourles after selling all shares at the maximum sell price. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the requirements stated in the problem description.
