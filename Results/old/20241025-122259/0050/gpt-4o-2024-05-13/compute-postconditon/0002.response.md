Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the list of integers inputted by the user after converting them to integers. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user, constrained between 1 and 1000. `b` is a list of m positive integers after input by the user.
Output State: **Precondition: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user, constrained between 1 and 1000. `b` is a list of m positive integers after input by the user**
