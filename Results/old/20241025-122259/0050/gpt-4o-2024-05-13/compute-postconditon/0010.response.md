Postcondition: **n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user, constrained between 1 and 1000. `b` is a list of m positive integers after input by the user. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`. If max_sell_price is less than or equal to min_buy_price, the function prints r. Otherwise, max_shares is calculated as the integer division of r by min_buy_price, remaining_bourles is the remainder of this division, and total_bourles is obtained by adding the product of max_shares and max_sell_price to remaining_bourles, and then printed.**
