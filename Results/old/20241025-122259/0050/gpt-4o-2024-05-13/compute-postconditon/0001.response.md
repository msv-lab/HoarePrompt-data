Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the values inputted by the user after converting them to integers using `map` and `int`. The values of `s` are constrained to be positive integers between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user, constrained between 1 and 1000. b is a list of m positive integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 1000.
Output State: **Precondition: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s is a list of n positive integers inputted by the user, constrained between 1 and 1000. b is a list of m positive integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 1000.**
