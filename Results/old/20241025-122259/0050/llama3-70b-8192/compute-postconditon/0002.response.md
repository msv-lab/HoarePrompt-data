Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the value of the input split into integers. The input is taken as a string and split into integers based on spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; s is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000, b is a list of integers based on input.
Output State: **n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; s is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000, b is a list of integers based on input**
