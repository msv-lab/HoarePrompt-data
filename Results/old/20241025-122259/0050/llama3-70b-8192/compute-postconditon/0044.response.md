According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than -1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r`, `shares`, and `s` are integers. `i` is less than -1**
