Example Answer:
n, m, and r are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific values of n, m, and r. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s and b are lists of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **n, m, and r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s and b are lists of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000.**
