Example Answer:
If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` will be updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` will be set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop. The loop will not execute if `i` is less than 0 initially. The `print(r)` statement will output the final value of `r`.
Output State: **If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop. If `i` is less than 0 initially, the loop will not execute. The final value of `r` is printed.**
