Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and continues with the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n`, `s`, `total_volume`, `min_keg_volume`, `remaining_kvass`, and `i` are integers**
