Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list. If the total volume of kegs is less than the glass volume, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `min_keg_volume` is updated based on the loop execution, and the final value is printed.**
