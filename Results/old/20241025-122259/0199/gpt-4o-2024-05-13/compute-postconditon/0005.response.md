Example Answer:
`min_keg_volume` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `volumes`. The value of `min_keg_volume` is dependent on the values in the list `volumes`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list, `min_keg_volume` is the volume of the first keg in the list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of kegs, `s` is an integer representing the glass volume, `total_volume` is the sum of volumes in the list, `min_keg_volume` is the volume of the first keg in the list**
