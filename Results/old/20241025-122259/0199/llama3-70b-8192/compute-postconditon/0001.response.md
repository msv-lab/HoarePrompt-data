Example Answer: 
The input is split by spaces and converted into integers, which are then stored in list `v`. The values of `n`, `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are integers within the specified ranges, `v` is a list of integers from the input.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are integers within the specified ranges, `v` is a list of integers from the input**
