Example Answer:
`low` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is the result of the calculation `(low + high + 1) // 2`. The previous values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `total` are known. After the assignment, `low` becomes equal to `mid`, and since `mid` is calculated based on the previous values of `low` and `high`, the new value of `low` is updated accordingly. The value of `total` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low`, `high`, `mid`, `total` have integer values based on the adjustments described above.
Output State: **`low`, `high`, `mid`, `total` have integer values based on the adjustments described above**
