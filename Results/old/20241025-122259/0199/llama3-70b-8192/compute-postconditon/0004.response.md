Example Answer:
`mid` is calculated as the floor division of `(low + high + 1)` by 2. The initial state is `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum value in list `v`. Therefore, the output state is: `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum value in list `v`, `mid` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is the minimum value in list `v`, `mid` is calculated as described**
