Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses binary search to find the maximum possible kvass level in the least keg such that the Fair Nut can pour his glass by s liters of kvass. The program iterates through the kegs and calculates the total kvass that can be poured if each keg is at a certain level. It then adjusts the low and high values based on whether the total is less than s or not. The program correctly handles the cases where the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by s liters of kvass and prints -1 in such scenarios. The binary search approach ensures efficiency in finding the solution.
