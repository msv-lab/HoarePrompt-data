Example Answer:
The value of `speeds[i]` is updated to the minimum value between `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. The previous values of `speeds`, `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, and `i` are known. After calculation, the new value of `speeds[i]` is determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with the updated value at index i, and `i` is 1.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, `t` and `d` are assigned values from input, `speeds` is a list of t elements with the updated value at index i, and `i` is 1**
