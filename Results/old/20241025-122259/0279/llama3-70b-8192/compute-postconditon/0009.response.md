Example Answer:
`min_speed` is assigned the minimum value between the sum of `min_speed` and `d`, and `max_speed`. The values of `min_speed`, `max_speed`, and `d` are not provided, so the output state is: v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is between 1 and 100; min_speed is between 1 and 100; max_length is between t and 100t; min_length is between t and 100t.
Output State: **v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is between 1 and 100; min_speed is between 1 and 100; max_length is between t and 100t; min_length is between t and 100t**
