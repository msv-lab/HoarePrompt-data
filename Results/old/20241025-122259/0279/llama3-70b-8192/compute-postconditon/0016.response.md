Example Answer:
`max_speed` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_speed` minus `d` and `min_speed`. The values of `max_speed`, `min_speed`, and `d` are known, so the new value of `max_speed` can be calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is between 1 and 100; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`; `i` is assigned the next value from the iterator `iter_i`; `max_speed` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ `v1`, `v2` ≤ 100; `t` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting them; `max_speed` is between 1 and 100; `min_speed` is between 1 and 100; `max_length` is between `t+1` and `100t+100`; `min_length` is between `t + min_speed` and `100t + min_speed`; `i` is assigned the next value from the iterator `iter_i`; `max_speed` is updated based on the calculation.**
