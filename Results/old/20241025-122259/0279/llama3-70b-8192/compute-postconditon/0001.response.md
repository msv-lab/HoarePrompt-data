Example Answer: 
t and d are assigned the values from the input after splitting them. The values of t and d are not determined by the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them.
Output State: **v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them**
