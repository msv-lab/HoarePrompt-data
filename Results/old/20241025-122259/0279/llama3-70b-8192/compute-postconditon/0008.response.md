Example Answer:
The value of `max_speed` is modified by subtracting `d` from it and then taking the maximum of the result and `min_speed`. The values of `max_speed`, `v1`, and `v2` are affected, where `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`. Since the initial values of `v1` and `v2` are between 1 and 100, and `d` is subtracted from `max_speed`, the new value of `max_speed` will also be between 1 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is between 1 and 100; min_speed is between 1 and 100; max_length is between t and 100t; min_length is between t and 100t.
Output State: **v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is between 1 and 100; min_speed is between 1 and 100; max_length is between t and 100t; min_length is between t and 100t**
