Example Answer:
The value of `min_length` is calculated by multiplying `min_speed` and `t`. Since `min_speed` is between 1 and 100 and `t` is assigned a value, `min_length` will be between `t` and `100t`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **v1 and v2 are integers satisfying 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100; t and d are assigned values from the input after splitting them; max_speed is the maximum of v1 and v2; min_speed is between 1 and 100; max_length is between t and 100t; min_length is between t and 100t**
