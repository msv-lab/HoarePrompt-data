Example Answer:
Since the code snippet just returns the string 'YES' without affecting any variables, all the variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, possible_orientations remain unchanged, w2, h2, w3, h3 are updated based on the next values from the iterator, and the function returns 'YES'.
Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, possible_orientations remain unchanged, w2, h2, w3, h3 are updated based on the next values from the iterator, and the function returns 'YES'**
