Postcondition: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, possible_orientations remain unchanged. If w2 + w3 is less than or equal to a1 and the maximum of h2 and h3 is less than or equal to b1, or the maximum of w2 and w3 is less than or equal to a1 and h2 + h3 is less than or equal to b1, then the function returns 'YES'**

Precondition: `num` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if num % 2 == 0:
    return "Even"
else:
    return "Odd"
```

Postcondition for if body: If `num` is divisible by 2 with no remainder, the function returns "Even"
Postcondition for else body: If `num` is not divisible by 2 with no remainder, the function returns "Odd"
Postcondition: **`num` is an integer. If `num` is divisible by 2 with no remainder, the function returns "Even". Otherwise, the function returns "Odd"**
