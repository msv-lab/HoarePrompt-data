Example Answer:
`a2` is assigned the value of the third element of `data` as an integer, and `b2` is assigned the value of the fourth element of `data` as an integer. The values of `a1` and `b1` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a1` is an integer value of the first element of `data`, `b1` is an integer value of the second element of `data`, `a2` is an integer value of the third element of `data`, `b2` is an integer value of the fourth element of `data`.
Output State: **`input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a1` is an integer value of the first element of `data`, `b1` is an integer value of the second element of `data`, `a2` is an integer value of the third element of `data`, `b2` is an integer value of the fourth element of `data`**
