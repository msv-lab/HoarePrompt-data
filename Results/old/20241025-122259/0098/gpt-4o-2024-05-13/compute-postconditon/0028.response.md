Example Answer:
`a3` is assigned the value of the fifth element of `data` converted to an integer, and `b3` is assigned the value of the sixth element of `data` converted to an integer. The previous values of `a3` and `b3` are unknown, so the output state is: `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a1` is an integer value of the first element of `data`, `b1` is an integer value of the second element of `data`, `a2` is an integer value of the third element of `data`, `b2` is an integer value of the fourth element of `data`, `a3` is an integer value of the fifth element of `data`, `b3` is an integer value of the sixth element of `data`.
Output State: **`input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a1` is an integer value of the first element of `data`, `b1` is an integer value of the second element of `data`, `a2` is an integer value of the third element of `data`, `b2` is an integer value of the fourth element of `data`, `a3` is an integer value of the fifth element of `data`, `b3` is an integer value of the sixth element of `data`**
