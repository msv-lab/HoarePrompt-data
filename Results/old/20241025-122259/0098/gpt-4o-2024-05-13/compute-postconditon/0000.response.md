Example Answer:
The list `possible_orientations` is assigned four tuples with different combinations of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3`. The values of `a2`, `b2`, `a3`, `b3` are taken from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; possible_orientations is a list of four tuples with different combinations of a2, b2, a3, b3.
Output State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; possible_orientations is a list of four tuples with different combinations of a2, b2, a3, b3**
