Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3 are integers in the range from 1 to 1000; possible_orientations is a list of four tuples with different combinations of a2, b2, a3, b3**
