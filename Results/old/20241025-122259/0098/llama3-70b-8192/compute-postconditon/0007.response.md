Example Answer: 
The code prints 'NO' but does not affect the initial state or any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are input integers.
Output State: **`a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are input integers**
