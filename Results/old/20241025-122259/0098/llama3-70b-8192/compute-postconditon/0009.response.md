Postcondition: **`a1` and `b1` are integers in the range from 1 to 1000, `a2` and `b2` are input integers, `a3` and `b3` are input integers. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a2` and `b2`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a2` and `b2`, then the program checks the condition for `a1` and `b1` against `a3` and `b3`. If the maximum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the maximum of `a3` and `b3`, and the minimum of `a1` and `b1` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `a3` and `b3`, then 'YES' is printed. If the first condition is not met but the second condition is met, 'YES' is printed. If both conditions fail, 'NO' is printed.**
