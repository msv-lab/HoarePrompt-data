Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if both paintings can be accommodated on the board based on their dimensions. It first compares the dimensions of the first painting with the board, then it compares the dimensions of the second painting with the board. If both paintings can fit within the board boundaries, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". The logic covers all possible scenarios and meets the requirements of the problem description.
