According to the code, the loop can execute again if `num` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 4. Additionally, since the function `func_2` may increase the `count` by 1, we need to consider that possibility. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`count` is 5, `num` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4**
