The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `num`, where `num` is a non-negative integer. 

Case 1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False, covering the cases where `num` is 0 or 1.

Case 2: If `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and is divisible by any number from 2 to int(num), the function returns False.

Case 3: If `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and does not meet the conditions in Case 2, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and return False if `num` is less than 2 or divisible by any number from 2 to int(num), and True otherwise.
