According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `num` and `n`. If `num` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 2, `num` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If `func_2(num)` evaluates to True, then `count` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `num` needs to be incremented by 1 and `func_2(num)` needs to evaluate to True.
State: **`count` is 2, `num` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
