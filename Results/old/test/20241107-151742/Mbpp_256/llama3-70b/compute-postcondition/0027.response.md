Output State: **If n is less than 3, the loop does not execute. If n is greater than or equal to 3, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to n-1, incrementing count by 1 each time func_2(num) evaluates to True. After the loop executes, count contains the number of times func_2(num) returned True, num is n-1, and n is greater than or equal to 3.**
