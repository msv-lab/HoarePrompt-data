According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. If `num` is divisible by 2, then the function returns False. To adjust for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3**
