According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, count is 0, so for the loop to be executed count needs to be adjusted to 1 and num is 2.
State: **`count` is 1, `num` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
