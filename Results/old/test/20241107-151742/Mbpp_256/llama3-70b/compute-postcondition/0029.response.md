The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. 

Case_1: 
Case_2: 
Case_3: 
Case_4: The function calculates the number of times the function `func_2(num)` returns True, where `num` is equal to `n-1`. This calculation is stored in the variable `count`. This case is only applicable when `n` is greater than or equal to 3. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, calculate the number of times `func_2(num)` returns True for `num` equal to `n-1`, and store this count in the variable `count` when `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
