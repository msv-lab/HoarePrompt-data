Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple comparison between the `cost_price` and the `selling_price`. It checks if the two values are equal and returns True if they are equal, and False otherwise. 
Given the problem description, the code meets the requirements as it returns True when there is no profit and no loss, which happens when the cost price is equal to the selling price. Since the code exactly follows the problem description for all cases, the correctness is **True**.
