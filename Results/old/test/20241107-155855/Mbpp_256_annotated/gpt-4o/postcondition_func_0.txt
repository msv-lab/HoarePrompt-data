The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function initializes a list `is_prime` with `n` elements all set to True, updates the list by marking multiples of prime numbers as False, and returns the sum of the updated `is_prime` list. The function accurately handles the case when `n` is less than 2 by returning 0. However, the code does not explicitly handle the case when `n` is a negative integer.
