According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `is_prime` is a list with `n` elements, where the first two elements are set to `False` and the rest are `True`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than or equal to 2, `i` should be 2, and the list `is_prime` should have at least 3 elements with the first two set to `False`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`**
