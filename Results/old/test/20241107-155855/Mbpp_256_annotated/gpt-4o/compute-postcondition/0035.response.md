Output State: 

If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains the same. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, after the loop executes, `is_prime` will have elements updated to `False` for all multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and `is_prime` will have updated elements based on the loop iterations.
