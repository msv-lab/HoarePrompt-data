Example Answer:
A list `is_prime` is created with `n` elements, all initialized to `True`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to `True`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to `True`**
