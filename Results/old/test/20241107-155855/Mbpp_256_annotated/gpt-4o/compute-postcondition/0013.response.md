Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements with the first two elements set to `False` and the rest initialized to `True`. If `n` is less than 4, no changes occur in the `is_prime` list. If `n` is 4 or greater, the loop sets all multiples of 2 as `False` in the `is_prime` list.***
