Example Answer:
Since the code snippet `return True` does not affect any variables in the initial state, the output state remains the same. The function simply returns True without any changes to the initial state.
Output State: **num is at least 2. If num is a perfect square, the loop will check if num is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of num (inclusive). If num is divisible by any i, the function returns False. If num is not divisible by any i, the function does not return anything. If num is less than 2, the function returns False.**
