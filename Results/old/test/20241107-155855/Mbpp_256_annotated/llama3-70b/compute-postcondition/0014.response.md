The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If num is less than 2, the function returns False.

Case_2: If num is at least 2 and not a perfect square, the function does not return anything.

Case_3: If num is at least 2 and a perfect square, the function checks if num is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of num (inclusive). If num is divisible by any i, the function returns False; otherwise, it does not return anything.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number by following the specified criteria.
