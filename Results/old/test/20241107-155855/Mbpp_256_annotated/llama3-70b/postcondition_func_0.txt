The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and counts the number of prime numbers between 2 and n (exclusive) by iterating over the numbers in that range. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and count remains 0. If n is greater than or equal to 2, the loop iterates over numbers from 2 to n-1. For each number in this range, if it is prime, the count is incremented by 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function is accurately described by the annotations.
