Example Answer:
The code checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. If they are equal, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. The values of `cost_price` and `selling_price` are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `cost_price` and `selling_price` are integers.
Output State: **`cost_price` and `selling_price` are integers**
