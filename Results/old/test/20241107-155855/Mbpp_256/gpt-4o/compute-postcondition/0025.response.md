According to the code, the loop will execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. So, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is `i * i` and `j` is less than `n`**
