Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` increments by 1 after each iteration, `j` is `i * i + (k * i)` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False. If `i * i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute.**
