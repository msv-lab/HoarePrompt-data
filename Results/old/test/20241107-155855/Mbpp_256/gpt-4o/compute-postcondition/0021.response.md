According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n + i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + i` which implies adjusting `j` to be `n + i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
