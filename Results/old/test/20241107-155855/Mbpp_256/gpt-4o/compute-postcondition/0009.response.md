According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` is set to False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` needs to be set to False. The value of `i` will increase by 1, and the new value of `j` will be `i * i`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
