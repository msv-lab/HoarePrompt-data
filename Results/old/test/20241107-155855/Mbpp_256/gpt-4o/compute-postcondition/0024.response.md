According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again and `n` should be greater than or equal to 3 * 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is 3**
