Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it correctly returns 0. For other cases, the code initializes a list `is_prime` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify prime numbers up to `n`. It then returns the sum of the `is_prime` list, which represents the number of prime numbers less than `n`. The code also correctly handles cases when `n` is 0 or 1, as it skips those values in the prime number identification process. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming its correctness.
