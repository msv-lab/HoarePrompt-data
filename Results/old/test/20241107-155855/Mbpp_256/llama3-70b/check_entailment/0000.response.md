Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `func_1` function correctly iterates through numbers from 2 to `n-1` and increments the count if the number is prime by calling the `is_prime` function.
- The `is_prime` function correctly identifies prime numbers by checking if the number is divisible by any number in the range `[2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)`.
- Both functions adhere to the problem description and handle all potential cases correctly. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code does not follow the problem requirements.
