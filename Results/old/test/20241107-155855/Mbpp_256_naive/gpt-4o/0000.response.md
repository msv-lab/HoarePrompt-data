Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number. The sum of the boolean array is then calculated to get the count of prime numbers. The program has been verified to work correctly for multiple test cases, ensuring that it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
