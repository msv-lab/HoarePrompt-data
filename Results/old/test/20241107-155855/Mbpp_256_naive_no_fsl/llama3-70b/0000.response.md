Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime or not. It then uses a loop to iterate through numbers from 2 to n-1 and counts how many prime numbers are less than the given non-negative number n. The logic seems correct and handles all potential cases. The `is_prime` function correctly identifies prime numbers and the counting logic in the main function is accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.
