According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `num` and `n`. If `num` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 0 or 1, `num` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `func_2(num)` evaluates to True, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged at 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than the new `num`.
State: **`count` is 0 or 1, `num` is 3, `n` is greater than 3**
