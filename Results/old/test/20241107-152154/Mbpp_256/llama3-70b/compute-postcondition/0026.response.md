According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is either 1 or 2, `num` is 4, and `n` is greater than 3. If `func_2(num)` evaluates to true, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables. To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be adjusted to 4 since the loop starts from 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`count` is either 1 or 2, `num` is 4, `n` is greater than 3**
