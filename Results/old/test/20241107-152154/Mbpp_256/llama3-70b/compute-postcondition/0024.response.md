Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` can be either 0 or 1. The values of `num` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: count is either 1 or 2, `num` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
Output State: **count is either 1 or 2, `num` is 4, `n` is greater than 3**
