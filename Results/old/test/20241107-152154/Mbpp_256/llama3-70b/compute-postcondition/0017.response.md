According to the code, the loop can execute if the range starts from a number greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is greater than 2. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, the count is 0, so to ensure the loop executes, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 2. Additionally, the `num` variable starts from 2, so it would be beneficial to set `num` to 2 as well.
State: **`count` is 0, `num` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
