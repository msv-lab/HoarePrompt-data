The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `num`, where `num` is a non-negative integer. There are three cases for the function's behavior:

Case 1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False.

Case 2: If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function will execute a loop to check if `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and `num`. After the loop executes, `n` remains a non-negative integer, and `num` is not divisible by any number between 2 and `num`.

Case 3: Similar to Case 2, if `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function will execute a loop to check if `num` is divisible by any number between 2 and `num`. After the loop executes, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `num` is not divisible by any number between 2 and `num`, and the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and return False if `num` is less than 2, or True if after the loop executes, `num` is not divisible by any number between 2 and `num`.
