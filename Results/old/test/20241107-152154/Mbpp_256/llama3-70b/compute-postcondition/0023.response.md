According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num` and `n`. If `num` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. Since the loop starts from 2, `num` needs to be adjusted to 4 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`count` is either 0 or 1, `num` is 4, `n` is greater than 3**
