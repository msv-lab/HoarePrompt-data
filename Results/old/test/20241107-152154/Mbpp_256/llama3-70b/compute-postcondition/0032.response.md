Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraint that `num` is a non-negative integer. The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns False if `num` is less than 2, True if `num` is not divisible by any number between 2 and `num`. `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`, iterates over the range [2, n), calls `func_2(num)` for each number, increments a count variable if `func_2(num)` is True, and returns the final count value. The functionality of `func` includes four possible cases denoted by `C`, based on the value of `n`. **
