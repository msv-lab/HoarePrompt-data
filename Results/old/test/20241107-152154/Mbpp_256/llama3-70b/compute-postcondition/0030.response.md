Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and iterates over the range [2, n). For each number `num`, it calls the function `func_2(num)` to determine if `num` is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `num`. If `func_2(num)` evaluates to True, the count variable is incremented. The function then returns the total count of numbers within the range [2, n) for which `func_2(num)` is True. If `n` is 2 or lower, the loop does not execute, and the count remains 0.**
