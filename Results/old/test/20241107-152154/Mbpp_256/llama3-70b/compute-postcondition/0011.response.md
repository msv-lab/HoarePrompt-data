According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is not divisible by 2, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5 to satisfy the range condition.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is not divisible by 2, `i` is 5**
