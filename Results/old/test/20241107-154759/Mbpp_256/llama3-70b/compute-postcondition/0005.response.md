According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by `i`, the loop will exit early and return False. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. To execute one more time, the next `i` needs to be checked. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next `i` to be checked should be the current `i` + 1. Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2**
