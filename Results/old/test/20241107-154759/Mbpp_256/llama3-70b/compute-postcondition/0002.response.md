According to the code, the loop can execute if `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. The loop range starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of `num` rounded up to the nearest integer. Since the loop starts from 2, the only state that needs adjusting is `num` should be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2**
