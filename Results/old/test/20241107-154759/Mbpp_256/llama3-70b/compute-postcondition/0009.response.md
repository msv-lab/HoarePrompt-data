Example Answer:
The function returns `False`, and the state of the variables `num` and `i` remains the same as they are not affected by the return statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and the function returns False.
Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and the function returns False**
