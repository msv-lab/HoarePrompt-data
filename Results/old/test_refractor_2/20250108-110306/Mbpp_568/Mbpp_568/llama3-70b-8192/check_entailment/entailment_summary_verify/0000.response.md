Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries for any non-negative integer `n`. The output hints confirm that the function initializes a list of length `n` where each element is an empty dictionary `{}`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the output hints that would indicate any issues with the provided code. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
