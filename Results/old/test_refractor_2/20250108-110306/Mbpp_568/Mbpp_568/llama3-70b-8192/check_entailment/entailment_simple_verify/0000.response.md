Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries, where `n` is a non-negative integer. The original assessment correctly states that the function works for any positive integer `n`, and the annotation supports this by specifying that `n` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program meets the problem description.
