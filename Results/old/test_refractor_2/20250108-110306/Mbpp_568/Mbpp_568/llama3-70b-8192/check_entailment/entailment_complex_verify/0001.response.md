Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1(n)` correctly creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries for any non-negative integer `n`. The annotations clearly state that the function initializes a list of length `n` where each element is an empty dictionary, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities that would invalidate the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
