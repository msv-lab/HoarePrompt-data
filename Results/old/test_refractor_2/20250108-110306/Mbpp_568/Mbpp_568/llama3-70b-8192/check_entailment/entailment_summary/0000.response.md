Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list containing `n` empty dictionaries. The code uses a list comprehension to create this list, which is a correct and efficient way to achieve the desired result. Since the problem description asks for a function that creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries and the provided code meets this requirement for any valid non-negative integer input, the function is correct.
