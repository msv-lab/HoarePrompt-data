Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer, and returns a list containing `n` empty dictionaries. 

- The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of `n` empty dictionaries.
- For each iteration in the range from `0` to `n-1`, it adds an empty dictionary `{}` to the list.
- If `n` is `0`, the list will be empty as there are no iterations in the range, which aligns with the requirement to create a list of `n` empty dictionaries.
- If `n` is a positive integer, the function will correctly generate a list of `n` empty dictionaries.

Since the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs (non-negative integers), it is correct according to the problem description.
