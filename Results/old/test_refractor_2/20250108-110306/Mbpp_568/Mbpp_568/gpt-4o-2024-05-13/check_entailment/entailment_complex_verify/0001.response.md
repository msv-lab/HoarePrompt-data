Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries as required. The annotated version clarifies that the function accepts a non-negative integer `N` and returns a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The provided test cases confirm the function's behavior for inputs 5, 6, and 7. Since the function works consistently for these cases and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the annotated version, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
