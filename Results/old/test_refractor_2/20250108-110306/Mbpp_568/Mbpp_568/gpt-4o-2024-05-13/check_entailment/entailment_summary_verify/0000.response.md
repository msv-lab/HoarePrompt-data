Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of creating a list of `N` empty dictionaries. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a non-negative integer `N` and returning a list of exactly `N` empty dictionaries. The function uses a list comprehension to generate the desired list, which is a correct and efficient approach. Since the function passes the provided assertions and there are no logical errors or missing functionalities, the program is correct according to the problem description and the output hints.
