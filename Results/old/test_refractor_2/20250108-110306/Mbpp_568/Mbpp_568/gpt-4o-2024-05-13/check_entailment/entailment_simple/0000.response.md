Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `N` as input and returns a list containing `N` empty dictionaries. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for different values of `N`. Specifically:

- When `N` is 5, the function returns a list with 5 empty dictionaries.
- When `N` is 6, the function returns a list with 6 empty dictionaries.
- When `N` is 7, the function returns a list with 7 empty dictionaries.

The program uses a list comprehension to generate a list of `N` empty dictionaries, which correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
