Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), \( a \), and \( b \) from standard input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Floor and Block Calculation**: The program accurately calculates the floor and block numbers for both \( a \) and \( b \):
   - \( a\_floor = (a - 1) \% m + 1 \)
   - \( a\_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 \)
   - Similar calculations are done for \( b\_floor \) and \( b\_block \).

3. **Horizontal Movement Time Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the minimum time to move horizontally (between blocks) using:
   - \( min\_block\_time = min(abs(a\_block - b\_block), n - abs(a\_block - b\_block)) * 15 \)

4. **Vertical Movement Time Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the minimum time to move vertically (between floors) using:
   - If \( a\_floor > b\_floor \): \( min\_floor\_time = (a\_floor - b\_floor) * 5 + 10 \)
   - If \( a\_floor <= b\_floor \): \( min\_floor\_time = (b\_floor - a\_floor) * 5 + 10 \)

5. **Total Time Calculation**: The program correctly sums the horizontal and vertical movement times to get the total time:
   - `print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)`

6. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately by considering the relative positions of \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of both floors and blocks. It ensures that the minimum time is calculated correctly regardless of whether \( a \) and \( b \) are in the same block but different floors or in the same floor but different blocks.

Given that the program follows the logic described in the problem statement without any discrepancies, it can be concluded that the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
