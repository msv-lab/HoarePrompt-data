Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Calculation of `min_floor_time`:**
   - The formula for `min_floor_time` is incorrect. According to the problem description, moving from one floor to another can be done using either the stairs or the elevator. The provided code calculates the time to move between floors using the stairs only, which is not always the most efficient way. The correct approach should consider both the stairs and the elevator.

2. **Handling of elevator usage:**
   - The problem description specifies that the elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor to travel. However, the current implementation does not account for these times correctly. Specifically, the calculation of `min_floor_time` does not include the time for the elevator ride.

3. **Calculation of `min_block_time`:**
   - The current logic for `min_block_time` only considers the time to walk around the building to reach the target block. It does not account for the time taken to use the elevator within the target block, which is an important factor in minimizing the total travel time.

Here is a more accurate approach to solve the problem:
- Calculate the optimal path considering both stairs and elevator for both floor and block transitions.
- Consider all possible paths and choose the one with the minimum time.

Below is an updated version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    def distance(a, b):
        # Distance between two blocks
        return min(abs(a - b), n - abs(a - b))
    
    def time_to_move_blocks(a_block, b_block):
        # Time to move blocks using stairs or elevator
        return min(distance(a_block, b_block) * 15, (distance(a_block, b_block) - 1) * 15)
    
    def time_to_move_floors(a_floor, b_floor, target_block):
        # Time to move floors using stairs or elevator
        if a_floor < b_floor:
            return (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + (a_floor == 1 and target_block == b_block) * 10
        else:
            return (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + (b_floor == 1 and target_block == a_block) * 10
    
    a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    a_floor = (a - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1
    b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    b_floor = (b - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1
    
    # Find the minimum time to reach the target block
    min_block_time = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        min_block_time = min(min_block_time, time_to_move_blocks(i, b_block) + time_to_move_floors(a_floor, b_floor, i))
    
    print(min_block_time)
```

This approach ensures that both the block transition and the floor transition are considered optimally, taking into account both the stairs and the elevator.
