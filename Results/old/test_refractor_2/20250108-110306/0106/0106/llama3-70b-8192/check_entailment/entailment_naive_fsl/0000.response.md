Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Specifically, the calculation of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` does not fully consider all possible scenarios, particularly when the apartments are in different blocks but on similar floors or when the apartments are in the same block but on different floors.

For example, let's consider the following scenario:
- Input: `4 10 5`
- `a = 200`
- `b = 205`

In this case, both apartments are on the 10th floor but in different blocks. The program calculates the time to move between blocks and the time to move between floors, but it does not account for the fact that moving from the 10th floor of one block to the 10th floor of another block involves a significant time cost (15 seconds to move between blocks plus the time to take the lift and walk to the desired floor).

The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum time is simply the sum of the time to move between blocks and the time to move between floors, without considering the optimal path which might involve taking the lift within the same block to minimize the overall time.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the optimal path for both block transitions and floor transitions, potentially involving the use of the lift within the same block to minimize the time spent.
