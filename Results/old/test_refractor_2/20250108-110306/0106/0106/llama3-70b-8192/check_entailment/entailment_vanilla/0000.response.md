Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the scenario where both the starting and ending floors are the same but the blocks are different. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum time to move between blocks using `min_block_time` but does not properly account for the possibility of moving through multiple floors within the same block.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 10 5
100 105
```

In this case, both Edward and Natasha are on the 10th floor, but in different blocks (100 -> 1st block, 105 -> 2nd block). The program will incorrectly calculate the time as if they were on different floors, which is not correct according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where the floors are the same but the blocks are different more carefully. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    
    a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
    a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
    b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    
    # Calculate the time to move between blocks
    min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
    
    # Calculate the time to move between floors
    if a_floor == b_floor:
        min_floor_time = 0
    elif a_floor > b_floor:
        min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5
    else:
        min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5
    
    # Add the time for the lift travel
    lift_travel_time = 10 + abs(a_block - b_block)
    
    print(min_block_time + min_floor_time + lift_travel_time)


```

This version correctly handles the case where the starting and ending floors are the same but the blocks are different, ensuring the program works as expected for all potential cases.
