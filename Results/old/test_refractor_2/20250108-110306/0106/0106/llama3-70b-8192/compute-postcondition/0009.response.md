Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a_floor` = (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` = (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` = max(0, (abs(a_block - b_block) - 1) * 15, (n - abs(a_block - b_block) - 1) * 15)**

Explanation: Since the program does not enter the if block where the condition `(a_floor > b_floor)` is true, it must be the case that `(a_floor <= b_floor)`. Therefore, we update the `min_block_time` calculation to reflect this new condition. The original formula for `min_block_time` needs to be adjusted to consider the scenario where `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`.
