The code does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, or `a_floor`. It only assigns a new value to `b_floor` using the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of `b_floor` being calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer and a â‰  b, `a_floor` = (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` = (b - 1) % m + 1**
