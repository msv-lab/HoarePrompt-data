The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`, which is an integer representing the apartment number. The function also considers positive integers `m` and `k` representing the number of floors in each block and the number of apartments on each floor, respectively, although these are not provided as parameters in the function definition.

After executing the function body, the function calculates the `block` number using the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, the `floor_within_block` using `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, and the `floor` within the block using `floor_within_block // k + 1`. Finally, the function returns the calculated `block` and `floor`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the block and floor numbers based on the given formulas.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, and returns the block and floor numbers based on the provided formulas.**
