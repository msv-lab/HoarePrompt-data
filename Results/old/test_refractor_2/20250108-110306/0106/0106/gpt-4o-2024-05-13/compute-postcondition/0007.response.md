The code calculates `direct_walk_time` based on the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n`, multiplied by 15. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, or `time_to_exit`. The value of `direct_walk_time` is updated, but its specific value depends on the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\); `a` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq n*m*k\) and \(a \neq b\); `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are the return values of the functions `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)` respectively; if `floor_a == 1`, `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is `9 + floor_a`; `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.**
