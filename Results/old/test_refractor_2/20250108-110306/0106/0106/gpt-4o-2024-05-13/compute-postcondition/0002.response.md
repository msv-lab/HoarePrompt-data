The code assigns the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1` to `floor`. Given the initial state, the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The values of `block` and `floor_within_block` are derived from `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.

- `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
- `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.

The code does not change these values but calculates `floor` based on `floor_within_block`. Since `floor_within_block` is the remainder when `apartment - 1` is divided by `m * k`, dividing `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1 gives the floor number within the block.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number; `m` is a positive integer representing the number of floors in each block; `k` is a positive integer representing the number of apartments on each floor; `block` is the calculated block number based on the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k); `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`.**
