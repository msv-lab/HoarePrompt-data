Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code functionality. The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. 

- The `get_location` function accurately calculates the block and floor numbers based on the apartment number, covering edge cases like when the apartment number is 1 or exceeds the total number of apartments.
- The main function `func_1` correctly accounts for the time to exit the current apartment, the time to walk around the circular building to the correct apartment block, the time to use the lift to reach the target floor, and sums these times to find the minimum total time.

The output hints further confirm that the program handles all necessary calculations and edge cases correctly, aligning with the problem description and requirements. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
