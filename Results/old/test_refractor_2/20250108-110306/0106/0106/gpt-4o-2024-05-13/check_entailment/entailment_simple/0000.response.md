Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key aspects:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the inputs for the number of blocks (`n`), floors per block (`m`), apartments per floor (`k`), and the apartment numbers of Edvard (`a`) and Natasha (`b`). This part adheres to the problem description.

2. **Location Calculation**:
   - The `get_location` function correctly calculates the block and floor for any given apartment number. This function respects the circular nature of the building and ensures that the location is correctly determined within the constraints.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The main logic in `func_1` calculates the time required for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. It considers:
     - Time to exit the current block (if needed).
     - Time to walk around the building using the shortest path.
     - Time to go up or down the stairs to the target floor.
   - The calculations are performed in a manner consistent with the problem description, ensuring that all possible movements are considered and the minimum time is chosen.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where Edvard and Natasha might be in the same block or on the same floor, or they might be in different blocks but on the same floor, or even on different floors within the same block.
   - The program correctly accounts for the use of the elevator and walking between blocks, which are essential parts of the solution.

Given that the program correctly parses the inputs, accurately calculates the required times, and considers all necessary movements as described in the problem statement, it is concluded that the program is correct.
