Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function `get_location`**: This function correctly maps an apartment number to its corresponding block and floor numbers. It handles edge cases such as when the apartment number is 1, and it works correctly even if the apartment number exceeds the total number of apartments available.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the minimum time required for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. It considers all necessary components:
   - `time_to_exit`: Correctly handles whether Edvard starts from the ground floor or a higher floor.
   - `min_walk_time`: Correctly calculates the minimum time to walk between blocks, considering both direct and reverse paths.
   - `time_to_target_floor`: Correctly calculates the time to walk down to the target floor.

Given these points, the code appears to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios that the code is not handling correctly based on the provided information. Therefore, the correctness is True.
