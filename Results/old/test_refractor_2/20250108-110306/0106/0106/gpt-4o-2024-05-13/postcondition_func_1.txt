The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` which represents the apartment number and returns the corresponding block and floor numbers. The block number is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `m` is the number of floors in each block and `k` is the number of apartments on each floor. The floor number within the block is determined by `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, and the final floor number is given by `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The function covers the case when `apartment` is a valid positive integer and handles edge cases such as when `apartment` is 1, which would result in `block` being 1 and `floor` being 1. If `apartment` exceeds the total number of apartments available (`m * k`), the function still correctly calculates the block and floor based on the provided formulas.
