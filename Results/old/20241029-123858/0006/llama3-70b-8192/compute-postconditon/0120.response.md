`di` and `hi` are assigned the values of two integers obtained from an input that is split into two parts and converted to integers. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `_` is an input integer; `a` and `b` are integers; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` is an empty list; `h` is an empty list; `di` and `hi` are input integers split from input.
Output State: **`_` is an input integer; `a` and `b` are integers; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` is an empty list; `h` is an empty list; `di` and `hi` are input integers split from input**
