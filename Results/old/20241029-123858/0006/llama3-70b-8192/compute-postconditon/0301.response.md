The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` and `n` are integers. If `n` < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If `n` == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1. `x` is greater than 0 and `x` is decreased by `min(di, x)`. If `x` is greater than 0, `x` is further increased by `hi`. `ans` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
