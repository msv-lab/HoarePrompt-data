Precondition: `x`, `y` are integers
Program fragment:
```
if x % 2 == 0:
    y = x // 2
else:
    y = x * 3 + 1

```
Postcondition for if body: If `x` is even, `y` is set to `x` divided by 2.
Postcondition for else body: If `x` is odd, `y` is set to `x` multiplied by 3 plus 1.
Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers. If `x` is even, `y` is set to `x` divided by 2. If `x` is odd, `y` is set to `x` multiplied by 3 plus 1.**
