`x` is incremented by the value of `hi`. The previous value of `x` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `di` and the original positive integer `x`, and `y` is an integer. However, the value of `hi` is not known, so we can't determine the exact new value of `x`. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is increased by the value of `hi`, and `y` is an integer.

Output State: **`x` is increased by the value of `hi`, and `y` is an integer**
