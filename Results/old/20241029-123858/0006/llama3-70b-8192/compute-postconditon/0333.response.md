The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: If `x` was initially positive, `x` will be less than or equal to 0, and `ans` will be the number of iterations the loop executed. If `x` was initially 0 or less, `x` will remain the same, and `ans` will be 0. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
