The `break` statement causes the loop or the current control structure (such as a `while` or `for` loop, or a `switch` case) to be terminated and control to be transferred to the statement immediately following the loop or control structure.

Given that the state is unknown, it means we do not have information about the variables or the specific loop/control structure the `break` statement is inside.

Output State: **we break out of the most internal loop or control structure.**
