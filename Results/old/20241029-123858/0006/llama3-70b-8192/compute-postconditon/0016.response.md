Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` is assigned the value of `n` incremented by 2; `n` is less than -2; `x` is an input integer; `d` contains `di` with the new `di` appended; `h` contains the list with `hi` appended twice; `di` and `hi` are input integers reassigned with new input values**
