To determine if the loop can execute one more time, the condition `x > 0` must hold true. Given that `x` is a positive integer at the end of the previous iteration, it already satisfies this condition. Therefore, the loop can indeed execute one more time. 

No changes need to be made to the program state for the loop to proceed, as `x` is already a positive integer, ensuring that `x > 0`.

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `y` is an integer**
