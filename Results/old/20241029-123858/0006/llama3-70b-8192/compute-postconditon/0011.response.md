`di` and `hi` are re-assigned with the values obtained from the input, which are split and converted to integers. The previous values of `di` and `hi` are replaced with the new input values. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` is assigned the value of `n` incremented by 1; `n` is less than -1; `x` is an input integer; `d` contains `di`; `h` contains the list with `hi` appended; `di` and `hi` are input integers re-assigned with new input values**
