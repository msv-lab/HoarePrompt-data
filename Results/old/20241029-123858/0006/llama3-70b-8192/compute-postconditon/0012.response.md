d` is a list that contains `di`, and `di` is an input integer re-assigned with a new input value. The code appends the value of `di` to the list `d`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` is assigned the value of `n` incremented by 1; `n` is less than -1; `x` is an input integer; `d` contains `di` with the new `di` appended; `h` contains the list with `hi` appended; `di` and `hi` are input integers re-assigned with new input values.
