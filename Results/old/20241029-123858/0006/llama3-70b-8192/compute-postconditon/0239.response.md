`di` and `hi` are assigned values from an input split into two integers. Thus, the output state is `di` and `hi` are input integers, and the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **If `x` is positive, -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is printed. `_` is `n` increased by 4, incremented by 1, and is less than 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` is less than -5, `x` is an input integer, `d` is a list containing `di`, `h` contains `hi`, `ans` is the number of iterations executed before `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 or the iterator is exhausted, `iterator` is exhausted or advanced by the number of pairs fetched, `di` and `hi` are input integers.**
