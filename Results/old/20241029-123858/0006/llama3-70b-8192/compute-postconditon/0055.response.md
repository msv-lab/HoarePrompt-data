Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the value after being decreased by `min(di, x)`; `d` is sorted in reverse order; `h` remains an empty list; `ans` is the count of how many times the loop executed; `iterator` is an iterator of zipped `d` and `h`; `di` and `hi` are the next values from the iterator.**
