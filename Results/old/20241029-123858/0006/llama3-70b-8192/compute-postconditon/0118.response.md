`h` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `_` is less than -1; `a` and `b` are integers; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` is an empty list; `h` is an empty list.

Output State: **`_` is less than -1; `a` and `b` are integers; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` is an empty list; `h` is an empty list**
