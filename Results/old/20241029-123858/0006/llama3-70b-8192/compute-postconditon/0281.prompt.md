You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one more time, please simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students is 3 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, students is 3 less than its initial value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 3 less than its initial value and students currently is greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: If `_` (which is `n` increased by 4) is less than 0 initially, `d` and `h` contain pairs of `di` and `hi` collected from input until `_` becomes 0 or greater, incrementing `_` by 1 each iteration. If `_` is not less than 0 initially: `d` and `h` remain empty, `_` remains `n` increased by 4, `ans` is incremented by the number of successful iterations where `x` remains positive, `iterator` is an iterator over pairs of `d` and `h`, `di` and `hi` are the next input integers from the iterator, `d` is sorted in descending order, `h` is sorted in ascending order, `x` is decreased by the minimum of `di` and `x` in each iteration, increased by `hi` if still positive, and the loop terminates when `x` is less than or equal to 0. If `x` is initially 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, `ans` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If a `StopIteration` exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
```
while True:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
