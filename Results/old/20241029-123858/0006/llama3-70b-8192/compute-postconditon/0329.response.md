`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)`. If `x` was greater than 0 after the decrement, `x` is further incremented by `hi`, resulting in `x` being (x - min(di, x)) + hi. If `x` was less than or equal to 0 after the decrement, `x` remains as (x - min(di, x)). `ans` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
