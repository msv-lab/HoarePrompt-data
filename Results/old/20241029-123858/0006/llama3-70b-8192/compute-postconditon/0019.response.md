The value of `_` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `_` is `n + 2`, where `n` is less than -2. Therefore, `_` is now `(n + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n + 3`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` is `n` + 3; `n` is less than -2; `x` is an input integer; `d` contains `di` with the new `di` appended; `h` contains the list with `hi` appended twice and another `hi` appended; `di` and `hi` are input integers reassigned with new input values; `d` now has the new `di` appended**
