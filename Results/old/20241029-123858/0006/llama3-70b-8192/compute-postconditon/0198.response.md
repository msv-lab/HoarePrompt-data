`x` is increased by the value of `hi`. Since `hi` is the next value from the `iterator` assigned to `hi`, the exact value of `hi` is unknown. The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **_ is an input integer increased by 3, `a` and `b` are integers, `n` and `x` are input integers with `x` greater than 0, `d` contains the first, second, and third input integers `di`, `di`, `di` sorted in descending order, `h` contains the first, second, and third input integers `hi`, `hi`, `hi` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the number of iterations executed, `iterator` is an iterator of pairs from `d` and `h` with more elements available, `di`, `hi` are the next values from `iterator` assigned to `di` and `hi` respectively, `x` is decreased by the minimum of `di` and the original `x`, `x` is increased by the next value from `iterator` assigned to `hi`.**
