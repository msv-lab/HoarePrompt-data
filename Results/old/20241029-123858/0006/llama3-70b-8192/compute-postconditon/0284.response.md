`x` is increased by `hi`. Since the initial state indicates that `x` has been decreased by the minimum of `di` and `x`, the exact value of `x` is unknown. However, the increase by `hi` will affect `x`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`x` is increased by `hi`, other variables remain unaffected**
