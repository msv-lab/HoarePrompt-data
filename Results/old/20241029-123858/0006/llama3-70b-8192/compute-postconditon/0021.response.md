Based on the provided details of the initial state and the loop's operation, let's determine the final output state.

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` is assigned the value of `n`; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` is an empty list; `h` is an empty list
```
while _ < 0:
    di, hi = map(int, input().split())
    d.append(di)
    h.append(hi)
    _ += 1
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop only executes while `_` is less than 0.
   - This means the loop will not run if `n` (and thus `_`) is 0 or positive.

2. **Iteration Details:**
   - For each iteration, `di` and `hi` are collected as inputs and appended to lists `d` and `h` respectively.
   - The value of `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 0 or positive, the loop will not execute at all.
   - If `n` is negative, the loop will execute until `_` reaches 0.

### Output State Determination:

- **If `n` is 0 or positive:**
  - The loop will not execute.
  - `d` and `h` will remain empty.
  - `_` remains equal to `n`.

- **If `n` is negative:**
  - The loop will execute `-n` times (since `_` will increment from `n` to 0).
  - `d` and `h` will contain `-n` elements, each populated by the respective inputs for `di` and `hi`.
  - `_` will be incremented from `n` to 0.

### Output State:
**If `n` is 0 or positive, the loop will not execute, and the output state will be: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` remains equal to `n`; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` remains an empty list; `h` remains an empty list.**

**If `n` is negative, the loop will execute `-n` times, and the output state will be: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `_` is 0; `n` and `x` are input integers; `d` contains `-n` elements, each `di` collected from inputs; `h` contains `-n` elements, each `hi` collected from inputs.**
