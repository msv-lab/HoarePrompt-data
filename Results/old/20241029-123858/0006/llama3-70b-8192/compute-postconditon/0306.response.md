**Precondition:** `x` is an integer, `y` is zero.
**Program fragment:**
```python
if x > 0:
    if x > 10:
        y = x * 2
    else:
        y = x + 5
```
**Postcondition for if body:** `x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
**Postcondition for else body:** there is no else part in the code
**Postcondition:** **`x` is an integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 10, then `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 10, then `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `y` remains zero.**
