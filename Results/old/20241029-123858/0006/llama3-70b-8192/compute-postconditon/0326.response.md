`x` is incremented by `hi`. The previous value of `x` is decremented by `min(di, x)`. Therefore, the new value of `x` is `(x - min(di, x)) + hi`. The exact values of `x`, `di`, and `hi` are not provided, so the output state should reflect this calculation.

Output State: **`x` is (x - min(di, x)) + hi**
