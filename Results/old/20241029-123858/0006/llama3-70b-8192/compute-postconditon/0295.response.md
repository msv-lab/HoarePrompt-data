Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    n = -n
    m += 1
elif n == 0:
    return m
else:
    n -= 13
    m += 1
```
Postcondition for if body: the integer `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1.
Postcondition for else body: If integer `n` is 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` has been decreased by 13 and integer `m` is increased by 1.
Postcondition: **`m` and `n` are integers. If `n` < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If `n` == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.**
