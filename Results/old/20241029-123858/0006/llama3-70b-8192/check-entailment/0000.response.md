Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not consider the optimal way to choose blows to minimize the number of heads grown back. Let's break down why the approach is incorrect with an example.

Consider the following input:
```
1
2 10
5 10
6 3
```
According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. Initially, Zmei has 10 heads.
2. We have two types of blows:
   - Blow 1: Decreases heads by 5 and then increases by 10.
   - Blow 2: Decreases heads by 6 and then increases by 3.

The current code sorts the list of blows based on the damage (`d`) in descending order and the heads grown (`h`) in ascending order. This approach can lead to suboptimal results. 

Let's apply the code's logic:
1. It will choose the blow with the highest damage first, which is Blow 2 (6 damage, 3 heads grown).
2. After the first blow, heads will be reduced from 10 to 4 (i.e., `10 - 6`), but then 3 heads will grow back, resulting in 7 heads left.
3. The next iteration will again choose Blow 2, reducing heads from 7 to 1 (`7 - 6`), but then 3 heads will grow back, resulting in 4 heads left.
4. The next iteration will again choose Blow 2, reducing heads from 4 to 0 (`4 - 6`), and Zmei is defeated.

So the program will output `3` blows to defeat Zmei, but let's see if this is optimal:
1. Blow 1: Decreases heads by 5 but then increases by 10, which seems counterproductive here.
2. Blow 2: As analyzed above, it takes 3 blows.

However, another correct approach may identify that using Blow 1 twice (even though it seems counterintuitive due to the massive regrowth) and then Blow 2 can be optimal, or vice versa. The current program does not explore these combinations optimally.

Thus, the example shows that the current approach does not always find the minimum number of blows due to its naive sorting and selection strategy.

Therefore, the program is **False** as it does not guarantee the minimum number of blows for all inputs.
