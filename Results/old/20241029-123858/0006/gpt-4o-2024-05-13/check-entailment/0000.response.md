Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program fails to address several edge cases accurately. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. The program does not handle the case where the initial number of heads `x` is already zero. In such a case, the output should immediately be `0` since no blows are needed.

2. The condition `if d >= x:` checks if a single blow can defeat Zmei Gorynich. However, it does not consider the possibility that a blow might grow heads and then another blow might defeat Zmei. For example, if `x = 10, d = 9, h = 1`, the monster grows heads and is never defeated.

3. The logic to calculate `additional_blows` as `(remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow` assumes that the maximum effective blow (i.e., `d - h`) will always be the best choice. However, there could be situations where combining different types of blows would be more efficient.

4. The program does not handle cases where `max_effective_blow <= 0` correctly. In cases where all blows result in more heads growing than being cut off, Zmei Gorynich cannot be defeated, and the output should be `-1`.

To illustrate some issues, consider the following example:

Input:
```
1
2 10
3 5
5 10
```
Here, `x = 10`, `d1 = 3, h1 = 5`, and `d2 = 5, h2 = 10`. The program would calculate `max_single_blow = 5` and `max_effective_blow = 0` (since `d2 - h2 = 5 - 10 = -5`). Since `max_effective_blow <= 0`, the program outputs `-1`. However, the correct answer should be `-1` since every blow results in more heads.

In summary, the program does not cover all edge cases and special scenarios, and thus it is incorrect.
