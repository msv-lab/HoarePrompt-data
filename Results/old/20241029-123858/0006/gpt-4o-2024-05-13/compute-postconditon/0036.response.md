The program could raise a `StopIteration` exception when calling `next(iterator)` if the `iterator` has no more elements to iterate over. This would cause the program to break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If there is no exception, the program proceeds to check the conditions and update the `results`, `max_single_blow`, and `max_effective_blow` accordingly.

Therefore:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9, `results` is the original list with 1 appended if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`, `d` and `h` are the first `d_i` and `h_i` values from `iterator`, `max_single_blow` is the maximum value between the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`. If `d` is greater than `h`, then `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`. If the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
