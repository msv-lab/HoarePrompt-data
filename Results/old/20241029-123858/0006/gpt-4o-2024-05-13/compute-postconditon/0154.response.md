To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the states provided at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while _ < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute again, the variable `_` must be less than 0. 

The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
- If `_` is initially 0 or greater, `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is 3, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1.
- If `_` is initially negative (`-_` is k), `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is 3 + 2k, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` contains k tuples of `(d, h)` from `data`, `_` is incremented to 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `_` accordingly.

Let's consider the two cases:

1. **If `_` is initially 0 or greater**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. If `_` is initially 0 or greater, `_` becomes positive or remains positive, which means the loop will not execute again because `_` is not less than 0.
   - So, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to modify `_` to be less than 0.

2. **If `_` is initially negative (`-_` is k)**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is incremented to 0. If `_` is initially negative, `_` becomes 0, which means the loop will not execute again because `_` is not less than 0.
   - So, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to modify `_` to be less than 0.

Since we need to ensure `_` is less than 0 for the loop to execute again, we adjust `_` to be any negative value.

State: **`_` is less than 0, `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is `[((n, x), blows)]`, `results` is a list, `index` is 3, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is an empty list**
