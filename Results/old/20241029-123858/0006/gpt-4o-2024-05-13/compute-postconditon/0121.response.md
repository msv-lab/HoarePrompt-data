To determine whether the `while True` loop can execute one more time, we need to review the conditions under which this loop might terminate:

1. **Immediate Break on Condition**: The loop breaks immediately if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`. This suggests that if such a `d` was found, the loop would have broken, and the state would need to be adjusted to prevent this break.

2. **StopIteration**: The loop will break if `StopIteration` is raised when calling `next(iterator)`.

Given the final state of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.
- `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`.
- `results` contains either 1, -1, or a calculated value based on conditions mentioned.
- `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` are being updated based on the conditions in the loop.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time:

1. **Maintain `t` and `queries`**: The values of `t` and `queries` should remain within the given constraints.
2. **Adjust `results`**: Ensure that `results` is in a state that doesn't indicate completion of all necessary calculations.
3. **Prevent Immediate Break**: Ensure that no `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`. This means we need to adjust `queries` so that none of the `d` values in the next iteration satisfy `d >= x`.
4. **Handle StopIteration**: Ensure that the iterator has more elements to process.

Given these considerations, the necessary state adjustments would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples where no `d` in the next set of tuples is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` contains values that do not indicate completion of all necessary calculations, `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` are set such that they do not trigger immediate termination**
