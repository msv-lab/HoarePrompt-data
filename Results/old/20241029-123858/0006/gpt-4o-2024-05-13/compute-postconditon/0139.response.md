`_` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `_` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `_` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 5, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is a list containing a tuple with the values `(d, h)`, `d` is `int(data[3])`, `h` is `int(data[4])`, variable `_` is increased by 1**
