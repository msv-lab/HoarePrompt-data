You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function's functionality.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective.

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your summary here **
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example 1:

Annotated Code:
```
# This is a function and its postcondition is: The function accepts a parameter `number`, returns True if `number` is even; otherwise, it returns False.
def func(number):
    # This is an if statement and its postcondition is: If `number` is even, the function returns True.
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # This is a return statement in the if part and its postcondition is: Returns True if `number` is even.
        return True
    # This is an else statement and its postcondition is: If `number` is not even, the function returns False.
    else:
        # This is a return statement in the else part and its postcondition is: Returns False if `number` is not even.
        return False
```

Return Postconditions: The function accepts a parameter `number` and returns True if `number` is even; otherwise, it returns False.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and what does it return? What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic. Make sure to adhere to the format Functionality: ** Your summary here **

Example Answer 1:

The function func accepts an integer parameter number. According to the annotations, if number is even, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to check whether number is even and return True if it is, or False if it is odd.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer number and returns True if it is even and False if it is odd. **

#This is the summary for the whole function and its postcondition is : The function accepts a dictionary `data`, returns `'Key not found'` if the key `'value'` is missing. If the value is not comparable, returns `'Invalid data type'`. If the value is greater than 10, returns `'High'`; otherwise, returns `'Low'`.
def func(data):
    #This is a summary of the whole try-except block and its total postcondition is : `data` is a dictionary that may contain a key `'value'` mapped to a comparable value. If the key `'value'` is not found, the function returns `'Key not found'`. If the value associated with `'value'` cannot be compared with an integer, the function returns `'Invalid data type'`. If the key exists and the value is comparable, the function returns `'High'` if the value is greater than 10, otherwise it returns `'Low'`.
    #This is the try block and its postcondition is : `data` is a dictionary that may contain a key 'value' mapped to a comparable value, and `val` is the value associated with the key 'value' in `data`. If `val` is greater than 10, the function returns 'High'. Otherwise, the function returns 'Low'.
    try:
        #This is simple command in try block and its postcondition is : `data` is a dictionary that may contain a key 'value' mapped to a comparable value, `val` is the value associated with the key 'value' in `data`
        val = data['value']
        #This is a summary of the whole if-else block and its total postcondition is : `data` is a dictionary that may contain a key 'value' mapped to a comparable value, and `val` is the value associated with the key 'value' in `data`.

        if (val > 10) :
            #This is return statement in if part and its postcondition is : `data` is a dictionary that may contain a key 'value' mapped to a comparable value, `val` is the value associated with the key 'value' in `data`, and the function returns 'High'
            return 'High'

        return 'Invalid data type'
```

Return Postconditions: `data` is a dictionary that may contain a key `'value'` mapped to a comparable value. If the key `'value'` is not found, the function returns `'Key not found'`. If the value associated with `'value'` cannot be compared with an integer, the function returns `'Invalid data type'`. If the key exists and the value is comparable, the function returns `'High'` if the value is greater than 10, otherwise it returns `'Low'`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and what does it return? What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic. Make sure to adhere to the format Functionality: ** Your summary here **

Example Answer 2:  
The function func accepts a single parameter data, which should be a dictionary containing a key 'value' with an integer value. It then attempt to access data['value'] and checks if it is greater than 10. If yes, the function returns 'High'.If no,  the function returns 'Low'. By using exceptions if 'value' key is missing the function returns 'Key not found' and if value is not the correct type for the dictionary key , it returns 'Invalid data type'.
Functionality: The function accepts a dictionary data and returns 'High' if data['value'] is greater than 10, 'Low' if data['value'] is 10 or less, 'Key not found' if the key 'value' is absent, and 'Invalid data type' if a type error occurs.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a dictionary data and returns 'High' if data['value'] is greater than 10, 'Low' if data['value'] is 10 or less, 'Key not found' if the key 'value' is absent, and 'Invalid data type' if a type error occurs.**



Example 3:

```
#This is the summary for the whole function and its postcondition is : The function accepts a parameter students, calculates the sum of all  integers up to the initial value of students. If the total amount exceeds 100, it returns 'not enough money'. If a ZeroDivisionError occurs due to trying to divide total by students, it returns 'Division by zero error'.
def func(students):
    #This is simple command and its postcondition is : `students` is an integer, `total` is 0
    total = 0
    #This is a summary of the total loop and its postcondition is : `students` is 0, `total` is the sum of all integers up to the initial value of `students`.
    while students >= 1:
        total += students
        students -= 1
        # In the following comments we are unrolling the loop 3 times to help you understand its functionality
        #This is the summary of unrolled_loop_1 and its total postcondition is : `students` is one less than the initial value, `total` is the same as `students`
        #This is the summary of unrolled_loop_2 and its total postcondition is : `students` is equal to the initial value, `total` is 2 more than the initial value of `students`
        #This is the summary of unrolled_loop_3 and its total postcondition is : `students` is one less than the initial value, `total` is 3 times the new value of `students`
    #This is a summary of the  whole if block and its total postcondition is : `students` is 0, `total` is the sum of all integers up to the initial value of `students`. If the total amount exceeds 100, the function returns 'not enough money'.
    #This is the if part of the statement and its postcondition is : `students` is 0, `total` is the sum of all integers up to the initial value of `students`
    if (total > 100) :
        #This is return statement in if part and its postcondition is : `students` is 0, `total` is the sum of all integers up to the initial value of `students`
        return 'not enough money'
    #This is a summary of the whole try-except block and its total postcondition is : A `ZeroDivisionError` could occur when trying to divide `total` by `students` since `students` is 0. In this case, the function will return 'Division by zero error'. Therefore, the output state is: **`students` is 0, `total` is 0. If the division by zero error occurs, the function returns 'Division by zero error'.**
    #This is the try block and its postcondition is : `students` is 0, `total` is 0, and an error occurred during the calculation of `cost_per_student`
    try:
        #This is simple command in try block and its postcondition is : `students` is 0, `total` is 0, and an error occurs during the calculation of `cost_per_student`

    except (ZeroDivisionError):
        #This is return statement in except block_1 and its postcondition is : The function returns 'Division by zero error'
        return 'Division by zero error'

```

Return Postconditions: 
Case_1: `students` is 0, `total` is the sum of all integers up to the initial value of `students`. If the total amount exceeds 100, the function returns 'not enough money'.

Case_2: A `ZeroDivisionError` could occur when trying to divide `total` by `students` since `students` is 0. In this case, the function will return 'Division by zero error'. Therefore, the output state is: **`students` is 0, `total` is 0. If the division by zero error occurs, the function returns 'Division by zero error'.**

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and what does it return? What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic. Make sure to Adhere to the format Functionality: ** Your summary here **

Example Answer 3: The function func accepts an integer n and calculates the sum of integers from n down to 0. It then checks if the sum exceeds 100 and returns 'not enough resources' in that case. Since n is 0 at the end of the loop there is always a division by zero error, and it returns 'Division by zero error'. The functionality of the function is to calculate the sum of integers from n to 0, return 'not enough resources' if the sum is bigger than 100 and an 'Division by 0' error otherwise.


Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, calculates the sum of integers from `n` to 0, and returns 'not enough resources' if the sum exceeds 100, or 'Division by zero error' otherwise **

Example 4:
Annotated Code:
```
#This is the summary for the whole function and its postcondition is : The function accepts a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, calculates the index of the middle element, and returns the middle element.
def func(numbers):
    #This is simple command and its postcondition is : numbers list is sorted in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    #This is simple command and its postcondition is : numbers list is sorted in ascending order, `mid` is the index of the middle element in the list
    mid = len(numbers) // 2
    #This is return statement and its postcondition is : numbers list is sorted in ascending order, `mid` is the index of the middle element in the list, and the function returns the middle element
    return numbers[mid]
```
Return Postconditions: numbers list is sorted in ascending order, `mid` is the index of the middle element in the list, and the function returns the middle element

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and what does it return? What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic. Make sure to adhere to the format Functionality: ** Your summary here **

Example Answer 4:
The function func accepts a list of integers and sorts the list in ascending order. It then calculates the index of the middle element and returns that element. But if the function has an even number of elements at index mid, but the median should be the average of the two middle elements. Also if the list is empty an out ob bounds error will occur. The functionality of the function is to find and return the middle element of the sorted list of integers but if the number of elemnts is even it returns one of the middle elements instead of their average and if the list is empty an error occurs.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, sorts it in ascending order, and returns the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, it returns one of the middle elements. If the list is empty an error occurs **

    max_value = 0
    #This is simple command and its postcondition is : `numbers` is a list of integers, `max_value` is 0, `iterator` is an iterator object for `numbers`
    iterator = iter(numbers)
    #This is a summary of the total loop and its postcondition is : `numbers` is a list of integers, `max_value` is either the maximum value in the list or 0. If any `num` in the list is greater than `max_value`, `max_value` is updated to `num`. If a `StopIteration` exception is raised, the program breaks out of the loop.
    while True:
        try:
            num = next(iterator)
            if num > max_value:

    #This is return statement and its postcondition is : `numbers` is a list of integers, `max_value` is either the maximum value in the list or 0
    return max_value
```
Return Postconditions: numbers` is a list of integers, `max_value` is either the maximum value in the list or 0

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and what does it return? What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic. Make sure to Adhere to the format Functionality: ** Your summary here **

Example Answer 5:
The function func accepts a list of integers and finds the maximum value in the list. It initializes max_value to 0 and iterates over the list to find the maximum value. If no number in the list is greater than 0 so if all the numbers are negative the function returns 0. The functionality of the function is to return the maximum value in the list. The function does not handle the case where the list is empty, which could be a potential edge case. And also if all the numbers are negative the function returns 0 which is not the maximum value in the list.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and returns the maximum value in the list. If all the numbers are negative, it returns 0 instead of the maximum **

#This is the summary for the whole function and its postcondition is : The function accepts an integer `t` and a list `queries` of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, and then returns `results`.

    #This is a summary of the total loop and its postcondition is : `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9. `results` is a list that contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in the list `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0. `iterator` is an iterator over the list `queries`, and will be exhausted after processing all queries. `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d` for each `d` in `blows`. `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d - h` if `d > h` for each `(d, h)` in `blows`. If `d >= x` for any `(d, h)` in `blows`, the inner loop breaks and appends 1 to `results`.

If `StopIteration` is raised during `query = next(iterator)`, the outer loop breaks. Edge cases include when `queries` is empty, in which case `results` remains an empty list, and when all `d` values in `blows` are less than `x` and `max_effective_blow` is non-positive, leading to `-1` being appended to `results`.
