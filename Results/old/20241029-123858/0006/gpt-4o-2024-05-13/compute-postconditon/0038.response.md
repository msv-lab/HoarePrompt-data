Based on the provided initial state and understanding the loop's behavior through the examples given, let's determine the output state of the loop.

### Loop executes 1 time:
**Initial State:** `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `queries`, `query` is the next tuple from `iterator`, `n` is the first element of `query[0]`, `x` is the second element of `query[0]`, `blows` is the list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)` from `query`, `max_single_blow` is 0, `max_effective_blow` is float('-inf'), `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`.

**Loop Execution:** 
```python
while True:
    try:
        d, h = next(iterator)
        if d >= x:
            results.append(1)
            break
        max_single_blow = max(max_single_blow, d)
        if d > h:
            max_effective_blow = max(max_effective_blow, d - h)
    except StopIteration:
        break
else:
    if max_effective_blow <= 0:
        results.append(-1)
    else:
        remaining_heads = x - max_single_blow
        additional_blows = (remaining_heads + max_effective_blow - 1) // max_effective_blow
        results.append(additional_blows + 1)
```

**Output State:** After 1 iteration, if `d >= x` for the first `d` value, `results` contains 1, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `d`, and `max_effective_blow` is updated if `d > h`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the loop exits, and based on the conditions, `results` may contain -1 or some calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow`.

### Loop executes 2 times:
**Initial State:** Same as above after one iteration.

**Loop Execution:** Same as above for the second `d` and `h` values.

**Output State:** After 2 iterations, if `d >= x` for any `d` value in the first two iterations, `results` contains 1, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d`, and `max_effective_blow` is updated if `d > h`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the loop exits, and based on the conditions, `results` may contain -1 or some calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow`.

### Loop executes 3 times:
**Initial State:** Same as above after two iterations.

**Loop Execution:** Same as above for the third `d` and `h` values.

**Output State:** After 3 iterations, if `d >= x` for any `d` value in the first three iterations, `results` contains 1, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `d`, and `max_effective_blow` is updated if `d > h`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the loop exits, and based on the conditions, `results` may contain -1 or some calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow`.

### General Output State:
**Output State:** `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9. `results` is a list that contains 1 if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple in `blows`, otherwise `results` contains -1 if `max_effective_blow <= 0`, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow`. `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the loop exits. `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d`, and `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d - h` if `d > h`. If `d >= x`, the loop breaks and appends 1 to `results`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **If `d >= x` in the first iteration:** The loop breaks immediately, and `results` contains 1.
2. **If no `d >= x` and `max_effective_blow <= 0`:** The loop completes all iterations and appends -1 to `results`.
3. **If `max_effective_blow > 0` and loop completes:** `results` contains a value calculated based on `x`, `max_single_blow`, and `max_effective_blow`.
4. **If `n` is 0:** The loop does not start, and `results` remains empty.
