Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`. If any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` has 1 appended to it and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.**
