A `StopIteration` might be triggered by the `next(iterator)` function call. This exception occurs when there are no more items in the iterator to return. If `next(iterator)` raises a `StopIteration`, the program will break out of the loop. Otherwise, the program processes the values of `d` and `h` to update the states of `results`, `max_single_blow`, and `max_effective_blow`.

Therefore:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`. `results` contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0. `max_single_blow` is updated to `max(max_single_blow, d)`. If `d > h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to `max(max_effective_blow, d - h)`. If the iterator is exhausted (raising `StopIteration`), the loop breaks.**
