Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

The loop condition is `while _ < 0:` which means the loop will execute as long as the value of `_` is less than 0.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`
- `queries` is an empty list
- `results` is a list
- `index` is 9
- `n` is `int(data[1])`
- `x` is `int(data[2])`
- `blows` is a list containing a tuple with the values `(d, h)`, another tuple with the values `(d, h)`, and an additional tuple with the values `(d, h)`
- `d` is `int(data[7])`
- `h` is `int(data[8])`
- variable `_` was less than -1 before increment
- `_` is incremented by 1

Given that `_` was less than -1 before increment and was incremented by 1, we can infer the following:
- Before increment: `_ < -1`
- After increment: `_` is now `_ + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `_ < 0` must hold true. Since `_` was less than -1 before increment, incrementing it by 1 would still keep it less than 0.

Therefore, no further adjustment to the state of `_` is needed for the loop to execute one more time. The rest of the state variables do not affect the loop's condition directly.

State: **`t` is an integer converted from `data[0]`, `queries` is an empty list, `results` is a list, `index` is 9, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `blows` is a list containing a tuple with the values `(d, h)`, another tuple with the values `(d, h)`, and an additional tuple with the values `(d, h)`, `d` is `int(data[7])`, `h` is `int(data[8])`, variable `_` was less than -1 before increment, `_` is incremented by 1**
