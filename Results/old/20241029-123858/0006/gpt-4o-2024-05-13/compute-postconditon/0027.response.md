Given that the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will theoretically continue to execute indefinitely unless a break condition or an exception (such as `StopIteration`) is met. Since the prompt does not specify that any break condition or `StopIteration` has occurred, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's break down and repeat the program state:

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9
- `results` is a list that may contain 1 if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple
- `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the program breaks out of the loop.
- During the loop, if `d >= x`, 1 is appended to `results` and the loop is broken. Otherwise, `max_single_blow` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `d`, and if `d > h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `d - h`.

Since the loop is `while True`, we assume the conditions that would break the loop (such as `StopIteration` or a break statement) have not occurred.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9, `results` is a list that may contain 1 if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`**
