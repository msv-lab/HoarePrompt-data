Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, `results` is a list that contains 1 if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple in `blows`, otherwise `results` contains -1 if `max_effective_blow <= 0`, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow`, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows` with more elements to process, `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `d - h` if `d > h`, `query` is the next element from `iterator`**
