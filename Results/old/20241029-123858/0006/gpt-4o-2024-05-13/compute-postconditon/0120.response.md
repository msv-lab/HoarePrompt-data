At which point in the program could such an exception occur? The `StopIteration` exception could occur when calling `next(iterator)` if the iterator has been exhausted. This could happen in two places: first, when `query = next(iterator)` is called, and second, when `d, h = next(iterator)` is called within the nested `try` block.

What is the program's state after the `try` statement is executed? 

1. **If no `StopIteration` exception is raised at `query = next(iterator)`**:
    - The program proceeds to extract `n` and `x` from `query[0]`.
    - Initializes `max_single_blow` to 0 and `max_effective_blow` to negative infinity.
    - Enters the `while True` loop, iterating over `blows`.

2. **Within the `while True` loop**:
   - If `d >= x`, the function appends 1 to `results` and breaks the loop.
   - Updates `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` appropriately.
   - If the iterator is exhausted (raising `StopIteration`), the loop breaks, and if no `d` was found that meets the condition `d >= x`, the function appends -1 to `results` or calculates the necessary additional blows to reach `x` and appends to `results`.

3. **If `StopIteration` is raised at `query = next(iterator)`**:
   - The outer `try` block catches the exception, and the loop breaks.

Therefore, after considering the program state through all possible paths and handling the exceptions, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`. `results` contains either 1 if any `d` from the tuples in `blows` is greater than or equal to `x`, or -1 if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow` if `d >= x` is not satisfied and `max_effective_blow` is greater than 0. If `d` is greater than or equal to `x`, `results` is appended with 1 and the loop breaks. `max_single_blow` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `d`. If `d` is greater than `h`, `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `d - h`. If the iterator is exhausted (raising `StopIteration`), the loop breaks. After the loop, if no `d` was found such that `d >= x`, and if `max_effective_blow` is less than or equal to 0, `results` is appended with -1. Otherwise, the necessary additional blows to reach `x` are calculated and appended to `results`. If `StopIteration` is raised during `query = next(iterator)`, the loop breaks.**
