Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, `results` is a list that contains 1 if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple in `blows`, otherwise `results` contains -1 if `max_effective_blow <= 0`, or a calculated value based on `max_single_blow` and `max_effective_blow`, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`, `max_single_blow` is 0, `max_effective_blow` is float('-inf'), `query` is the next element from `iterator`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `query[0]`, `x` is the second element of the tuple `query[0]`, `blows` is assigned the value `query[1:]`, `d` and `h` are the first and second elements of the next tuple from the iterator over `blows`**.
