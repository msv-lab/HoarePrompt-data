According to the program state and the `while True` loop, the loop is designed to execute indefinitely unless certain conditions or exceptions stop its execution. Since it's a `while True` loop, it will always attempt to execute the next iteration unless it encounters a `break` statement or an exception like `StopIteration`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the main factor that could stop the loop's execution is the `StopIteration` exception from the `iterator`. For the loop to be able to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the `iterator` has not yet exhausted all items. Therefore, we need to ensure that there are still items left in the `iterator`.

Letâ€™s summarize the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`
- `results` is the original list with 1 appended if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple
- `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`
- `d` and `h` are the first `d_i` and `h_i` values from `iterator`
- `max_single_blow` is the maximum value between the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`
- If `d` is greater than `h`, then `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`

For the loop to proceed to the next iteration, we need to ensure that the `iterator` still has elements to iterate over, which means it should not raise the `StopIteration` exception.

Therefore, the state should ensure that the `iterator` has not been exhausted. We can repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration since the `while True` loop ensures that it can execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `queries` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing a tuple `(n, x)` and a list of `n` tuples `(d_i, h_i)`, where `n`, `d_i`, `h_i` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `d_i`, `h_i` <= 10^9, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^9, `results` is the original list with 1 appended if `d >= x` is satisfied for any tuple, `iterator` is an iterator over the list `blows`, `d` and `h` are the first `d_i` and `h_i` values from `iterator`, `max_single_blow` is the maximum value between the previous `max_single_blow` and `d`, If `d` is greater than `h`, then `max_effective_blow` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_effective_blow` and `d - h`**
