Precondition: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` and `z` are integers.
Program fragment:
```
if x == 0:
    y += 1
    z -= 1
elif x > 0 and x <= 5:
    y -= 1
    z += 2
else:
    y = 0
    z = 0

```
Postcondition for if body: If `x` is 0, `y` is incremented by 1 and `z` is decremented by 1.
Postcondition for else body: If `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5, `y` is decremented by 1 and `z` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `y` is set to 0 and `z` is set to 0.
Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` and `z` are integers. If `x` is 0, `y` is incremented by 1 and `z` is decremented by 1. If `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5, `y` is decremented by 1 and `z` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `y` is set to 0 and `z` is set to 0.**
