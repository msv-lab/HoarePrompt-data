According to the provided `while True` loop statement, the loop will always execute, as it is an infinite loop by definition. Therefore, the program state at the end of the previous iteration does not need any adjustment to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. The state can simply be repeated.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 1, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is a new iterator created from `friends`, `j` is less than `m`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`**
