The `break` statement will cause the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since the initial state of variables is unknown and the `break` statement does not alter the values of any variables directly, the output state will simply indicate that a `break` has occurred.

Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
