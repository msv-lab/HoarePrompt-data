Given that the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it inherently does not have a condition to check before deciding whether to execute. This means that the loop can always execute another iteration unless there is an explicit `break` or `return` statement within the loop body that could terminate the loop.

Since we are instructed to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration for a `while True` loop, the state remains the same.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 2, `pleased` is incremented by 1 if `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `max_pleased`, `min_price`, and `ans` are conditionally updated based on the loop logic, `j` is less than `m`, `iterator` is an iterator object created from `friends`, `f` is the next item from `iterator`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement.**
