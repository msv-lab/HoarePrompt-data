According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than 0 after being increased by 1. This implies that `_` should have been at most -1 before it was incremented. 

No other states need to be adjusted as the loop execution only depends on `_`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains one set created from the slice `f_i[1:]`, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from input, variable `_` is at most -1 and is increased by 1**
