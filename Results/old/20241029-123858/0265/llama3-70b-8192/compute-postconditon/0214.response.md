Precondition: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is either 0, 1, or 2, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`.
Program fragment:
```
if f.issubset(pizzas[i][1]) or f.issubset(pizzas[j][1]):
    pleased += 1

```
Postcondition for if body: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is either 1, 2, or 3, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`.
Postcondition for else body: there is no else part in the code
Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`. If `f` is a subset of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is increased by 1 and becomes either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, the value of `pleased` remains unchanged and is either 0, 1, or 2.**
