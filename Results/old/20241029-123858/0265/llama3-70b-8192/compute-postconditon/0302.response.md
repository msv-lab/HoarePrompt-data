Since the `while` loop is `while True`, it is designed to run indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of within the loop body. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any states to ensure that the loop can execute again. We simply repeat the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 2, `pleased` is incremented by 1 if `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `max_pleased`, `min_price`, and `ans` are conditionally updated based on the loop logic, `j` is less than `m`, `iterator` is an iterator object created from `friends`, `f` is the next item from `iterator`. If `StopIteration` is raised, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement.**
