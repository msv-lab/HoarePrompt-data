According to the given code, the `while` loop is `while True`, which means it will always attempt to execute the next iteration regardless of any conditions. Therefore, there is no need to modify the program state to ensure that the loop can execute again.

In this case, the state at the end of the previous iteration can simply be repeated.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is an iterator created from `friends`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`**
