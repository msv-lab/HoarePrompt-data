Output State: **If `_` is initially less than 0, the loop will execute until `_` is no longer less than 0. After the loop finishes, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains sets created from the slices `f_i[1:]` of the input lines, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from the final input, and `_` is `m`. If `_` is initially 0 or greater, the loop will not execute, and the initial state will remain unchanged. `pizzas` is [(c_j, a_jt)], `c_j` is an input integer, `r_j` is an input integer, `a_jt` is an input set of integers from the second element onward. `_` is incremented by 1.**
