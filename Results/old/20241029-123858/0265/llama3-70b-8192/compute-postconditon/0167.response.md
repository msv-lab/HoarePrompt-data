pleased is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than -1, `j` is less than or equal to 0, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, `f` is the last element successfully retrieved from the iterator (if any), `pleased` is 0, `m` is greater than 0.
