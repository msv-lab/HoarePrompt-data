`pleased` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `pleased` is 0, so the new value of `pleased` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than -1, `j` is less than or equal to 0, `iterator` is reset to a new iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from `iterator`, `pleased` is 1, `m` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than or equal to 0, `iterator` is reset to a new iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from `iterator`, `pleased` is 1, `m` is greater than 0**
