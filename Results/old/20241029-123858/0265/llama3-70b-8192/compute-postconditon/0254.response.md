max_pleased is assigned the value of pleased. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is equal to the count of items in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `iterator` is exhausted, `max_pleased` is equal to `pleased`.
