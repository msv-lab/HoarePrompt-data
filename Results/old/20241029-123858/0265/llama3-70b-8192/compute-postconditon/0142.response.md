A `StopIteration` exception might be triggered at `f = next(iterator)` if the `iterator` has no more elements to yield. If the exception is raised, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `f` is a subset of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, the variable `pleased` is increased by 1.

Therefore:

Output State: **`max_pleased`, `min_price`, and `ans` reflect the best found values according to the criteria during the iterations, `i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `iterator` is an iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from the iterator. If `f` is a subset of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is increased by 1. If the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
