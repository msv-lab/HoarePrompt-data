Postcondition: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 2, `pleased` is incremented by 1 if `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`. `max_pleased`, `min_price`, and `ans` are conditionally updated based on the loop logic, `j` is less than `m`, `iterator` is an iterator object created from `friends`, `f` is the next item from `iterator` or the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement if `StopIteration` is raised.**
