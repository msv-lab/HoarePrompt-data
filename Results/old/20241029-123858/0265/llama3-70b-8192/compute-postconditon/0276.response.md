A `StopIteration` exception can be raised when calling `next(iterator)` if there are no more items in the `iterator`.

If the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

If no exception occurs, the program continues with the following logic:
- Retrieve the next value from `iterator` and store it in `f`.
- Check if `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`. 
- If the condition is true, increment `pleased` by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is incremented by 1, `pleased` is 0 or 1, `iterator` is a new iterator created from `friends`, `j` is less than `m`, `f` is the next value from `iterator`. If `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, then `pleased` is incremented by 1. If `StopIteration` is raised, the state is unknown and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
