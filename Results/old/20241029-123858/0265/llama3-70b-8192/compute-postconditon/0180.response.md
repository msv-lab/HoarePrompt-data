Since the `while` loop statement is `while True`, it means that the loop will execute indefinitely unless there is an explicit break condition inside the loop body. Therefore, as per the instructions, we simply need to repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than or equal to 0, `iterator` is reset to a new iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from `iterator`, `pleased` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `m` is greater than 0**
