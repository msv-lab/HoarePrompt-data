`friends` is an empty list, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from input. The code appends a set created from the slice `f_i[1:]` to the `friends` list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains one set created from the slice `f_i[1:]`, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from input**
