According to the given problem statement, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `_`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than 0. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is less than -1. This condition guarantees that the loop can execute again because `_` being less than -1 is certainly less than 0.

Let's summarize the given states:
- If `_` is initially less than 0, the loop will execute until `_` is no longer less than 0.
- After the loop finishes, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5.
- `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5.
- `friends` contains sets created from the slices `f_i[1:]` of the input lines.
- `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from the final input.
- `_` is less than -1.
- If `_` is initially 0 or greater, the loop will not execute, and the initial state will remain unchanged.
- `pizzas` is [(c_j, a_jt)] plus the new tuple `(c_j, a_jt)`, where `c_j` is an input integer, `r_j` is an input integer, and `a_jt` is an input set of integers from the second element onward.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

Given that `_` is already less than -1, the loop can certainly execute one more time without any modifications needed to the program state.
