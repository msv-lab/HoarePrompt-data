`ans` is assigned the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given that `i` is less than -1 and `j` is less than 0, `i + 1` is less than 0 and `j + 1` is less than 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is equal to the count of items in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `iterator` is exhausted, `max_pleased` is equal to `pleased`, `min_price` is assigned the value `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`, `ans` is a tuple where the first element is less than 0 and the second element is less than 1**
