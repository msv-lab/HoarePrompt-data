Output State: **If `_` is initially less than 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer where 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains sets created from the slices `f_i[1:]` of the input lines, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from the final input, `pizzas` contains tuples `(c_j, a_jt)` for each iteration of the loop, and `_` is incremented to 0. If `_` is initially 0 or greater, the initial state remains unchanged, `ans` is (-1, -1), `max_pleased` is 0, `min_price` is `float('inf')`, `i` is equal to `m`. After the loop finishes, `print(*ans)` outputs the values of `ans`.**
