Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `iterator` is exhausted. If `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` and `ans` is updated to `(i + 1, j + 1)`.**

Now, let's proceed to your task. 

Precondition: `a` is an integer, `b` is a non-negative integer
Program fragment:
```
if a > b:
    a = a - b
else:
    b = b - a

```
Postcondition for if body: `a` is decremented by the value of `b`
Postcondition for else body: `b` is decremented by the value of `a`
Postcondition: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a non-negative integer. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is decremented by `b`. Otherwise, `b` is decremented by `a`.**
