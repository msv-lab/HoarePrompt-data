According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must still be less than 0 after being increased by 1. Therefore, before the increment, `i` must have been less than -1. 

State: **`i` is less than -1**
