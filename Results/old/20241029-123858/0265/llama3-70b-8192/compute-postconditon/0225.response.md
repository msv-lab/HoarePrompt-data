Precondition: `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `z` is an integer, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, and `iterator` is exhausted. If `friends` is empty, `pleased` is 0. `max_pleased` is an integer, `min_price` is an integer, `ans` is a tuple, and `pizzas` is a list of tuple pairs where the first element is the price and the second element is a list of ingredients.

Program fragment:
```
if pleased == max_pleased:
    if pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0] < min_price:
        min_price = pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]
        ans = i + 1, j + 1

```

Postcondition for if body: If `pleased` equals `max_pleased` and the sum of the prices of pizzas `i` and `j` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to the sum of the prices of pizzas `i` and `j`, and `ans` is updated to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If the sum of the prices is not less than `min_price`, no changes are made.

Postcondition for else body: There is no else part in the code.

Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `pleased` is the count of elements in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, and `iterator` is exhausted. If `friends` is empty, `pleased` is 0. `max_pleased` is an integer, `min_price` is an integer, `ans` is a tuple, and `pizzas` is a list of tuple pairs where the first element is the price and the second element is a list of ingredients. If `pleased` equals `max_pleased` and the sum of the prices of pizzas `i` and `j` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to the sum of the prices of pizzas `i` and `j`, and `ans` is updated to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. If the sum of the prices is not less than `min_price`, no changes are made.**
