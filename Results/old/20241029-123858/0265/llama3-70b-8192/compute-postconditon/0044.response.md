The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or conditional statement directly. Since the initial state is unknown and no variables are mentioned, the specific values of variables remain unknown. The output state is that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. 

Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
