According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. The loop will execute if `_` is less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be less than 0.

Thus, we need to adjust the state so that `_` is less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains one set created from the slice `f_i[1:]` and has been appended with another set created from the slice `f_i[1:]`, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from input, variable `_` is less than 0**
