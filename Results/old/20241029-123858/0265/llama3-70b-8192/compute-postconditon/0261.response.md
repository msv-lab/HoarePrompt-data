Postcondition: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than 0, `pleased` is equal to the count of items in `friends` that are subsets of either `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, `iterator` is exhausted. If `pleased` is greater than `max_pleased`, then `max_pleased` is updated to `pleased`, `min_price` is set to the sum of `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]`, and `ans` becomes the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` where the first element is less than 0 and the second element is less than 1. If `pleased` equals `max_pleased` and `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` is less than `min_price`, then `min_price` is updated to the sum of `pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0]` and `ans` is set to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` where the first element is less than 0 and the second element is less than 1. If `pleased` does not equal `max_pleased` and `pleased` is less than `max_pleased`, `min_price` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
