Given the `while True` loop, it is an infinite loop, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The program state can remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is less than -1, `j` is less than or equal to 0, `iterator` is reset to a new iterator of `friends`, `f` is the next element from `iterator`, `pleased` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `f` is a subset of `pizzas[i][1]` or `pizzas[j][1]`, and `m` is greater than 0**
