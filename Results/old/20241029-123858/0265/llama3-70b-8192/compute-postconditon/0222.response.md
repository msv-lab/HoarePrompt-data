min_price is assigned the sum of pizzas[i][0] and pizzas[j][0]. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: x is a non-negative integer, y is an integer, z is an integer, j is less than m, pleased is the count of elements in friends that are subsets of either pizzas[i][1] or pizzas[j][1], and iterator is exhausted, min_price is pizzas[i][0] + pizzas[j][0].
