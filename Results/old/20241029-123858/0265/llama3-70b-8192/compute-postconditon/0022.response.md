To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while _ < 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The current state is:
- If `_` is initially less than 0, the loop will execute until `_` is no longer less than 0.
- After the loop finishes, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5.
- `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5.
- `friends` contains sets created from the slices `f_i[1:]` of the input lines.
- `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from the final input.
- `_` is `m`.
- If `_` is initially 0 or greater, the loop will not execute, and the initial state will remain unchanged.
- `pizzas` is [(c_j, a_jt)], `c_j` is an input integer, `r_j` is an input integer, `a_jt` is an input set of integers from the second element onward.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `_ < 0` must be satisfied. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. To make sure the loop can execute again, `_` needs to be adjusted such that it is still less than 0 after being incremented by 1.

Let's break it down:
1. If `_` is incremented by 1, then it means for the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than -1 before the increment in the current state.
2. We need to adjust `_` so that `_ < 0` is satisfied even after the increment.

So, we need `_` to be less than -1 at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **If `_` is initially less than 0, the loop will execute until `_` is no longer less than 0. After the loop finishes, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains sets created from the slices `f_i[1:]` of the input lines, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from the final input, and `_` is less than -1. If `_` is initially 0 or greater, the loop will not execute, and the initial state will remain unchanged. `pizzas` is [(c_j, a_jt)], `c_j` is an input integer, `r_j` is an input integer, `a_jt` is an input set of integers from the second element onward. `_` is incremented by 1.**
