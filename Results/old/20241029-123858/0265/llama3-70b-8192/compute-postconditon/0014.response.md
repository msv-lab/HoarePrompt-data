At the end of the previous iteration, the state includes the following:

- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5
- `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5
- `friends` contains two sets created from the slice `f_i[1:]`
- `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from input
- variable `_` is incremented by 1 and was initially less than 0

The `while` loop condition is `_ < 0`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than 0.

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check the value of `_` after the last iteration. Since `_` was initially less than 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, for the loop to continue `_` must remain less than 0.

If `_` was initially less than 0 and incremented by 1 after the last iteration, `_` must still be less than 0 to ensure that the loop can execute again. 

Thus, if `_` was initially less than -1, it would still be less than 0 after being incremented by 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `_` is still less than 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `m` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, `friends` contains two sets created from the slice `f_i[1:]`, `f_i` is a list of integers obtained from input, variable `_` is less than 0**
