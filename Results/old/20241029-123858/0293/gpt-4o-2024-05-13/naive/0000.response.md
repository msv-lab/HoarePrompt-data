RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The code attempts to find pairs of \(n\) and \(m\) such that the total number of distinct squares in the \(n \times m\) table equals \(x\). However, the algorithm for calculating the total number of squares is incorrect. Specifically, the expression \((n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)\) used to calculate the number of squares is not correct. The correct approach should involve calculating the sum of squares of all possible sizes within the \(n \times m\) table. For example, for a given table \(n \times m\), the total number of squares can be computed using:

\[
\text{total\_squares} = \sum_{k=1}^{\min(n, m)} (n-k+1) \times (m-k+1)
\]

where \(k\) is the side length of the square. This formula needs to be implemented to correctly find the pairs \((n, m)\).
