`results.append((n, m))` appends a tuple containing the values of `n` and `m` to the `results` list. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by 2 * (n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1), `n` is less than `x`, `m` is increased by 2, and `(n, m)` is appended to `results`**
