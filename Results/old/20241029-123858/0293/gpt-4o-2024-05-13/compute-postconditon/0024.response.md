To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` statement:

```
while n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute again, the condition `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be true.

### Current State Analysis
The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- If `total_squares` reaches `x`, `results` will contain the tuple `(n, m)` and the loop will terminate.
- If `total_squares` exceeds `x` without equaling `x`, the loop will terminate without modifying `results`.
- After the loop, `m` is incremented to a value where `total_squares` exceeds `x`.
- If `x` is sufficiently large and no suitable `(n, m)` pair exists, the loop will continue until `total_squares > x`.
- `n` is incremented by 1.

### Required State Adjustment
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be met. Therefore, we need to ensure that the value of `n` is such that `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is true.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. Determine the maximum value of `n` for which the loop can still execute:
   - The loop will continue as long as `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Therefore, ensure that `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. We do not need to modify any other states explicitly since the condition for the loop to continue depends solely on `n`.

### State Update
Given the above analysis, we ensure that `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **If total_squares reaches x, results will contain the tuple (n, m) and the loop will terminate. If total_squares exceeds x without equaling x, the loop will terminate without modifying results. After the loop, m is incremented to a value where total_squares exceeds x. If x is sufficiently large and no suitable (n, m) pair exists, the loop will continue until total_squares > x; n is incremented by 1, and n is less than int(x ** 0.5) + 1.**
