The function `func` accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^{18}\). It tries to find pairs of integers \((n, m)\) such that the sum of squares formula equals `x`. If such pairs are found, they are stored in the list `results`. The function returns `True` if any pairs are found; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

However, it does not handle all edge cases appropriately. Here are the potential issues:

1. **Empty `results` Handling:** The function does not explicitly return `True` or `False` based on the contents of `results`.
2. **Invalid `x` Values:** If `x` is less than 1 or greater than \(10^{18}\), the function does not handle these edge cases explicitly.
3. **Edge Cases for Large `x`:** The function could potentially run for very large values of `x`, leading to performance issues.
4. **Unnecessary Loop Unrolling:** The nested loops with redundant unrolling comments add complexity without adding functionality.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18) and attempts to find pairs of integers \((n, m)\) such that a specific sum of squares equals `x`. It stores these pairs in a list and prints the number of pairs found and the pairs themselves. The function does not handle cases where `x` is less than 1 or greater than \(10^{18}\) explicitly, and it does not return `True` or `False` based on the existence of such pairs. Additionally, it may face performance issues for very large values of `x`.**
