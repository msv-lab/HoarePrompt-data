A `StopIteration` exception might be triggered at `n, m = next(iterator)` if the `iterator` has no more values to yield. If the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the loop or the code block containing the `try` statement will be broken out of. Otherwise, `n` and `m` will be updated to the next values from `iterator`, and `n` and `m` will be printed.

Therefore: 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and `iterator` has more values to yield. If `iterator` has no more values to yield, the loop or code block containing the `try` statement is broken out of, otherwise `n` and `m` are updated and printed.**
