The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_squares` is less than `x` and is increased by `(n - m + 1) * (m - n + 1)`, `n` is less than `x`, `m` is increased by 1, `results` has the tuple `(n, m)` appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
