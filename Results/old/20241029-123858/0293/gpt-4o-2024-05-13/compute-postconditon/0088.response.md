The given `while True` loop will always attempt to execute another iteration unless it encounters a break or an exception that halts its execution. In this case, the program state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator` and that `iterator` has more values to yield.

Since this is a `while True` loop, it inherently will continue to execute indefinitely. The key factor here is whether `iterator` has more values to yield. If it does, the loop will attempt to retrieve and process the next values.

Let's analyze the provided state step-by-step:

- `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`: This suggests that `n` and `m` have been updated with the latest values from the iterator during the last iteration.
- `iterator` has more values to yield: This ensures that the loop can proceed with fetching new values from the iterator.

Given that the `while True` loop will continue indefinitely, and the only condition needed for the loop to proceed is that the `iterator` has more values to yield, the state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated as it already satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and `iterator` has more values to yield**
