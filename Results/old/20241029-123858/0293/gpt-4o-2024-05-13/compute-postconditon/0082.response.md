A `StopIteration` exception might be triggered at `n, m = next(iterator)` if `iterator` is exhausted. If the exception is not raised, the function will print the values of `n` and `m`. If the exception is raised, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and they are printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, and they are printed. If `iterator` is exhausted, a `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
