To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the provided program state:

```
while total_squares < x:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The condition for the loop to execute is that `total_squares` must be less than `x`. Therefore, we need to ensure that this condition holds true after adjusting the program state.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is greater than 2
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is 1
- `m` is 3
- `total_squares` is -1

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop condition is `total_squares < x`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `total_squares` is -1 and `x` is greater than 2.
3. Since -1 is less than any number greater than 2, the loop condition `total_squares < x` is already satisfied.
4. No further adjustment to the state is needed because the loop can certainly execute one more time with the current state.

Therefore, the state remains the same for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`x` is greater than 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 3, and `total_squares` is -1**
