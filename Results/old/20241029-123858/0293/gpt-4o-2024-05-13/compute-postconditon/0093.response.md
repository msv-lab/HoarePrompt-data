The function `func(x)` is called with `x` being an input integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\). However, without knowing the implementation of `func`, no specific changes or returns can be inferred. Therefore, the state remains unchanged except for the function call.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\)**
