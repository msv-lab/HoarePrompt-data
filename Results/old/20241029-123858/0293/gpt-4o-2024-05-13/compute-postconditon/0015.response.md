To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to verify the condition in the `while` loop. According to the provided code:

```python
while total_squares < x:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue executing as long as `total_squares` is less than `x`.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is 1
- `m` is 2
- `total_squares` is 2

Additionally, if `total_squares` equals `x`, `(n, m)` is appended to `results`, resulting in `results` being [(1, 2)], and the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.

Now let's analyze the conditions:
- For the loop to execute again, `total_squares` must be less than `x`.
- At the end of the last iteration, `total_squares` is 2.
- We need to ensure that `total_squares` < `x`.

Given that `total_squares` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 2. 

Therefore, the state that ensures the loop can execute one more time is:
State: **`x` is greater than 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `m` is 2, `total_squares` is 2**
