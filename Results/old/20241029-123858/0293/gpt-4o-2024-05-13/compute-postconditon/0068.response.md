Output State: **If `total_squares` is less than `x`, the loop will execute at least once. After the first iteration, `m` is 1, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`, and `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x)`. If `total_squares` equals `x`, `(n, m)` is appended to `results` and the loop is exited. If `total_squares` is not equal to `x`, the loop continues. After the second iteration, `m` is 2, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n)`, and `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`. If `total_squares` equals `x`, `(n, m)` is appended to `results` and the loop is exited. If `total_squares` is not equal to `x`, the loop continues. After the third iteration, `m` is 3, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n) + (n - 1) * (3 - n) + (n - 3 + 1) * (3 - n + 1)`, and `x` is adjusted such that `total_squares < x and n < int(x)`. If `total_squares` equals `x`, `(n, m)` is appended to `results` and the loop is exited. If `total_squares` is not equal to `x`, the loop continues. The loop will continue until `total_squares` is no longer less than `x`. If `total_squares` never equals `x`, the loop exits when `total_squares` exceeds `x` and `results` remains unmodified. Edge cases include when `total_squares` is just below or above `x` to ensure all logical boundaries are covered.**
