`print(n, m)` outputs the values of `n` and `m`. The values of `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, or a StopIteration exception is raised if `iterator` is exhausted. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, or a StopIteration exception is raised if `iterator` is exhausted, and `n` and `m` are printed.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the next values from `iterator`, or a StopIteration exception is raised if `iterator` is exhausted, and `n` and `m` are printed**
