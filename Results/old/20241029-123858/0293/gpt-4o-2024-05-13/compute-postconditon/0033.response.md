`m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_squares` is less than `x`, `n` is less than `x`, and `m` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`total_squares` is less than `x`, `n` is less than `x`, and `m` is increased by 1**
