To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```
while n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. Let's examine the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `total_squares` is less than `x`
- `m` is 1 after the first iteration
- `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`
- `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x)`
- `results` is unchanged
- `n` is incremented by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be true. At the end of the last iteration, `n` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that the updated `n` still satisfies the loop condition.

1. **Adjusting `n`:** Since `n` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to make sure that this new value of `n` is still less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Adjusting `x`:** The value of `x` must be such that the new value of `n` (after increment) is still less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. This means `x` should be adjusted to ensure that `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` holds true.

To summarize, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the incremented `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`total_squares` is less than `x`, `m` is 1 after the first iteration, `total_squares` is `n * (2 - n)`, `x` is adjusted such that `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `results` is unchanged, `n` is incremented by 1**
