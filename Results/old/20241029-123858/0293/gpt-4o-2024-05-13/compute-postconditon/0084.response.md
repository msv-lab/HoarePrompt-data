`n` and `m` are assigned the next values from `iterator`, and `iterator` has more values to yield. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the next values yielded by `iterator`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are updated to the next values from `iterator`, and `iterator` has more values to yield.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the next values from `iterator`, and `iterator` has more values to yield**
