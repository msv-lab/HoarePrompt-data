If `x` is positive, after the loop execution, `n` will be equal to `int(x)`; `tables` is sorted, and the length of `tables` is printed; `iterator` has reached the end of `tables` and raised a `StopIteration` exception, which breaks the loop. If `tables` is empty or contains only one element, the loop will either not start or will execute only once, respectively. The final state will have `iterator` exhausted, and no further elements will be printed.
