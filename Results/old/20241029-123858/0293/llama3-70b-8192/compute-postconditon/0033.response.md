To determine whether the loop will execute one more time, we need to look at the condition of the `while` loop: `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Analyze the Given State:**
   - `x` is positive.
   - `m` will increment until it reaches `int(x)`.
   - `n` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **State Requirements for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `x` is positive, `x ** 0.5` will be a positive real number.
   - The integer part of `x ** 0.5` (i.e., `int(x ** 0.5)`) will be a non-negative integer.
   - `n` was increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so it should now be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **If `x` is positive, `m` will increment until it reaches `int(x)`, and `n` is increased by 1, and `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`**
