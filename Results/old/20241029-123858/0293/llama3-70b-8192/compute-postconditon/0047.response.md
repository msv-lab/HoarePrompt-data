Based on the given loop and examples, let's analyze the output state step by step.

### Loop executes 1 time:
Initial State: If `x` is positive, `m` will increment until it reaches `int(x)`, and `n` is increased by 1, and `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`.
```python
if func(n, m) == x:
    tables.append((n, m))

m += 1
```
Output State: `x` is positive, `m` is incremented by 1, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`, and if `func(n, m) == x`, then a tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`.

### Loop executes 2 times:
Initial State: `x` is positive, `m` is incremented by 1, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`.
```python
if func(n, m) == x:
    tables.append((n, m))

m += 1
```
Output State: `x` is a positive integer, `m` is incremented by 2, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`. If `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `tables` is appended with the tuple (`n`, `m`) containing the current values of `n` and `m`. The code does not handle the case where `func(n, m)` does not equal `x`, and `tables` remains unchanged in that scenario.

### Loop executes 3 times:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, `m` is incremented by 2, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`.
```python
if func(n, m) == x:
    tables.append((n, m))

m += 1
```
Output State: `x` is a positive integer, `m` is incremented by 3, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`. If `func(n, m) == x`, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`.

### Analyzing the Loop:
The loop will continue to iterate as long as `m` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop increments `m` each time it runs, and conditionally appends to `tables` based on the result of `func(n, m)`. 

### Edge Cases:
1. **If `x` is 0 or negative**: The loop will not execute since the condition `m < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` will not be met.
2. **If `func(n, m)` never equals `x`**: The `tables` list will remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **If `x` is positive, `m` will be incremented until it reaches `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, and `n` will be increased by 1. If `func(n, m) == x` at any point, the tuple `(n, m)` is appended to `tables`. If `x` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, `tables` will remain unchanged, and `m` will retain its initial value.**
