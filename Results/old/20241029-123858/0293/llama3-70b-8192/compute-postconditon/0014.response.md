The function `func` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`. According to the annotations, if `min(n, m)` is greater than 0, it calculates and returns the sum of `(n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `min(n, m)`. If `min(n, m)` is 0 or negative, it returns `0`.

However, the code does not handle edge cases where `n` or `m` are negative. Additionally, while the annotations imply that `x` should be between `1` and `10^18`, there is no variable `x` in the code, which could be a documentation error or unnecessary information for this function. 

**Functionality:**
The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m`. If both `n` and `m` are greater than 0, the function returns the sum of `(n - i + 1) * (m - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `min(n, m)`. If either `n` or `m` is 0 or negative, the function returns 0. The function does not handle cases where either `n` or `m` is negative, which could lead to incorrect results.
