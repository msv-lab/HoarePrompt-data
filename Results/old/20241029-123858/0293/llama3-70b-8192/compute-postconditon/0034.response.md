`m` is assigned the value of `n`. The values of `x` and `n` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: If `x` is positive, `m` will increment until it reaches `int(x)`, and `n` is increased by 1, and `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`.

Output State: **If `x` is positive, `m` will increment until it reaches `int(x)`, and `n` is increased by 1, and `n` is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`.**
