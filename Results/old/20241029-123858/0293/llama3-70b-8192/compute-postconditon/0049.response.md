According to the code provided, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `x`. Specifically, the loop condition is `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is incremented by 1.
- `m` is incremented until it reaches `int(x)` if `x` is positive.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that the condition `n < int(x ** 0.5) + 1` still holds true. 

1. Since `n` is incremented by 1 each iteration, the previous value of `n` needs to be at least 1 less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` for the loop to execute again.
2. The value of `x` should remain positive (or be adjusted to a positive value if otherwise) to ensure that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is defined and meaningful.

If `x` is positive and `n` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, then the state to ensure the loop can execute one more time should reflect that `n` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`If x is positive, m will be incremented until it reaches int(x), n is less than int(x ** 0.5) + 1`**
