The `StopIteration` exception could be raised at the statement `table = next(iterator)` if there are no more elements in the `iterator`. If there are more elements, `table` is assigned the next element from the `iterator`, and the first and second elements of `table` are printed. If the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **If `x` is positive, after the loop execution, `n` will be equal to `int(x)`; `tables` is sorted, and the length of `tables` is printed. The `iterator` is moved to the next element, and `table` is assigned the next element from `iterator`. If the `iterator` has more elements, the first and second elements of `table` are printed. If the `iterator` has no more elements, the `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
