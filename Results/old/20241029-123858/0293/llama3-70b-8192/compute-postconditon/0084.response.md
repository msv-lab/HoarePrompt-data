According to the prompt, the `while True` loop will continue indefinitely unless an explicit break condition occurs. Therefore, I need to ensure that the conditions leading to the loop continuation remain valid. Given that the loop is designed to run infinitely, the program state does not need to change for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **If `x` is positive, after the loop execution, `n` will be equal to `int(x)`; `tables` is sorted, and the length of `tables` is printed. The `iterator` is moved to the next element, and `table` is assigned the next element from `iterator`. If the `iterator` has more elements, the first and second elements of `table` are printed. If the `iterator` has no more elements, the `StopIteration` exception is raised, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
