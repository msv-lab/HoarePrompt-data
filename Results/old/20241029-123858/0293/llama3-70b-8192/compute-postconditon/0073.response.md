A `StopIteration` exception might be triggered at `table = next(iterator)` if there are no more elements in the `iterator`. If the `StopIteration` exception is raised, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program will continue to execute `print(table[0], table[1])`.

Output State: **If `x` is positive, after the loop execution, `n` will be equal to `int(x)`; `tables` is sorted, and the length of `tables` is printed; `iterator` is moved to the next element; `table` is assigned the next element from `iterator`. If the `iterator` has no more elements, the `StopIteration` exception is raised and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
