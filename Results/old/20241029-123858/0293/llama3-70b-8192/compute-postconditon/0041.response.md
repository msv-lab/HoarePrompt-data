Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `m` is incremented by 2, `n` increases by 1 and is less than `int(x)`, `m` is `n`, `m` is less than `int(x)`. If `func(n, m)` equals `x`, then `tables` is appended with the tuple (`n`, `m`) containing the current values of `n` and `m`. The code does not handle the case where `func(n, m)` does not equal `x`, and `tables` remains unchanged in that scenario.**
