`print(index, max_index)` prints the values of `index` and `max_index`. Given the initial state, `index` and `max_index` are -1. The values of other variables are not changed by the print statement.

Output State: **segments remains an empty list, `i` remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5), `l`, `r`, and `index` are assigned the next values from `iterator`, `max_right` is -1, `max_index` is -1, and the function prints -1 -1**
