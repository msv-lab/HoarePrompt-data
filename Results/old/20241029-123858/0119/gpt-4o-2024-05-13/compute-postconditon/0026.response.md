The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or conditional statement that it is directly inside. Since the initial state is unknown and the `break` statement does not modify any variables, we can conclude that the only impact is breaking out of the current loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
