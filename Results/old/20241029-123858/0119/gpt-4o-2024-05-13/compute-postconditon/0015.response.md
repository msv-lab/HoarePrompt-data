Given the initial state and the code, let's analyze the loop's behavior and determine the output state:

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and each segment is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, `segments` is an empty list, `i` is the same input integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5.

Code:
```python
while i < 0:
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    segments.append((l, r, i + 1))
    i += 1
```

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - The loop condition `while i < 0` will be evaluated before each iteration.
   - Given that the initial value of `i` is such that 1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5, the condition `i < 0` is false from the start.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute even once.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The value of `i` is always in the range 1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5 based on the initial state, which means it is always non-negative.
   - Since `i` is non-negative, the condition `i < 0` will never be true, and the loop will never begin.

3. **Output State:**
   - Since the loop does not execute, the initial values of the variables remain unchanged.
   - `segments` remains an empty list as no segments are added.
   - `i` remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5).
   - `l` and `r` are not assigned any values since the loop body does not execute.

Output State: **`segments` is an empty list, `i` is the same input integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5, `l` and `r` are not assigned any values since the loop does not execute.**
