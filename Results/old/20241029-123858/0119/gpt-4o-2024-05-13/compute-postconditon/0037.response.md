In this case, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to run indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, the loop does not have a condition based on any variables; it will always attempt to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `segments` remain an empty list
- `i` remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5)
- `l`, `r`, and `index` are assigned the next values from `iterator`
- `max_right` is updated to `r`
- `max_index` is updated to `index`
- If the iterator is exhausted, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement

Since the loop doesn't have a conditional check and will always attempt to run again unless broken out of, we simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **segments remain an empty list, `i` remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5), `l`, `r`, and `index` are assigned the next values from `iterator`, `max_right` is updated to `r`, and `max_index` is updated to `index`**
