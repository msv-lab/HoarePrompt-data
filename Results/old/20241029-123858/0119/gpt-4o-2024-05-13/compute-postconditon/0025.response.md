`max_index` is assigned the value `index`, and the previous value of `index` is from `iterator`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **segments remains an empty list, `i` remains the same input integer (1 ≤ i ≤ 3·10^5), `l`, `r`, and `index` are assigned the next values from `iterator`, `max_right` is `r`, `max_index` is `index`**
