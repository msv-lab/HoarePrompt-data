`i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is -1, so the new value of `i` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` remains the same positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5), `segments` remains an empty list, `_` remains the same value as `n`, `i` is 0, `j` remains the same value as `n`**
