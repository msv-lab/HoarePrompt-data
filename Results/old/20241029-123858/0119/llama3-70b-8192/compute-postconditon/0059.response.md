`j` is incremented by 1. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: If `i` is not equal to `j` and the segment at index `i` starts at or after the segment at index `j` starts, and the segment at index `i` ends at or before the segment at index `j` ends, then the function prints 0 and `n + 1` and exits. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and `j` is increased by 1.
