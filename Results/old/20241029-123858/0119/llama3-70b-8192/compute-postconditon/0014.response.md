To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the `while` loop condition.

### Analysis
1. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - Each segment is represented by two integers \( l_i \) and \( r_i \) such that \( 1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq 10^9 \).
   - `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`) appended.
   - `_` is less than or equal to 0.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.

2. **While loop condition**:
   ```python
   while _ < 0:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
- The loop condition is `while _ < 0`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is less than or equal to 0. For the loop to certainly execute one more time, `_` must be strictly less than 0.

### Conclusion
Since `_` is already less than or equal to 0, it is sufficient to ensure that `_` is strictly less than 0 for the loop to execute again. No other state adjustments related to `n`, `segments`, `l`, or `r` are necessary for the loop to proceed.

### Final State
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`) appended; `_` is less than 0; `l` and `r` are input integers**
