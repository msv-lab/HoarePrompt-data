`_` is incremented by 1. Given that `_` is initially less than 0, the output state will reflect this increment.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`) appended; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is an input integer; `r` is an input integer**
