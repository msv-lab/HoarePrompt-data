Let's analyze the given problem step by step:

1. The `while` loop condition is `j < 0`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 0.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was increased by 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must have been less than -1 before the increment, so that after increasing by 1, it is still less than 0.

Now, let's adjust the state accordingly:

- Since `a` and `b` are integers and their updates depend on each other, their current state does not directly affect whether the loop will execute again. Therefore, we don't need to modify `a` and `b` for this specific condition.
- The key state that needs adjustment is `j`. Initially, `j` must have been less than -1 so that after incrementing by 1, it remains less than 0.

So, the state should be:
State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `j` is less than -1**
