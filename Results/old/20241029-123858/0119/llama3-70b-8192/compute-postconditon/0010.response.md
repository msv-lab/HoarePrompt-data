Let's analyze the provided state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
1. `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
2. Each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq 10^9\).
3. `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`) appended.
4. `_` is incremented by 1.
5. `l` is an input integer.
6. `r` is an input integer.

### Given `while` Loop Condition:
```python
while _ < 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- For the `while` loop to execute, the condition `_ < 0` must be true.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `_` has been incremented by 1.
- We need to ensure that `_ < 0` holds true so that the loop can execute one more time.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `_` must have a value less than 0. This means that before the increment, `_` must have been less than -1.
2. No changes are required for the other variables (`n`, `segments`, `l`, `r`) as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `_` such that it remains less than 0 after the increment.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5; each segment is represented by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ 10^9; `segments` contains the tuple (`l`, `r`) appended; `_` is less than -1; `l` is an input integer; `r` is an input integer**
