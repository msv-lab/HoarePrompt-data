The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program. Therefore, any state of the variables remains unchanged, and the program execution stops.

Output State: **If `i` is not equal to `j` and the segment at index `i` starts at or after the segment at index `j` starts, and the segment at index `i` ends at or before the segment at index `j` ends, then the function prints 0 and `n + 1` and exits. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and `j` is less than -1, and the function prints `i + 1` and `j + 1`**
