`n`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers. The previous values of these variables are not relevant after reassignment. Therefore, the output state is `n`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b, p, q ≤ 10^9**
