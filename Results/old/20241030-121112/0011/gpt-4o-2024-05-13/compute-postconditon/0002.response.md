The function `func` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers. The function calculates the product of `x` and `y` and then performs integer division by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `x` and `y`, and return the value of `x * y // gcd(x, y)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers, and returns the value of `x * y // gcd(x, y)`.**
