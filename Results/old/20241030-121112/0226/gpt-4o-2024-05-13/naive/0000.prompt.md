You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with a function description and a Python function code snippet. You need to provide if the code does what the function description says. Please avoid describing how the program runs. If the code satisfies the description reply CORRECT, otherwise reply INCORRECT with an explanation. You must adhere to the text format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.

Description: You may have heard of the pie rule before. It states that if two people wish to fairly share a slice of pie, one person should cut the slice in half, and the other person should choose who gets which slice. Alice and Bob have many slices of pie, and rather than cutting the slices in half, each individual slice will be eaten by just one person.

The way Alice and Bob decide who eats each slice is as follows. First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the "decider" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant. They continue until no slices of pie are left.

All of the slices are of excellent quality, so each participant obviously wants to maximize the total amount of pie they get to eat. Assuming both players make their decisions optimally, how much pie will each participant receive?


-----Input-----

Input will begin with an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), the number of slices of pie. 

Following this is a line with N integers indicating the sizes of the slices (each between 1 and 100000, inclusive), in the order in which they must be handed out.


-----Output-----

Print two integers. First, the sum of the sizes of slices eaten by Alice, then the sum of the sizes of the slices eaten by Bob, assuming both players make their decisions optimally.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
141 592 653

Output
653 733

Input
5
10 21 10 21 10

Output
31 41



-----Note-----

In the first example, Bob takes the size 141 slice for himself and gives the decider token to Alice. Then Alice gives the size 592 slice to Bob and keeps the decider token for herself, so that she can then give the size 653 slice to herself.
Python Fucntion:
```
def optimal_pie_distribution():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    slices = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    # Initialize sums for Alice and Bob
    alice_sum = 0
    bob_sum = 0
    
    # Initialize who has the decider token
    # 0 means Bob has the token, 1 means Alice has the token
    decider = 0
    
    # Iterate over the slices
    for i in range(N):
        if decider == 0:
            # Bob decides
            if i < N - 1 and slices[i] < slices[i + 1]:
                # Give the slice to Alice and keep the decider token
                alice_sum += slices[i]
                decider = 0
            else:
                # Take the slice for Bob and pass the decider token to Alice
                bob_sum += slices[i]
                decider = 1
        else:
            # Alice decides
            if i < N - 1 and slices[i] < slices[i + 1]:
                # Give the slice to Bob and keep the decider token
                bob_sum += slices[i]
                decider = 1
            else:
                # Take the slice for Alice and pass the decider token to Bob
                alice_sum += slices[i]
                decider = 0
    
    print(alice_sum, bob_sum)

# Run the function
optimal_pie_distribution()

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Use the format: RESULT: **Correct or Incorrect**.
