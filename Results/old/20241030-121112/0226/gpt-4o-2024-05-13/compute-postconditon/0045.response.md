Output State: **Variable `i` is less than `N` and increased by 1. If `decider` is 0 and `i` is less than `N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `alice_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `decider` is 0, `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. If `decider` is not 0 and `i` is less than `N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `decider` is not 0, `alice_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0.**
