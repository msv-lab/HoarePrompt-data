`bob_sum` is incremented by the value at the index `i` of the array `slices`. Since `i` is less than -1, the exact change in `bob_sum` cannot be determined without knowing the values in the `slices` array. Therefore, the output state is: variable `i` is less than -1, `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]`.

Output State: **variable `i` is less than -1, `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]`**
