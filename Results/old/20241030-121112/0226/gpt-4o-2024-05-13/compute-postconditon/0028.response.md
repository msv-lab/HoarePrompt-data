`alice_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]`. However, the initial values of `alice_sum` and `slices[i]` are not provided. Since the loop cannot execute one more time given the constraints on `N`, the output state can only reflect this condition.

Output State: **The loop cannot execute one more time given the constraints on `N`.**
