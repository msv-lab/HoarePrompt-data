`bob_sum` is incremented by the value at index `i` in the `slices` array. Since `i` is less than -1, it refers to an index from the end of the `slices` array. Therefore, the Output State is: `bob_sum` is incremented by the value at index `i` in `slices`, where `i` is less than -1.

Output State: **`bob_sum` is incremented by the value at index `i` in `slices`, where `i` is less than -1**
