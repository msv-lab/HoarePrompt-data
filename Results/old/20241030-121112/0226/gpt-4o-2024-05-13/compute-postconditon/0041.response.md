`alice_sum` is incremented by the value of `slices[i]`, where `i` is less than -1. The previous values of `alice_sum` and `slices[i]` are unknown, so the output state is: variable `alice_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` where `i` is less than -1.
Output State: **variable `alice_sum` is increased by `slices[i]` where `i` is less than -1**
