To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `i < 0` in the `while` statement. The loop will only execute if `i` is less than 0. 

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: variable `i` is increased by 1.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `i < 0`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 0.

2. **Given State**:
   - `i` was increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - If `i` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `i` (before the increment) must have been less than -1. This ensures that after the increment, `i` is still less than 0.

Therefore, `i` must have been less than -1 before it was increased by 1.

State: **variable `i` is less than -1**
