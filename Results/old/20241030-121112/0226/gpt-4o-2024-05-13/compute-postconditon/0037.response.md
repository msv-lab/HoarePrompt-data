`decider` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `bob_sum` is incremented by the value at index `i` in `slices`, where `i` is less than -1, `decider` is 1.

Output State: **`bob_sum` is incremented by the value at index `i` in `slices`, where `i` is less than -1, `decider` is 1**
