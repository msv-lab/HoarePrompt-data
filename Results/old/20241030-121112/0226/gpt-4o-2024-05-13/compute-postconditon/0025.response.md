Postcondition: **Given that the loop cannot execute one more time due to constraints on `N`, if `i < N - 1` and `slices[i]` is less than `slices[i + 1]`, then `alice_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 0. Otherwise, `bob_sum` is incremented by `slices[i]` and `decider` is set to 1.**
