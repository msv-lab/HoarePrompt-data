`alice` is incremented by the value of `size`, and `size` is the next element from `iterator`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: **N is an input integer between 1 and 50, sizes is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive, alice is the previous alice value plus size, bob is 0, decider is True, iterator is an iterator over sizes, size is the next element from iterator**.
