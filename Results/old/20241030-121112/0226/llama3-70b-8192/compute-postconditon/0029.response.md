Since the `while` loop in question is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Given the provided state, the loop will break if the iterator has no more elements. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the iterator still has elements to iterate over.

Thus, for the loop to proceed with another iteration, we need to maintain the state where the iterator has more elements. We do not need to adjust any other states since the loop condition is always `True`.

State: **`N` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `sizes` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive, `alice` and `bob` are incremented by elements from `sizes` based on the value of `decider`, `iterator` is an iterator over `sizes` with more elements, `size` is the next element from `iterator`, `decider` is toggled to its opposite value each iteration**
