`N` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The list `sizes` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: N is an input integer between 1 and 50, and sizes is a list of N integers where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive.

Output State: **N is an input integer between 1 and 50, and sizes is a list of N integers where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive**
