Postcondition: **N is an input integer between 1 and 50, sizes is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive, iterator is an iterator over sizes, and size is the next element from iterator. If decider is True, alice is incremented by size and bob remains 0. Otherwise, alice remains 0 and bob is incremented by size.**
