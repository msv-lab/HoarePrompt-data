`bob` is increased by the value of `size`, and the value of `size` is the next element from `iterator`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `sizes` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100000 inclusive, `alice` is increased by `size` if `decider` is True, `bob` is increased by `size` (with `size` being the next element from `iterator`), `iterator` is an iterator over `sizes` with more elements to iterate, `size` is the next element from `iterator`, `decider` is toggled to its opposite value.
