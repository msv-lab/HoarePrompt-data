RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The provided code sorts the list of pie sizes in descending order and then alternates slices between Alice and Bob. This is not in line with the problem description which specifies that the pies are to be handed out in the given order, not sorted order. The code does not simulate the correct optimal decision-making process where each player decides based on the given order and the decider token.
