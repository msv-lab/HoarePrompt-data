Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program sorts the sizes of the pie slices in descending order and then alternates the assignment of pie slices between Alice and Bob. This approach does not adhere to the problem description, which states that the current holder of the decider token will always give the next slice to one participant and the decider token to the other participant. The problem's optimal decision-making strategy involves more than just sorting the slices and alternating assignments. Let's consider an example to illustrate a case where the program fails to correctly implement the optimal strategy:

Consider the input:
```
4
50 100 100 50
```

According to the program's logic:

1. The sizes are sorted in descending order: [100, 100, 50, 50]
2. Alice gets the first slice (100), Bob gets the second slice (100), Alice gets the third slice (50), Bob gets the fourth slice (50).

So, the output of the program will be:
```
150 150
```

However, the correct optimal strategy would be:
1. Bob starts with the decider token and gives the first slice (50) to Alice, keeping the decider token.
2. Alice gives the second slice (100) to Bob, keeping the decider token.
3. Bob gives the third slice (50) to Alice, keeping the decider token.
4. Alice gives the fourth slice (100) to Bob, keeping the decider token.

The correct output should be:
```
100 200
```

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this example and does not follow the optimal strategy as described in the problem statement.
