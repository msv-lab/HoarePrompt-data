`j` is assigned the value `i + 1`. Therefore, `j` is `n + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` will retain its initial value, `vectors` will remain as described, `min_angle` is float('inf'), `ans` is (-1, -1), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`_` will retain its initial value, `vectors` will remain as described, `min_angle` is float('inf'), `ans` is (-1, -1), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`**
