`magnitude_j` is calculated as `math.sqrt(xj ** 2 + yj ** 2)`. The values of `xj` and `yj` are assigned the values of `vectors[j]`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`min_angle` remains `float('inf')`, `ans` remains `(-1, -1)`, `i` becomes less than 0, `j` is less than 2, `xi` and `yi` are assigned the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are assigned the values of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is calculated as `math.sqrt(xi ** 2 + yi ** 2)`, `magnitude_j` is calculated as `math.sqrt(xj ** 2 + yj ** 2)`**.
