`xi` and `yi` are assigned the values of `vectors[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` will retain its initial value, `vectors` will remain as described, `min_angle` is float('inf'), `ans` is (-1, -1), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `xi` and `yi` are the values of `vectors[i]`.
