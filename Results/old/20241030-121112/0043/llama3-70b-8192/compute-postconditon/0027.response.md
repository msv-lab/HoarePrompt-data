`ans` is assigned the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, where `i` is `n` and `j` is `n + 1`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `(n + 1, n + 2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` will retain its initial value, `vectors` will remain as described, `min_angle` is `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`, `ans` is `(n + 1, n + 2)`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `xi` and `yi` are the values of `vectors[i]`, `xj` and `yj` are the values of `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is `math.sqrt(xi)`, `magnitude_j` is `math.sqrt(xj)`, `angle` is `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`**
