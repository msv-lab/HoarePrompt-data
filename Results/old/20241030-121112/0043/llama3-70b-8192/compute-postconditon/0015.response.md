Given the loop and the initial state, let's analyze and determine the output state step by step.

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` is an empty list, `_` is not defined but used in the loop condition.

The loop's code:
```
while _ < 0:
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    vectors.append((x, y))
    _ += 1
```

1. **Loop executes 1 time:**
   - Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` is an empty list, `_` is less than 0.
   - Execution: 
     ```
     x, y = map(int, input().split())
     vectors.append((x, y))
     _ += 1
     ```
   - Output State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` contains the tuple (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, `_` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop executes 2 times:**
   - Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` contains the tuple (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, `_` is less than 0.
   - Execution:
     ```
     x, y = map(int, input().split())
     vectors.append((x, y))
     _ += 1
     ```
   - Output State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` contains two tuples (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, `_` is incremented by 1.

3. **Loop executes 3 times:**
   - Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` contains two tuples (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, `_` is less than 0.
   - Execution:
     ```
     x, y = map(int, input().split())
     vectors.append((x, y))
     _ += 1
     ```
   - Output State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `vectors` contains three tuples (x, y), `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting them to integers, `_` is incremented by 1.

Now, let's consider the overall possible output state based on the loop's logic and potential edge cases:

1. **If `_` is negative initially:**
   - The loop will execute while `_` is less than 0.
   - Each iteration will append a new tuple (x, y) to `vectors`.
   - `_` will be incremented by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop will terminate when `_` reaches 0 or greater.

2. **If `_` is 0 or positive initially:**
   - The loop will not execute at all because the condition `_ < 0` is not satisfied.
   - `vectors` will remain an empty list.
   - `_` will retain its initial value.

Thus, the final output state taking into account all possible initial conditions and iterations is:

Output State: **If `_` is negative initially, `vectors` will contain tuples (x, y) for each input pair until `_` becomes non-negative, and `_` will be non-negative. If `_` is 0 or positive initially, `vectors` will remain an empty list, and `_` will retain its initial value.**
