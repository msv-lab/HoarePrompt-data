`magnitude_i` is assigned the value of `math.sqrt(xi ** 2 + yi ** 2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `min_angle` is the smallest angle computed between the vectors, `ans` is the pair of indices (1-based) corresponding to the vectors that form this angle, `j` is less than 0 and incremented by 1, `i` is less than -1, `xi`, `yi` are assigned the values from `vectors[i]`, `xj`, `yj` are updated to the values from `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is the value of `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is `math.sqrt(xi ** 2 + yi ** 2)`, `magnitude_j` is the value of `math.sqrt(xj)`, `angle` is the value of `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j)), If `angle` is less than `min_angle`, `min_angle` is updated to `angle` and `ans` is updated to the pair of indices (i + 1, j + 1).
