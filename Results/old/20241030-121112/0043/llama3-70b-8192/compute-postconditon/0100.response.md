`min_angle` is assigned the value of `angle`. The previous value of `min_angle` is the smallest angle computed between the vectors, and `angle` is the value of `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `min_angle` is `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`, `ans` is the pair of indices (1-based) corresponding to the vectors that form this angle, `j` is less than 0, `i` is less than -1, `xi`, `yi` are assigned the values from `vectors[i]`, `xj`, `yj` are assigned the values from `vectors[j]`, `dot_product` is the value of `xi * xj + yi * yj`, `magnitude_i` is the value of `math.sqrt(xi`, `magnitude_j` is the value of `math.sqrt(xj`, `angle` is the value of `math.acos(dot_product / (magnitude_i * magnitude_j))`.
