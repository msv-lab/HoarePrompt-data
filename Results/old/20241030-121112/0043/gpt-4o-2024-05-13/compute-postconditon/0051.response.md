The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided information. However, the constraints given suggest that `func` might internally deal with certain variables or inputs.

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- For each vector, `x` and `y` are integers such that \(|x|, |y| \leq 10,000\) and \(x^2 + y^2 > 0\).

The function might be designed to process vectors or points in a two-dimensional space, given the constraints on `x` and `y`.

Without more explicit details on the exact output or behavior of the function, I'll infer the likely functionality:

The functionality of the function `func` is to handle a number of vectors defined by `n` (an integer within the given range). For each vector, the components `x` and `y` are integers within the specified range, ensuring that each vector has a non-zero magnitude.

Functionality: **The function processes `n` vectors, each defined by integers `x` and `y` that meet the given constraints, ensuring each vector has a non-zero magnitude.**
