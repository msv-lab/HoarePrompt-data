`a` is assigned the value `vectors[i - 1][1]` and `b` is assigned the value `vectors[i][1]`. Given `i` is 1, `a` is assigned `vectors[0][1]` and `b` is assigned `vectors[1][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; for each vector, `x` and `y` are integers such that |`x`|, |`y`| ≤ 10,000 and `x`^2 + `y`^2 > 0; `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`; `vectors` is a sorted list; `i` is 1; `vectors` is sorted; `min_angle` is assigned the value `vectors[1][0] - vectors[0][0]`; `a` is assigned the value `vectors[0][1]`; `b` is assigned the value `vectors[1][1]`; `angle_diff` is assigned the value `vectors[1][0] - vectors[0][0]`**
