The function `func` reads input data from `sys.stdin`, processes vectors defined by integers `x` and `y`, and prints the indices of the two vectors with the smallest angular difference. It ensures that each vector has a non-zero magnitude. The function sorts the vectors based on their angles and identifies the pair with the smallest angular difference.

However, there are some potential issues and edge cases not handled by the function:

1. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop `while i < 0:` should be `while i > 0:` to correctly iterate over the vectors.
2. **IndexError Handling**: If the input data does not contain enough elements to form `n` vectors, an `IndexError` will occur.
3. **First and Last Vector Angle Difference**: The calculation `first_last_angle_diff = 2 * math.pi - (vectors[-1][0] - vectors[0][0])` might not correctly handle the wrap-around case in the angle comparison.
4. **Edge Case for Two Vectors**: If there are exactly two vectors, the function should handle this case without unnecessary complexity.

Functionality: ** The function reads `n` vectors from standard input, calculates the angles of these vectors, and prints the indices of the two vectors with the smallest angular difference. It does not handle cases where the input data is insufficient to form `n` vectors, and there is an error in the loop condition for processing the vectors. Additionally, the function might not correctly handle angle wrap-around cases. **
