RESULT: **Correct**

Explanation:

1. The function reads input correctly and parses the number of vectors \( n \) and their coordinates.
2. It calculates the angle of each vector using `math.atan2(y, x)` and stores these angles along with their indices.
3. The vectors are sorted based on their angles.
4. It iterates through the sorted list of vectors to find the pair of vectors with the smallest angle difference.
5. It also checks the circular case, i.e., the angle difference between the first and last vector.
6. Finally, it prints the indices of the pair of vectors with the minimal non-oriented angle.

The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
