`A` and `B` are assigned the values returned by the function `func` when called with `n` and `k` as arguments. The specific values of `A` and `B` depend on the implementation of `func`, which is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `A` and `B` are the values returned by `func(n, k)`.

Output State: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from input, `A` and `B` are the values returned by `func(n, k)`**
