According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `0`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `0`. This means:
\[ k + 1 < 0 \]
\[ k < -1 \]

Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to be less than `-1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is (2^n - k), `denominator` is 2^n, `i` is `k + 1`, `k` is less than `-1`**
