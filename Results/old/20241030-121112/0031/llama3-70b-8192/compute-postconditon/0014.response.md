`i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is `k + 2`, so the new value of `i` is `k + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is (2^n - k) * (2^n - (k + 1)) * (2^n - (k + 2)), `denominator` is 2^(3n), `i` is k + 3, `k` is less than -2**
