`denominator` is divided by `gcd` using integer division. The initial state is divided into two cases based on the value of `k`.

1. If `k` is greater than or equal to 0:
   - `denominator` is initially 1.
   - `gcd` is initially 1.
   - After executing `denominator //= gcd`, `denominator` remains 1 since 1 divided by 1 is 1.

2. If `k` is less than 0:
   - `denominator` is `2^(n * abs(k))`.
   - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.
   - After executing `denominator //= gcd`, `denominator` is updated to `2^(n * abs(k)) // gcd`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is `k`, and `gcd` is 1. If `k` is less than 0, `numerator` is the product of terms `(2^n - k) * (2^n - (k + 1)) * ... * (2^n - (-1))` divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is `2^(n * abs(k)) // gcd`, `i` is 0, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
