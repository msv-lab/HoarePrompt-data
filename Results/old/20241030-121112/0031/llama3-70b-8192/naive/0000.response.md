RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the probability of no one having the same birthday instead of at least two people having the same birthday. To find the probability of at least two people having the same birthday, we need to subtract the probability of all people having different birthdays from 1. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where \( k > 2^n \), which guarantees that at least two people will share the same birthday. Moreover, the code does not take into account the modulus operation described in the problem statement for the initial probabilities.
