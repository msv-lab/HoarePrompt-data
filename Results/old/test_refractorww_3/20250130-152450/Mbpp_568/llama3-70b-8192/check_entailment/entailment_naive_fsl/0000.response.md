Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns a list of `n` empty dictionaries. This implementation is correct according to the problem description. It works for any positive integer value of `n`. For example:

- If `n = 0`, it returns an empty list: `[]`.
- If `n = 3`, it returns a list of three empty dictionaries: `[{}, {}, {}]`.

The function generates the desired output for any valid input, and there are no edge cases that this function fails to handle. Therefore, the function is correct.
