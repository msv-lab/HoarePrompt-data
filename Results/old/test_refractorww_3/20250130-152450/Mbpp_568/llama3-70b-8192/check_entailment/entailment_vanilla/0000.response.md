Reasoning:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of `n` empty dictionaries. The list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(n)]` generates a list containing `n` empty dictionaries, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Correctness: **True**
