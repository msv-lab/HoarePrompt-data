Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1(n)` aims to create a list of `n` empty dictionaries. The function takes a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer (as stated in the problem description). 

The function returns a list comprehension that generates a list of `n` empty dictionaries. Specifically, `return [{} for _ in range(n)]` creates an empty dictionary `{}` and repeats it `n` times using a loop controlled by `range(n)`.

Given that the function correctly implements the required behavior without any logical errors, it should meet the requirement of creating a list of `n` empty dictionaries, where `n` is a non-negative integer.

Correctness: **True**
