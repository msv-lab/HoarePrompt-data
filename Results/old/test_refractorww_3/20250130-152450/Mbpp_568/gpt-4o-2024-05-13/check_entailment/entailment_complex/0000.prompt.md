You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to create a list of N empty dictionaries.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(5) == [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
assert func_1(6) == [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
assert func_1(7) == [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(N):
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]
    #A list containing N empty dictionaries
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `N` as a parameter and returns a list containing exactly `N` empty dictionaries. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. The function creates a list of length `N`, where each element is an empty dictionary.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
