Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries as per the problem description. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a non-negative integer `N` and returning a list of exactly `N` empty dictionaries. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints, and the provided test cases (`func_1(5)`, `func_1(6)`, `func_1(7)`) confirm the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is valid.
