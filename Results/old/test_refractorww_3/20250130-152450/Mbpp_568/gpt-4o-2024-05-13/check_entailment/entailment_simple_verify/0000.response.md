Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries, as evidenced by the provided assertions. The annotated version confirms that the function generates a list containing `N` empty dictionaries, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There is no indication of any issues or edge cases where the function might fail under the assumption of valid input. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
