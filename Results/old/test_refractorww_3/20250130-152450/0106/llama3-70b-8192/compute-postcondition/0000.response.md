Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and still satisfy the conditions given in the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the input values, but their constraints remain the same.
