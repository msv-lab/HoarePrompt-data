Output State: **`a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial conditions.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1` to the variable `b_block`. This does not affect the values of `a_floor`, `a_block`, or `b_floor`. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the computation of `b_block`.
