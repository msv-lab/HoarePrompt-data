Output State: **`a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial conditions.**

Explanation: The code calculates `a_block` as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. It does not affect the values of `a_floor`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, while `a_block` is updated according to the given formula.
