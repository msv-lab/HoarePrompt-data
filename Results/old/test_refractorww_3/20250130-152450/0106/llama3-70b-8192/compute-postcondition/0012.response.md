Output State: **`a_floor` is (a - 1) % m + 1, `a_block` is (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, or the difference between `n` and the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, `min_floor_time` is (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10.**

Explanation:
- The variable `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. Since `a_floor` and `b_floor` are already defined in terms of `a` and `b`, this calculation updates `min_floor_time` without affecting the values of `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time`.
