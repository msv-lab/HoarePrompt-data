Output State: **`min_block_time` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, or the difference between `n` and the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15; `min_floor_time` is either `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` if `a_floor > b_floor`, or `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10` otherwise; the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` is printed.**

In this output state, the variables `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` retain their calculated values from the initial state, and the program prints their sum. The values of `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
