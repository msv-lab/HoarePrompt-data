Postcondition: `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, or the difference between `n` and the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, and `min_floor_time` is either `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` if `a_floor > b_floor`, or `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10` otherwise.
