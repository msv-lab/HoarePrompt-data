Postcondition: `a_floor` is `(a - 1) % m + 1` and is greater than `b_floor`, `a_block` is `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15, or the difference between `n` and the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` multiplied by 15.
