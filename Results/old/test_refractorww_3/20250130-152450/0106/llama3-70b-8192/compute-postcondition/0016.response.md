Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It checks if two given integers `a` and `b` (where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b) satisfy the conditions defined by positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000). Based on these conditions, it returns specific outputs as follows:**
- Returns an error message indicating that `a` and `b` should be within the range defined by `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- Returns an error message indicating that `a` and `b` should not be equal.

This means the function validates the inputs `a` and `b` against the provided ranges and uniqueness constraint, returning appropriate messages if any of the conditions fail.
