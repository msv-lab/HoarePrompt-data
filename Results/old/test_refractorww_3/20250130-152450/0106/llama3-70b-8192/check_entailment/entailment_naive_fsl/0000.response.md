Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where both the start and end blocks are the same but the floors are different. Specifically, the program calculates the minimum time to move between blocks and floors, but it does not account for the fact that the lift can be called before reaching the desired floor, which could potentially save time. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 10 5
205 206
```

In this case, both Edvard and Natasha are on the 5th floor of different blocks. The program incorrectly calculates the time as 10 seconds for the lift plus 10 seconds to walk to the next block, totaling 20 seconds. However, the correct approach would be to call the lift, which takes 10 seconds, and then walk 1 second to the desired floor, totaling 11 seconds. The program does not consider this optimal path, leading to an incorrect result.
