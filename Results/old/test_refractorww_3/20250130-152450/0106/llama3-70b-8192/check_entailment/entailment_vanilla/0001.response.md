### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Floor and Block Calculation**: 
   - The floor calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1` and `(b - 1) % m + 1` is correct as it determines the floor number based on the apartment number.
   - The block calculation `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1` is also correct as it determines the block number based on the apartment number.

3. **Block Distance Calculation**:
   - The line `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15` calculates the minimum time to move between blocks. This is done by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise distances and choosing the minimum. This logic is correct.

4. **Floor Distance Calculation**:
   - The condition `if a_floor > b_floor:` checks which direction has fewer floors to travel. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, it calculates the time to go from `a_floor` to `b_floor` via the elevator plus the walking time. Otherwise, it calculates the opposite direction.
   - The time calculation `if a_floor > b_floor: (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` is correct as it accounts for the time to travel the floors plus the elevator wait time.

5. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - The total time is calculated by adding the block travel time (`min_block_time`) and the floor travel time (`min_floor_time`).

Given that all calculations align with the problem statement and the logic is sound, the program appears to be correct.
