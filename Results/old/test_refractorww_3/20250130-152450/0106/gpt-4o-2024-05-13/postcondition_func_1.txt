The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment`, which represents the apartment number within a specified range. It returns a tuple containing two elements: the first element is the block number, calculated as `((apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1)`, and the second element is the floor number, calculated as `((apartment - 1) % (m * k) // k + 1)`. The function performs the following steps:
1. It calculates the block number by performing integer division of `(apartment - 1)` by `(m * k)` and adding 1.
2. It calculates the floor number by taking the modulus of `(apartment - 1)` with `(m * k)`, then performing integer division by `k` and adding 1.
The function handles the case where `apartment` is within the valid range `[1, n·m·k]`. If `apartment` is outside this range, the function's behavior is undefined because the calculation assumes the correct values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are not provided as inputs. No additional error checking is performed for invalid `apartment` values.
