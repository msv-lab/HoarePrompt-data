Output State: **`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are as defined in the precondition. If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `min_walk_time` as the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` remain unchanged, and all other variables also retain their initial conditions.
