Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are as defined in the precondition. If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `reverse_walk_time` based on the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. This does not affect the values of `direct_walk_time`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b`. The state of `time_to_exit` remains unchanged unless `floor_a` is 1, in which case it is 0; otherwise, it is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1.
