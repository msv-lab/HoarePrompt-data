Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are as defined in the precondition. If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `direct_walk_time` as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, modulo `n`, multiplied by 15. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `time_to_exit` depends on the value of `floor_a` as specified in the precondition.
