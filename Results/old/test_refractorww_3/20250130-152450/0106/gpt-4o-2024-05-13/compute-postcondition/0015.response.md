Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: n, m, k, a, and b. n, m, and k are positive integers where 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000, and a and b are positive integers where 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k and a != b. It returns total_time, which is calculated as 10 plus floor_a minus 1 plus the minimum of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time plus 5 times (floor_b - 1).**
