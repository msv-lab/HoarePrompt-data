Output State: **`block` is the value of ((`apartment` - 1) // (`m` * `k`) + 1); `apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number within the range [1, n·m·k]; `floor_within_block` is (`apartment` - 1) % (`m` * `k`); `floor` is (`floor_within_block` // `k` + 1)**

This means that after executing the line of code, the value of `floor` has been calculated based on `floor_within_block`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
