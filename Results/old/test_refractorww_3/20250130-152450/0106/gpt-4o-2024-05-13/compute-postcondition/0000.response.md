Output State: **`block` is the value of ((`apartment` - 1) // (`m` * `k`) + 1), `apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number within the range [1, n路m路k].**

Explanation: The code calculates the `block` by determining which block the apartment belongs to based on its position within the range `[1, n路m路k]`. The formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` computes the block number. The `apartment` variable retains its original value and remains within the specified range.
