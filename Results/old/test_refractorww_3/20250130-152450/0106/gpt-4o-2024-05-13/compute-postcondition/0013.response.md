Output State: **`total_time` is `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1, `time_to_target_floor` is 5 times (`floor_b` - 1)**

Explanation: 
- The variable `total_time` is assigned the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.
- `min_walk_time` remains the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
- `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` remain unchanged as they depend on the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`.
- `time_to_exit` and `time_to_target_floor` also remain unchanged as they are based on the values of `floor_a` and `floor_b`.

All other variables from the initial state are still in their original form, and `total_time` now holds the new calculated value based on the given formula.
