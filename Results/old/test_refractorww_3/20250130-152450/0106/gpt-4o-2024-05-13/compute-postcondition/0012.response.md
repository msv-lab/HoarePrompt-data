Output State: **`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are as defined in the precondition, `time_to_exit` is 10 plus `floor_a` minus 1, `time_to_target_floor` is 5 times (`floor_b` - 1)**.

Explanation: The code calculates `time_to_target_floor` as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. This calculation does not affect `min_walk_time`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and the state of `time_to_exit`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values or expressions. The new value of `time_to_target_floor` is updated based on the given formula.
