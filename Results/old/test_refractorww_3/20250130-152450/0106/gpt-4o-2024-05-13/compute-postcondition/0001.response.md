Output State: **`block` is the value of ((`apartment` - 1) // (`m` * `k`) + 1); `apartment` is an integer representing the apartment number within the range [1, n·m·k]; `floor_within_block` is (`apartment` - 1) % (`m` * `k`).**

Explanation: The code calculates `floor_within_block` as the remainder when `apartment` is divided by `m * k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
