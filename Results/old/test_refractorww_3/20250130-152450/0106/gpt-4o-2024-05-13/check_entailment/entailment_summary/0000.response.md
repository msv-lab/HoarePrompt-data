Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the apartments are located in different blocks and the person needs to use the elevator to reach the target floor. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the time taken to use the elevator. According to the problem description, the elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor to move up or down. This missing functionality means the code cannot accurately calculate the minimum time in all scenarios, especially when the target floor is significantly higher than the current floor.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 10 5
200 1000
```
In this case, Edvard is in apartment 200 (which is on the 10th floor of the 4th block) and Natasha is in apartment 1000 (which is on the 20th floor of the 4th block). The correct solution would involve using the elevator to go from the 10th floor to the 20th floor, which takes 10 seconds to wait for the elevator and 10 seconds to travel between floors (10 seconds per floor for 10 floors). However, the provided code does not include this calculation, leading to an incorrect result.
