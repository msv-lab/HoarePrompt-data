Final: **True**

### Reasoning:

1. **Function `get_location`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the block and floor for a given apartment number.
   - It divides the apartment number by \(m \times k\) to find the block and uses the modulus operation to find the floor within that block.
   - The logic here is sound and matches the problem's requirements.

2. **Main Function `func_1`**:
   - **Exit Time Calculation**:
     - If the apartment of Edvard (`a`) is on the first floor, the exit time is 0. Otherwise, it calculates the time to exit the building using the lift.
     - This is correct as it accounts for waiting 10 seconds for the lift and an additional 1 second per floor to travel.
   - **Direct and Reverse Walk Time Calculation**:
     - Direct walk time: Calculates the minimum time to walk directly from Edvard’s block to Natasha’s block.
     - Reverse walk time: Calculates the minimum time to walk in the opposite direction around the building.
     - The logic here considers the circular nature of the building and chooses the shortest path.
   - **Time to Target Floor**:
     - This calculates the time needed to go from Edvard’s current floor to Natasha’s target floor.
     - It multiplies the difference between the floors by 5 seconds.
   - **Total Time Calculation**:
     - Adds up all the times calculated above to get the total minimum time.

Given the output hints and the provided code, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The `get_location` function handles the calculation of block and floor numbers accurately, and the main function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum time considering all possible movements around the building.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description. Final: **True**.
