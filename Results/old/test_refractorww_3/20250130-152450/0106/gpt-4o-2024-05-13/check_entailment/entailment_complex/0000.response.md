Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not handle the case when the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` are not provided. Specifically, the `get_location` function relies on the global variables `m` and `k`, which are not defined within the scope of this function. This means that the function will fail if these variables are not properly initialized before calling `get_location`.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the apartment numbers `a` and `b` are out of the valid range `[1, n·m·k]`. The `get_location` function assumes that the input apartment number is within the valid range, but the main function does not check this condition. If `a` or `b` are out of range, the `get_location` function will produce incorrect results, leading to an incorrect overall result.

These issues mean that the program does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
