Final: **True**

### Reasoning:

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to calculate the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Function `get_location`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the block and floor for a given apartment number, matching the problem's requirements. The annotations confirm that the function handles the calculation accurately.

2. **Main Function `func_1`**:
   - **Exit Time Calculation**:
     - If Edvard's apartment is on the first floor, the exit time is 0. Otherwise, it correctly calculates the time to exit using the lift.
     - The annotations confirm that this part of the logic is correct.
   - **Direct and Reverse Walk Time Calculation**:
     - Direct walk time: Calculates the minimum time to walk directly from Edvard’s block to Natasha’s block.
     - Reverse walk time: Calculates the minimum time to walk in the opposite direction around the building.
     - The annotations confirm that the logic here correctly accounts for the circular nature of the building and chooses the shortest path.
   - **Time to Target Floor**:
     - This correctly calculates the time needed to go from Edvard’s current floor to Natasha’s target floor by multiplying the difference between the floors by 5 seconds.
     - The annotations confirm that this part of the logic is correct.
   - **Total Time Calculation**:
     - Adds up all the times calculated above to get the total minimum time.
     - The annotations confirm that the total time calculation is correct.

Given that the functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and the annotations confirm the correctness of each step, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment remains **True**.
