Reasoning:

Let's break down the solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input values for \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), \( a \), and \( b \).

2. **Location Calculation**: 
   - The function `get_location` correctly calculates the block and floor for any given apartment number.
   - For apartment number \( \text{apartment} \):
     - Block is calculated as \( \left\lceil \frac{\text{apartment} - 1}{m \cdot k} \right\rceil + 1 \).
     - Floor within the block is calculated as \( \left( (\text{apartment} - 1) \mod (m \cdot k) \right) \div k + 1 \).
   - This ensures that the block and floor calculations are correct and match the given problem statement.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - **Exit Time**: If the current floor is 1, no exit time is needed. Otherwise, the time to exit is \( 10 + (\text{floor\_a} - 1) \).
   - **Walk Time**: The walk time can be either direct (clockwise) or reverse (counterclockwise) around the circular building. The time is calculated as \( 15 \times \min(\text{abs}(block\_a - block\_b) \% n, (n - \text{abs}(block\_a - block\_b)) \% n) \).
   - **Target Floor Time**: The time to reach the target floor is \( 5 \times (\text{floor\_b} - 1) \).
   - The total time is the sum of these three components.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the code appears to correctly compute the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natashaâ€™s apartment.

Therefore, after reviewing the logic and ensuring it aligns with the problem requirements, the solution seems accurate.

Correctness: **True**
