Final: **True**

### Reasoning:

Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for finding the minimum time for Edvard to reach Natasha's apartment. Here are the key points supporting this assessment:

1. **Function `get_location`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the block and floor for a given apartment number.
   - It handles the range validation implicitly through the input constraints provided in the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Exit Time Calculation**:
     - If the apartment of Edvard is on the first floor, the exit time is 0. Otherwise, it correctly calculates the time to exit the building using the lift.
   - **Direct and Reverse Walk Time Calculation**:
     - It correctly calculates the shortest path around the building by considering both direct and reverse walks.
   - **Time to Target Floor**:
     - It correctly calculates the time needed to go from Edvard’s current floor to Natasha’s target floor.
   - **Total Time Calculation**:
     - It sums up all the times to get the total minimum time.

The annotations provided in the code further support the correctness of the implementation. They clearly describe the state of the program at various points and ensure that each step aligns with the problem requirements.

Given that the functions handle all the necessary calculations and the logic matches the problem description, the original assessment remains accurate. Therefore, the final assessment is:

Final: **True**
