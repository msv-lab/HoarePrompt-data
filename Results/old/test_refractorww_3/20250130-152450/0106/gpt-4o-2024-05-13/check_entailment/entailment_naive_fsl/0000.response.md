Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. Let's break down the program:

1. **Function `get_location`**: This function correctly calculates the block and floor for a given apartment number.
2. **Main Function `func_1`**: 
   - It first retrieves the block and floor for both apartments.
   - It then calculates the time to exit the current apartment if needed (10 seconds for the elevator and 1 second per floor).
   - It calculates the minimum time to walk around the building to the target block (either directly or by going the other way).
   - It adds the time required to walk to the target floor using the stairs.
   - Finally, it returns the total time.

Given the examples and the problem description, the program handles all the necessary cases correctly. For instance:
- In the first example, the program correctly calculates the time for Edward to move from the 4th block, 10th floor to the 1st block, 2nd floor.
- In the second example, the program correctly calculates the time for Edward to move from the 2nd block, 1st floor to the 1st block, 1st floor by simply walking around the building.

Since the program correctly handles all the scenarios described in the problem statement and examples, it is considered correct.
