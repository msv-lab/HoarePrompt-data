To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given problem step-by-step.

1. The loop condition is `i < n + 1`. This means the loop will keep executing as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

2. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6
   - `MOD` is 998244353
   - `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1 and the remaining `n-1` elements as 0
   - `power_of_two` is a list with `n+1` elements where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, the third element is 4, and the `i`-th element is 8
   - `i` is 4
   
3. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to verify whether `i < n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4. To guarantee the loop can run again, `i` needs to be less than `n + 1`.

4. Since `i` is 4, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 4. This is already satisfied because `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6.

Since `n` is already within the correct range and `i` is currently less than `n + 1`, we do not need to adjust the state further. The loop can certainly execute one more time based on the given state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1 and the remaining `n-1` elements as 0, `power_of_two` is a list with `n+1` elements where the first element is 1, the second element is 2, the third element is 4, and the `i`-th element is 8, `i` is 4**
