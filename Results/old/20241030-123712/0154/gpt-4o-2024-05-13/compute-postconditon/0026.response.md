Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1 and the remaining `n-1` elements as 0 initially, `power_of_two` is a list with `n+1` elements where `power_of_two[i]` is equal to `2^i % MOD` for all `0 <= i <= n`, `i` is 4, `half` is 1. If (i - 1) % 2 == 0, then `dp[3]` is set to 2. Otherwise, `dp[3]` is set to 4.**
