`dp[1]` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state of `dp` is a list with the first element as `1` and the remaining `n` elements as `0`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1 and the remaining `n-1` elements as 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1 and the remaining `n-1` elements as 0**
