The function `func(n)` is called with `n` as an input integer, and its result is printed. Based on the initial state, the function `func(n)` returns:
- `1` if `n` equals `1`
- `0` if `n` equals `2`
- `dp[n] % 998244353` if `n` is greater than or equal to `3`

The exact value of `dp[n]` depends on the dynamic programming implementation which is not provided. Since `print` outputs the return value of `func(n)` to the standard output, the output state includes the value returned by `func(n)`.

Output State: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^6. For `n` equals 1, it returns 1. For `n` equals 2, it returns 0. For `n` >= 3, it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate and return `dp[n]` with a modulus of 998244353. For any other value of `n`, the behavior is undefined. The `input` is set to read from `sys.stdin`. `n` is an input integer and the function's return value is printed.**
