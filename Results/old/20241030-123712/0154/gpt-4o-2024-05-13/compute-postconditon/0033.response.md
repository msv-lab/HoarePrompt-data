According to the `while` loop condition, the loop will execute as long as `i < n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5 and `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 10^6`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Given `i` is 5, this means `n + 1` must be greater than 5, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 4. Since the initial condition already guarantees that `4 <= n <= 10^6`, no adjustments to `n` are necessary, as it already satisfies the condition for the loop to continue.

Thus, the program state remains the same and no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list with the first two elements as 1, the third element as 2 or 4 (depending on the condition), if `(i - 1) % 2 == 0` then `dp[4]` is set to `dp[1] * dp[1] * 2 % 998244353 = 2`, otherwise `dp[4]` is set to `dp[1] * dp[2] * 2 % 998244353 = 4`, `power_of_two` is a list with `n+1` elements where `power_of_two[i]` is equal to `2^i % MOD` for all `0 <= i <= n`, `i` is 5, `half` is 1**
