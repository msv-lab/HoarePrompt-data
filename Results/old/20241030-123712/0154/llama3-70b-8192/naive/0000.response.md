RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The provided code does not properly implement the logic necessary to count perfectly balanced striped binary search trees as described. The `dp` array and the nested loops don't correctly account for the conditions of striped trees or the specific requirements for balancing. The condition `((i - 1) // j % 2)` in the nested loop is incorrect and does not ensure the parity conditions or the balanced nature of the trees. The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to ensure both the perfect balance and the striped property, which this code does not achieve.
