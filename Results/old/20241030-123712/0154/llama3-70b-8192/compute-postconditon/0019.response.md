According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6. Since `n` is at least 1, `n + 1` is at least 2, which means the condition `i < n + 1` will be true for `i` being 2.

Since `i` is currently 2 and the loop condition is `i < n + 1`, the loop can certainly execute at least one more time given that `n` is at least 1. Hence, no adjustments to the state are necessary.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
