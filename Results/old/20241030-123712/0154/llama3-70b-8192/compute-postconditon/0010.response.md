Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is less than 0, `dp[1]` is updated to `dp[1] % MOD`, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] += 0` since `j` is less than 0, effectively not changing `dp[i]`, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] % MOD`**.
