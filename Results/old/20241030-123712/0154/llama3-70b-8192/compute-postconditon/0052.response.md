Given the provided code and its iterations, let's analyze the output state step by step, including any potential edge cases and missing logic.

### Loop Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 10^6`
   - `MOD` is `998244353`
   - `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is `1` and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`
   - `i` is `1`

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - Executes while `i < n + 1`

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - Executes while `j < 0`

### Observing the Inner Loop Condition:
The inner loop condition `j < 0` is never true initially since `j` is set to `i`, and `i` starts from `1`. Therefore, the inner loop will never execute.

### State After Each Outer Loop Iteration:
Given that the inner loop does not execute, the list `dp` remains unchanged except for the increment of `i`.

### Loop Execution Details:
**After 1 iteration:**
- `i` is incremented from `1` to `2`
- `dp` remains the same (with `dp[0]` as `1` and the rest zeros)

**After 2 iterations:**
- `i` is incremented from `2` to `3`
- `dp` remains the same

**After 3 iterations:**
- `i` is incremented from `3` to `4`
- `dp` remains the same

This pattern continues until `i` exceeds `n`.

### Conclusion:
Since the inner loop never executes, the values in `dp` do not change from their initial state. The only variable changing is `i`, which will eventually exceed `n`.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
- The inner loop condition `j < 0` ensures that the inner loop doesn't run, which might not be the intended logic for actual computations.
- If `n` is `0` or negative, the outer loop will not execute due to the condition `i < n + 1`.

### Output State:
```plaintext
Output State: **If n >= 1, `dp` remains a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` will be `n + 1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the list `dp` remains unchanged and `i` will remain 1.**
