Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step:

1. The loop condition is `while j < 0:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 0.
2. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6
   - `MOD` is 998244353
   - `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 3
   - `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % 998244353`

Given the current state, `j` is 3, which is not less than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to a value less than 0. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where dp[0] is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than 0, `dp[2]` is updated to `dp[2] % 998244353`**
