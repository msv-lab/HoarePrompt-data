Output State: **The function accepts an integer `n`. If `n >= 1`, it returns 0 but does not effectively utilize the initialized structures due to an ineffective loop condition. If `n` is 0, it correctly returns 1. If `n` is negative, an index error would occur as the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds index in the `dp` array. `n` is an input integer, and the function's return value is printed.**
