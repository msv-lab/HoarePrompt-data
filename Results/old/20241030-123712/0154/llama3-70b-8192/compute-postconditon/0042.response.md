`dp[i]` is assigned the value `dp[i] % MOD`, where `MOD` is 998244353 and `i` is 3. The previous value of `dp[3]` is `dp[3] + dp[3] * dp[0] * 1 % 998244353`, which simplifies to `dp[3] + dp[3] % 998244353`, as `dp[0]` is 1 and the other factors do not change the value. Therefore, `dp[3] %= MOD` does not change `dp[3]` since the value remains the same when taken modulo `MOD`. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, `MOD` is 998244353, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp[3]` which is `dp[3] + dp[3] % 998244353`, `i` is 3, `j` is less than 0, no change to `dp[i]` because `j` is less than 0**
