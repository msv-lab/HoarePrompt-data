`i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 4. So after execution, `i` becomes 5. The states of `puzzle1`, `puzzle2`, `x1`, and `x2` are not affected.

Output State: **The input consists of two 2Ã—2 grids (each represented as two lines of strings) where each grid contains exactly one of each character 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If `puzzle1[4]` is 'X', then `x1` is set to 4. If `puzzle2[4]` is 'X', then `x2` is set to 4. `i` is 5.**
