Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`, which are intended to be 2Ã—2 grids represented as two lines of strings containing exactly one of each character 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. It attempts to swap the positions of 'X' in both grids, then returns whether the sorted versions of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are equal. However, there are several issues: 1) The loop checks if `i` is less than 0, which will never execute since `i` starts at 4, thus `x1` and `x2` will not be correctly set. 2) There is no validation that the input strings are exactly 4 characters and contain the required characters. 3) The function does not handle cases where 'X' is not found in one or both grids.**
