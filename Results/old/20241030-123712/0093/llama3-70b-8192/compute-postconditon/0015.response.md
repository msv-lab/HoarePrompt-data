Output State: **The input consists of two 2Ã—2 grids (each represented as two lines of strings) where each grid contains exactly one of each character 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If `puzzle1[4]` is 'X', then `x1` is set to 4. If `puzzle2[4]` is 'X', then `x2` is set to 4. `i` is less than 0. If `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', then `x1` is set to the value of `i`, which is less than 0. If `puzzle2[i]` is 'X', then `x2` is set to the value of `i`, which is less than 0. If `puzzle1[i]` is 'X', then `x1` is set to `i`. `x2` is set to `i`, which is less than 0.**
