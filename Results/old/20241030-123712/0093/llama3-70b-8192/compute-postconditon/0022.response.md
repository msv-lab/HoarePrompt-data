The function `func` accepts two parameters, `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. Both parameters are 2×2 grids, each represented as two lines of strings, where each grid contains exactly one of each character 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. The function processes these grids by identifying the position of the character 'X' in both grids and then swapping these positions between the two grids. After swapping, the function checks if the sorted versions of `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are equal and returns the result of this comparison.
