RESULT: **Incorrect**

Explanation: The function `is_bffl` checks if the sorted lists of the puzzle configurations are equal after swapping the positions of the empty cells ('X'). However, this approach is flawed because it only checks if both puzzles contain the same tiles, not whether they can reach the same configuration through valid moves. Sorting the puzzles disregards the positions of the tiles, thus not correctly determining if the puzzles can reach the same configuration.
