Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly follows the steps to determine the k-th digit in an infinite sequence of concatenated positive integers. Here's why it works for every case:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `length = 1`: Starts with digit places (1-digit numbers).
   - `count = 9`: There are 9 1-digit numbers (1 to 9).
   - `start = 1`: The sequence starts from number 1.

2. **Finding the Range**:
   - The `while` loop decreases `k` by the number of digits in the current range (1-digit, 2-digit, etc.) until `k` falls within the current number length range.
   - For example, if `k` is 21, it first subtracts the 9 digits of the 1-digit numbers (9 * 1 = 9), then it subtracts the 180 digits of the 2-digit numbers (90 * 2 = 180) if necessary, and so on.

3. **Determining the Exact Number and Digit**:
   - `number = start + (k - 1) // length`: This calculates the exact number in which the k-th digit lies.
   - `digit_index = (k - 1) % length`: This calculates the exact position of the digit within that number.
   - For `k = 21`, after the loop, `k` falls into the range of 2-digit numbers. The calculation would identify the exact number and the digit within that number.

4. **Extracting the Digit**:
   - The program converts the number to a string and extracts the required digit using the `digit_index`.

The code handles all edge cases correctly, including very large values of `k` up to \(10^{12}\), due to efficient logarithmic-like steps in reducing `k` and identifying the range using simple arithmetic operations. There are no infinite loops or missed digits in any possible `k` value within the given constraints.
