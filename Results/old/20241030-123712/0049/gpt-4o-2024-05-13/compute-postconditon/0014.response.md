The value of `k` is decreased by `length * count`, where `length` is 3 and `count` is 900. Therefore, `length * count` is `3 * 900` which equals `2700`. The new value of `k` is (input integer minus 189) minus 2700.

Output State: **`k` is (input integer minus 2889), `length` is 3, `count` is 900, `start` is 100**
