Given that the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary to ensure the loop executes one more time. You can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`k` is (input integer - 1), `n` is 2, `s` is "1"**
