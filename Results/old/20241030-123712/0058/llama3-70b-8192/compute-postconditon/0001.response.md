`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `b` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n**
