The variable `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding a specific calculated value based on the current values of `k` and `n`. 

1. The expression `(10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2))` simplifies to `9 * 10 ** (k - 2)` because it represents the difference between powers of 10.
2. The term `(n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)` calculates how many times `10 ** (k - 1)` fits into `n`, subtracting 1 from that count.
3. The overall impact on `dp[n, k]` depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 1, contributions from this expression get added to the existing value of `dp[n, k]`, which initially accounts for contributions from previous iterations; if `k` equals 1, `dp[n, k]` remains 9.

Since the initial state specifies that `dp[n, k]` starts at 9 plus contributions from other iterations, the final value will depend on the calculations above.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated based on contributions calculated from (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)**
