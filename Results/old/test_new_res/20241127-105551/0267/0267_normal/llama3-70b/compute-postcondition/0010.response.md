According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 2, as the range for `i` starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `k`. Since `dp[n, k]` has a value of 9 and the pair `(n, k)` is present in the `dp` collection, we don't need to adjust `dp[n, k]`. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 2, and at the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is 9, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
