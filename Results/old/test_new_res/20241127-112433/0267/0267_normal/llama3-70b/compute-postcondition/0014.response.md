According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 3, and `i` will be increased by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 3.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10; `i` is 3; `dp[n, k]` is increased by `90 * (10`**
