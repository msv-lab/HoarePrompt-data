The operation `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` involves the variable `dp[n, k]`. 

1. `i` is 3, so `10 ** (i - 1)` equals `10 ** 2`, which is `100`.
2. The expression `10 ** (k - i)` represents `10 ** (k - 3)`, where `k` is between 4 and 10 inclusive.
3. The term `10 ** (k - 3) - 10 ** (2)` becomes `10 ** (k - 3) - 100`.

This whole formula calculates an increment to `dp[n, k]` based on the difference of powers of 10 and the constant multiplier of `9`.

Since the specific values of `dp[n, k]`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, the output state must reflect that `dp[n, k]` is increased without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is increased by `90 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`**
