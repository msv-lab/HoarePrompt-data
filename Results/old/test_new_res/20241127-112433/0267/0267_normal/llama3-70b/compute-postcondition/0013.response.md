To analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial state, we focus on the expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`.

1. The variable `i` is 2.
2. The expression simplifies to `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (2 - 1) * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10 ** (2 - 1))`.
3. Thus, `10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** 1`, which is 10.
4. The term `10 ** (k - i)` becomes `10 ** (k - 2)`.
5. The term `10 ** (2 - 1)` is also 10.
6. Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as: `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`.
7. This indicates that the value of `dp[n, k]` is increased by the product of `9 * 10` and the difference between `10 ** (k - 2)` and `10`.

The rest of the variables `l`, `r`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. The output state summarizes the calculated effect on `dp[n, k]`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10; `i` is 2; `dp[n, k]` is increased by `90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`**
