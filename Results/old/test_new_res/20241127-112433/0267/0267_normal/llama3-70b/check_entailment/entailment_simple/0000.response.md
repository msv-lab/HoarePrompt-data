To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and functionality.

### Problem Description Summary:
- We need to calculate the sum of integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that each have at most `k` different digits.
- The result should be printed modulo `998244353`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function Structure**:
   - The function `func_1(l, r, k)` is designed to call a helper function `count(n, k, dp)` twice:
     - `count(r, k, dp)` to count valid numbers up to `r`.
     - `count(l - 1, k, dp)` to count valid numbers up to `l-1`.
   - The difference between these two results will give the count of valid numbers in the range `[l, r]`.

2. **Counting Logic**:
   - The `count(n, k, dp)` function is intended to compute the count of integers up to `n` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - If `n < 10^k`, it directly returns `n`, which is logically correct because all numbers below `10^k` can have at most `k` different digits.
   - The program uses some form of dynamic programming (via `dp` dictionary) to cache results, which is efficient for ranges of large size.

3. **Missing Summation**:
   - However, the provided program computes the count of valid numbers but does not compute their sum. The problem description specifically asks for the sum of these numbers, not just their count.
   - The logic within the `count` function seems only focused on counting how many numbers meet the digit condition, not accumulating their values.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The last return statement in `func_1` only returns a count, rather than the sum of the valid numbers. This is directly contrary to what the problem description requires.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to meet the primary requirement of the problem description because it does not calculate the sum of the numbers in the specified range that meet the digit condition. Instead, it merely counts how many such numbers exist, which does not fulfill the requirement.

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
