Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to find common characters between two input strings `a` and `b`, but it has a critical flaw. Specifically, it does not handle the case where characters in the two strings are not in the same order. 

For example, consider the following inputs:

```
a = "abc"
b = "cba"
```

The expected output should be the common characters in the order they appear in one of the strings, which is `"c"` (the only common character). However, the program will output `'-'` because it only adds characters to `ans` if they match in the same sequential order, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill its intended purpose correctly in all cases, leading to an overall correctness of **False**.
