Correctness: **False**

The provided program appears to check if the extra spheres of different colors can compensate for the deficits of another set of spheres. However, there is a fundamental flaw in the logic when considering the calculation of `extra_spheres`. The code assumes that only pairs of extra spheres can be used to compensate for deficits, as indicated by the division by 2 when calculating `extra_spheres`. 

For example, if there is an excess of 1 blue sphere and a deficit of 1 blue sphere, the program would incorrectly determine that the extra sphere is not usable (since 1 // 2 equals 0). Consequently, it would not correctly account for cases where a single extra sphere can match a single deficit sphere, resulting in a misleading output.

For instance, if the input is:
```
1 1 1
0 0 0
```
The output would be 'No', even though there is 1 extra sphere to compensate for the 1 deficit across the same color. 

Therefore, the program fails to handle this situation correctly, indicating a flaw in its logic.
