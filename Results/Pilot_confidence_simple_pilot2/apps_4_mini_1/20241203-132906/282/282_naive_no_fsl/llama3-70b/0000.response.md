Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to compute a specific value based on the inputs `a` and `b`, but it seems to be performing the operation `func_1(b) // func_1(a)` which calculates the factorial of `b` divided by the factorial of `a`. This is equivalent to `b! / a!` which simplifies to the product of integers from `a+1` to `b`.

However, there are several potential issues with this approach:

1. If `a` is greater than `b`, the computation `func_1(b) // func_1(a)` will not be defined in the context of combinations or arrangements, as you cannot have a larger factorial divided by a smaller factorial in this manner. For valid values of `a` and `b` where `a > b`, this will produce an incorrect result.

2. The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are negative integers. Factorials are not defined for negative integers, and as such, calling `func_1` with negative values will lead to an infinite loop.

3. There's no check for whether `a` and `b` are valid integers in the range expected for the factorial computation.

For example, if we input `3 2`, the output will be `0` which is not correct based on the intended mathematical operation. Similarly, if we input `-1 2`, the program will enter an infinite loop.

Since the program fails in multiple cases, it cannot be considered correct.
