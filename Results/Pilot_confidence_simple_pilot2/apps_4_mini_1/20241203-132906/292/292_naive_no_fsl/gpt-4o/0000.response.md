Correctness: **False**

The program appears to intend to calculate the number of years it takes for a population (represented by `a`) to exceed another population (represented by `b`), given that `a` triples and `b` doubles each year. However, the program does not handle the case where either `a` or `b` is initially negative or zero. Specifically, if `a` is 0 or a negative number, the loop will either not execute or could lead to infinite looping, as `a` will never exceed `b`. 

For example, if the input is:

```
0 5
```

The program will output `0`, which is misleading, as it implies that `0` can eventually exceed `5`, which is not possible. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the expected behavior described in the problem statement for all potential cases.
