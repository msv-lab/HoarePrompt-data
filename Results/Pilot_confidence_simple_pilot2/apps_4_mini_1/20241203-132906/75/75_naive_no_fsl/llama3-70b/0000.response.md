Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to find prime numbers less than a given integer `n` and determine if `n` can be expressed as the sum of 1, 2, or 3 prime numbers. However, there are several issues with the program:

1. **Input Handling**: If `n` is less than 2, the program does not handle this case properly. The `func_1` function will return `False` for any number less than 2, and the program will not output anything in this situation.

2. **Missing Outputs for Certain Cases**: If `n` is a prime number and greater than 2, the program will correctly identify it as `k = 1`. However, if `n` is a composite number or cannot be represented as the sum of 1, 2, or 3 primes, the program will terminate without any output, leading to confusion.

3. **Edge Cases**: If `n` is an even number greater than 2, it may have multiple representations as the sum of two primes (Goldbach's conjecture). The program only prints the first found representation, which may not be sufficient depending on the requirements.

4. **Efficiency**: Though not directly related to correctness, the approach of checking combinations of primes is inefficient for larger values of `n`. 

For example:
- If the input is `1`, the program does not print anything.
- If the input is `4`, it will output `k = 2` with `p1 = 2` and `p2 = 2`, which is correct. However, if `n` is `5`, it will output `k = 1` with `p1 = 5`, but if `n` is `6`, it will output `k = 2` with `p1 = 3` and `p2 = 3`. If `n` is `7`, it outputs `k = 1` with `p1 = 7`. This can lead to confusion regarding whether all cases for sums of prime numbers are correctly handled.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements in all potential cases, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
