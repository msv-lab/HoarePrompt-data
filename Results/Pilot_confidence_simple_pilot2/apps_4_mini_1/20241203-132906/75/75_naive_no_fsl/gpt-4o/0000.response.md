Correctness: **False**

The provided program is designed to check for prime numbers and, based on that, determine if a given number can be expressed as a sum of 1, 2, or 3 prime numbers. However, there are several issues and edge cases that the program does not handle correctly.

1. **Handling of Even Numbers**: The program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is an even number greater than 2. For instance, if `n = 4`, it should return `(2, [2, 2])`, but it will not handle this correctly because when it checks `func_1(n - 2)` (which would check `func_1(2)`), it is not clear if it will correctly find that two 2's can sum to 4.

2. **Return Value**: The program returns `None` if no valid combination of prime numbers is found, but it also needs to return `-1` for cases that are not covered. The logic for returning `-1` when no combinations exist is not streamlined for all cases.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not account for the case when `n` is less than 1 or when it's odd and greater than 2. For example, if `n = 1` or `n = 0`, the response is not clearly defined.

4. **No Handling for Other Combinations**: The primary logic only checks sums of three primes but does not handle all cases accurately. If `n` is small or a specific odd number like 7, the combinations may not be fully explored in all situations.

Overall, due to these shortcomings and the potential for incorrect results in specific cases such as the ones discussed, the program does not meet the requirements as expected in the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
