Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the initial average of the marks is already greater than or equal to `k`. In such a case, the program enters an infinite loop since it continuously adds `k` to the `current_sum` without ever checking if it should terminate. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 5
5 6 7
```
Here, the initial average is `(5 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 6`, which is greater than `k = 5`. The program should immediately output `0` because no additional elements are needed. However, due to the infinite loop, it will not produce any output and will continue running indefinitely.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
