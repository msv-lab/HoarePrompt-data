Correctness: **False**

The program checks if the sum of the elements in list `y` is greater than the sum of the elements in list `x`, and prints 'No' if it is, otherwise it prints 'Yes'. 

However, the problem description is missing, and without it, we cannot confirm if the logic implemented in the program aligns with the intended requirements. 

One potential issue is that there are no constraints or expected behaviors provided for edge cases. For example:
- If `x` and `y` are both empty (i.e., `n = 0`), then `total_x` and `total_y` would both be `0`, leading to an output of 'Yes', but we don't know if this is the correct behavior without further context.
- If the input lists contain negative numbers, the logic may not handle certain scenarios correctly according to the unknown requirements. 

Therefore, we cannot guarantee the correctness of the program due to the ambiguous problem description and the potential for unhandled cases.
