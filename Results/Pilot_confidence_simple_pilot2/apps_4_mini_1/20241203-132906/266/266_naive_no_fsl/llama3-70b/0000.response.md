Correctness: **False**

The provided program has logic for selecting two pizzas such that the maximum number of friends are pleased, and in case of a tie, it selects the pair with the minimum cost. However, the program does not handle the edge cases where:

1. There are no friends (i.e., `n = 0`). In this case, the program should perhaps return two indices or some indication that there are no friends to please.
2. There is only one pizza (`m = 1`). The nested loops for selecting two pizzas would not execute, and the program would return the initial value of `ans`, which is `(-1, -1)`, indicating no valid selection was made.

For example:
- Input: 
```
0 2
```
Expected Output: No output or indication, but the program gives `-1 -1` as output, which is misleading.
  
- Input:
```
3 1
1 3
1 2
1 1
1 1
```
Expected Output: Should indicate a scenario for one pizza available for selecting but results in -1 -1.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle cases where there are no friends or only one pizza, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
