Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(n, m, k)` is designed to find the k-th smallest number in the multiplication table of size `n` by `m`. It uses a binary search approach to efficiently count how many numbers in the multiplication table are less than or equal to a certain value.

### Reasoning:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The function uses a binary search between the range of 1 and `n*m`, correctly narrowing down to find the k-th smallest number.
2. **Counting Function**: The inner function `count_less_equal(x)` counts how many numbers in the multiplication table are less than or equal to `x`. This is done correctly by iterating through rows from 1 to `n` and adding the minimum of `x // i` and `m`, ensuring the count does not exceed `m` (the maximum number in any row).
3. **Edge Cases**: The program seems to handle edge cases such as:
   - If `k` is 1, it will correctly return the smallest number in the table, which is 1.
   - If `k` is equal to `n * m`, it will return the largest number, which is `n * m`.
   - It also manages scenarios where `n` or `m` is at its minimum value (1).

Since the function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described (finding the k-th smallest number in a multiplication table) and handles edge cases appropriately, I could not identify any scenario where it fails. Hence, the program is correct.

Therefore, the final assessment is:
Correctness: **True**
