Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to convert a number represented in a base `n` (read as a string `k`) into its decimal equivalent. However, it does not handle the case where the input base `n` is less than or equal to the maximum digit present in the string `k`. 

For example, if `n` is `2` and `k` is `"10"`, the code will correctly interpret this as the decimal number `2`. However, if `n` is `2` and `k` is `"3"`, the program will try to interpret the digit `3` in base `2`, which is not a valid digit for that base. This will cause a `ValueError` when trying to convert the character `c` to an integer in the line `x += int(c) * n ** i`.

Thus, the program does not account for invalid input based on the base, which shows that it is incorrect.
