Correctness: **False**

The program appears to be trying to calculate a combinatorial value based on the inputs `n`, `x`, and `pos`. However, there are several potential issues:

1. **Input Constraints**: The code does not handle cases where `x` is greater than `n`, which would not make sense in a combinatorial context (as you cannot choose more elements than available). If `x` > `n`, the program should ideally return `0` or raise an error.

2. **Valid Position Check**: The code assumes that `pos` is a valid index within the range `0` to `n-1`. If `pos` is out of this range, the calculations would be incorrect. There should be checks to ensure that `pos` is a valid position.

3. **Mathematical Logic**: The combination logic used in the function `func_1` does not handle the cases where `k` is `0`. The combination of choosing `0` items from `n` items is always `1`, but this is not explicitly handled in the implementation. 

4. **Integer Division**: The use of `//` operator could potentially lead to incorrect calculations in cases where the intermediate calculations are not whole numbers. This is particularly critical when calculating combinations.

In summary, due to the lack of input validation and handling of edge cases, the code will not work correctly for all possible inputs, leading to cases of failure.
