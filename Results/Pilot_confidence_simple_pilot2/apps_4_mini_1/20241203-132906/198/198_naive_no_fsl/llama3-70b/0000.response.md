Correctness: **False**

The provided program appears to calculate a result based on an array of pairs of integers. However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation that will cause it to produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Consider the following test case:

```plaintext
n = 1
a = [[1, 1]]
```

In this scenario, the outer loop will run once (i = 0). The inner loop will not run at all since `j` starts from `i + 1`, which is 1, and `n` is also 1. Therefore, `cnt` will remain 1.

Next, we compute `res`:

```plaintext
res = func_1(res, func_3(a[0][1] - a[0][0] + 1))
```

Here, `a[0][1] - a[0][0] + 1` results in `1 - 1 + 1 = 1`, hence `func_3(1)` will compute `func_2(1, MOD - 2)`, which is the modular inverse of 1 under the modulus `998244353`. 

1. The function `func_2(1, MOD - 2)` will return 1 because raising 1 to any power is still 1, and the multiplicative inverse of 1 is 1.

Now, `res` will be:

```plaintext
res = func_1(1, 1) which is 1
```

The program will print `1`.

However, if we change the input slightly:

```plaintext
n = 2
a = [[1, 2], [2, 3]]
```

The program would incorrectly calculate `cnt` values and might yield an incorrect result for complex scenarios involving overlapping intervals or varying ranges, as it only counts the intervals without proper checks on the overlaps and fails to consider edge cases.

Due to this logic flaw, I conclude that the program does not handle all edge cases and can produce incorrect results under certain inputs.

Hence, the overall correctness evaluation is **False**.
