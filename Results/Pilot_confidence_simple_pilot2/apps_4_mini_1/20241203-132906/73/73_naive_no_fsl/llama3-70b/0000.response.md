Correctness: **False**

The logic in the program has flaws that prevent it from correctly determining the "winner" between Kuro, Shiro, and Katie based on the beauty values calculated from their respective inputs. 

One potential case where the program would not work correctly is when two or more players have the same maximum beauty value. The current implementation only prints "Draw" if the maximum beauty is held by more than one player without specifying the players' names. However, it could be misleading since if two players have the same maximum beauty, the program does not clearly indicate who is the actual winner.

For example, consider the following inputs:
```
n = 5
kuro = "abcab"
shiro = "abcab"
katie = "abc"
```
In this case, both Kuro and Shiro would compute the same maximum beauty value, leading to a "Draw" output. However, the problem description may imply that there should be a clear winner among the players based on their beauty values, which this implementation fails to establish.

Therefore, the program is not correctly handling all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
