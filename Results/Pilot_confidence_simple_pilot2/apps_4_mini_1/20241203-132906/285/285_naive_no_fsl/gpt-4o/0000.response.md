Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to check if a given amount `n` can be exactly matched by purchasing houses, cars, and computers with fixed costs. However, it has several issues:

1. The program does not handle cases where `n` is less than the cost of the cheapest item (a computer). If `n` is less than 1234, the program will always return 'NO', which may not be the intended behavior if the problem description allows purchasing of only computers.

2. The program only considers combinations of houses, cars, and computers in a very specific way, but it does not account for the scenario where a combination of only computers could exactly equal `n`, without needing to buy houses or cars.

3. The looping is based on integer division, but if `n` is not large enough to buy any houses or cars, it should still consider the case where only computers might be bought.

For example, if `n = 1234`, the program will return 'YES' because you can buy one computer, but if `n = 1233`, it will return 'NO' even though the input is valid. 

Therefore, the implementation has logical flaws and does not handle all potential cases correctly.
