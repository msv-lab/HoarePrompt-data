Correctness: **False**

Reasoning: The program appears to aim to find two distinct integers from the input list that each occur exactly half the length of the list (`n // 2`). However, it assumes that there will always be two distinct numbers fulfilling this condition when the input size is even. Here are a few edge cases where the program would fail:

1. If `n` is an odd number, `n // 2` would not yield a whole number, making it impossible for any integer to occur exactly half the time. For example, if `n = 3` and the inputs are `1, 1, 1`, the program will incorrectly output "NO" even though there are not two numbers meeting the condition.

2. If `n` is even but there are not exactly two distinct integers that both appear `n // 2` times. For instance, if `n = 4` and inputs are `1, 1, 2, 2`, the program will correctly output "YES" with `1` and `2`. However, if the inputs are `1, 1, 1, 2`, the program will output "NO", which is correct. But if the inputs are `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`, the program may fail to identify that there are not exactly two integers occurring `n // 2` times.

Thus, the logic does not correctly ensure the conditions specified in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
