Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to find the minimum distance between indices of the minimum value in an array. However, there are several potential issues:

1. **Single Occurrence of Minimum Value**: If the minimum value occurs only once in the list, the program will attempt to compute the distance using `min_indices[i + 1] - min_indices[i]`, which will raise an `IndexError` because `len(min_indices) - 1` will be `0`, and accessing `min_indices[0]` will not have a `next` element.

2. **Empty Input**: If the input list is empty, the program will also raise a `ValueError` when trying to compute `min(arr)` since there are no elements to find a minimum.

3. **Non-Integer Inputs**: If the input is not strictly integers (e.g., strings or floats), the `map(int, input().split())` will fail.

These cases highlight that the current implementation does not handle all possible input scenarios as expected, leading to incorrect outputs or runtime errors. This confirms that the program is not reliable for all potential cases.
