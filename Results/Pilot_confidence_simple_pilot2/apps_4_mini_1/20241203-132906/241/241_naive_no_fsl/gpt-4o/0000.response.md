Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to generate possible numbers from a string `s` by removing a substring `sub` and finding the smallest permutation of the remaining characters. However, there are several potential issues that could lead to incorrect behavior:

1. **Edge Case with Insufficient Characters**: If `sub` contains more characters than `s`, the program will produce an empty list of possible numbers, which will cause a `ValueError` when trying to find the minimum of an empty sequence. For example, calling `func_1("123", "456")` would raise an error.

2. **Handling of Duplicate Permutations**: The program uses permutations to generate possible combinations of the remaining characters. However, if there are duplicate characters in `s`, it may lead to incorrect results because permutations can generate duplicate sequences, which could affect the minimum calculation.

3. **Validation Logic**: The validation function `is_valid_number` checks if `sub` is in `num_str` and that the length of `num_str` matches the adjusted length (`n_len`). This could lead to incorrect results since it doesn't ensure that all characters from `sub` are accounted for in `num_str` before checking.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The program does not handle cases where `s` or `sub` can be empty strings, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Due to these issues, particularly the potential for a `ValueError` when inputs are not aligned in size, the program does not meet the correctness criteria specified.
