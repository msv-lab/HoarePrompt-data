Correctness: **False**

The program checks if the area computed as `n * m / k` is an integer and is greater than zero. However, it does not handle the case when `k` is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error. This is a critical edge case that needs to be addressed, as it could cause the program to crash.

For example, if the input is:
```
5 5 0
```
The program will attempt to execute `area = n * m / k`, resulting in a division by zero, which will raise an exception and stop the program from running as expected. 

Thus, the program is not correct because it does not handle this potential case properly.
