`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. The value of `sep` is `' '`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `x` is the next element in `args`; a space character is written to `file`.

Output State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `x` is the next element in `args`; a space character is written to `file`.**
