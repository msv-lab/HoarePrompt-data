`file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`. Since `kwargs` is an empty dictionary, calling `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` will return the second argument `\n` because the key `'end'` does not exist in `kwargs`. After this operation, `kwargs` remains an empty dictionary.

Therefore, the code writes `\n` to `file`.

Output State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `\n` has been written to `file`.**
