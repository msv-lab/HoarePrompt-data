`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the output buffer of `file`. Since `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, this operation ensures that any buffered data is written to the standard output. The value of `kwargs`, `sep`, and `\n` being written to `file` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is in the state of `file`, which now has its buffer flushed.

Output State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout` with its buffer flushed, and `\n` has been written to `file`.**
