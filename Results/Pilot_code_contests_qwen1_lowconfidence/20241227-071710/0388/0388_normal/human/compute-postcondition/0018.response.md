`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. Since `at_start` was already `False`, this assignment does not change its value. The states of the other variables (`kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, and the content of `file`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `file` contains `' ' followed by `str(x)`**
