The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `i`, and `ca`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\).
- `i` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq 10^8\).
- `ca` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a unique integer from the input array and its frequency, sorted by the unique integer.

The function also has a derived value `md`, which is an integer calculated as the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into `i` bytes, determined by the formula `int(2 ** i)`.

Case_1: The function returns the value of `md`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `i`, and `ca`, and return the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into `i` bytes, calculated as `int(2 ** i)`.
