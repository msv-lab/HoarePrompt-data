Output State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and a string representation of all elements in `args` has been written to `sys.stdout` with each element separated by a space `' '` except for the last one.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `kwargs` is an empty dictionary.
   - `sep` is `' '`.
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `args`.
   - On the first iteration, `at_start` is `True`. Since `at_start` is `True`, no separator is written initially. After writing the first element, `at_start` is set to `False`.
   - For subsequent iterations, since `at_start` is `False`, a separator (`sep`) is written before each element (except the last one).

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `at_start` remains `False`.
   - A string representation of each element in `args` has been written to `sys.stdout`.
   - Each element (except the last one) is separated by the value of `sep`, which is `' '`.

4. **Case where the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `args` is an empty list, the loop does not execute. In this case, `at_start` will still be `True`, and `kwargs`, `sep`, and `file` will retain their initial values.

Thus, the final output state after the loop has executed is that `kwargs` remains an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and all elements of `args` have been concatenated with a space separator, except for the last one, which is written directly without a trailing space.
