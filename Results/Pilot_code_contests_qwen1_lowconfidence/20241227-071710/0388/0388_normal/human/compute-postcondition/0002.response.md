The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. This is a new assignment and does not affect the values of `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `at_start` and retains the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
