The provided code does not contain any executable statements. It is a docstring explaining the functionality of a function that would print values to a stream or `sys.stdout` by default. Since there are no executable statements, no variables are modified, and the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The function does not use the provided arguments in its implementation, and thus the variables `args` and `kwargs` are empty.**
