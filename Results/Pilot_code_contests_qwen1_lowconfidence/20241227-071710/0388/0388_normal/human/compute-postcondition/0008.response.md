The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and a string representation of `x` has been written to `sys.stdout`.**
