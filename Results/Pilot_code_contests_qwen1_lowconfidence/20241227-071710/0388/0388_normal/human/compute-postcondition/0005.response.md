The code writes the value of `sep` to `file`. Since `sep` is `' '`, it writes a space to `sys.stdout`. The other variables (`kwargs`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` must have at least one element, a space has been written to `sys.stdout`**
