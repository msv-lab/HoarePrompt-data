Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `i`, and `ca`. Here's what it does step-by-step:

1. It reads two integers `n` and `i` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5` and `1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8`.
2. It reads a list of integers from the input, calculates the frequency of each unique integer, and sorts the list of tuples containing unique integers and their frequencies.
3. It calculates `md`, which is the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into `i` bytes, using the formula `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`.
4. It computes a prefix sum array `pref` where `pref[j]` is the cumulative sum of frequencies up to the `j-th` unique integer.
5. It iterates through the prefix sums to find the minimum value of `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for `i` ranging from `0` to `len(pref) - md - 1`. This essentially finds the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to ensure that no more than `md` distinct values remain.
6. If the length of `pref` minus `md` is less than or equal to `0`, it sets `s` to `0`.
7. Finally, it calls `func_2(s)`, passing the computed value of `s`.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is `1`, the function will directly return the result of the computation without entering the for loop.
- If `md` is greater than or equal to the length of `pref`, the value of `s` will be set to `0`.

Missing functionality:
- The code assumes that `ca` is always non-empty and has at least `md + 1` elements. However, if `ca` has fewer than `md + 1` elements, the loop might attempt to access indices out of bounds. This should be handled to prevent potential errors.**

The function's final state after executing is that it calls `func_2(s)`, where `s` is either the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure no more than `md` distinct values remain, or `0` if the length of `pref` is less than or equal to `md`. The original values of `n` and `ca` are unchanged, and `pref` contains the prefix sums.**
