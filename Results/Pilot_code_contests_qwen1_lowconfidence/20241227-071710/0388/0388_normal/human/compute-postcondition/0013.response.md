`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which it already was. Therefore, no changes occur to the variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and a string representation of `x` is written to `sys.stdout`.**
