Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `kwargs` is an empty dictionary.
   - `sep` is `' '` (a space).
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is `False`.
   - A string representation of `x` is written to `sys.stdout`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `args` list.
   - For each `x` in `args`, a string representation of `x` is written to `sys.stdout`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was processed and its string representation was written to `sys.stdout`.
   - The loop needs to proceed to the next element in `args`.
   - Since `at_start` is `False` at the end of the previous iteration, it indicates that this is not the first iteration.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `kwargs` remains unchanged as no modification is indicated.
   - `sep` remains `' '` as no modification is indicated.
   - `file` remains `sys.stdout` as no modification is indicated.
   - `at_start` should be updated to `False` because we are not starting a new iteration; instead, we are continuing with the next element in `args`.

6. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `kwargs` is still an empty dictionary.
   - `sep` is still `' '`.
   - `file` is still `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is now `False` (since we are not at the start of a new iteration).

**State: **`kwargs` is an empty dictionary, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`**.
