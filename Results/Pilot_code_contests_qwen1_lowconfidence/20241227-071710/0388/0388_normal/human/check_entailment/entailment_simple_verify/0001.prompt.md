You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One common way of digitalizing sound is to record sound intensity at particular time moments. For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of n non-negative integers.

If there are exactly K distinct values in the array, then we need k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ bits to store each value. It then takes nk bits to store the whole file.

To reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers l ≤ r, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range [l;r], we don't change it. If it is less than l, we change it to l; if it is greater than r, we change it to r. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.

Your task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size I bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.

We remind you that 1 byte contains 8 bits.

k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ is the smallest integer such that K ≤ 2^{k}. In particular, if K = 1, then k = 0.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and I (1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^{5}, 1 ≤ I ≤ 10^{8}) — the length of the array and the size of the disk in bytes, respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the array denoting the sound file.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal possible number of changed elements.

Examples

Input


6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


2


Input


6 2
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


0


Input


6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3


Output


2

Note

In the first example we can choose l=2, r=3. The array becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3, the number of distinct elements is K=2, and the sound file fits onto the disk. Only two values are changed.

In the second example the disk is larger, so the initial file fits it and no changes are required.

In the third example we have to change both 1s or both 3s.

from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, i) = map(int, input().split())

    md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))
    pref = [0]
    for (_, j) in ca:
        pref.append(pref[-1] + j)
    s = n
    for i in range(len(pref) - md):
        u = pref[i + md] - pref[i]
        s = min(s, n - u)
    if len(pref) - md <= 0:
        s = 0
    func_2(s)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the compression algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the minimal possible number of changed elements to fit the sound file into the given disk size.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Calculation of `md`:**
   ```python
   md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))
   ```
   This line calculates the maximum number of distinct values that can be stored in the given disk size. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that each value needs `k` bits, where `k` is the ceiling of `log2(K)`. Instead, it assumes each value requires 8 bits, which is not always true.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimal Changes:**
   The logic used to find the minimal number of changes is flawed. It sorts the unique values and their counts, then tries to find a segment of the array with a length equal to `md` to minimize changes. This approach does not guarantee the minimal number of changes needed to fit the file into the disk size.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   Let's consider an example to demonstrate the failure:
   - Input:
     ```
     6 1
     2 1 2 3 4 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2
     ```
   - Actual Output (using the provided code):
     The code does not produce the correct output. It might not correctly handle the case where the number of distinct values needs to be reduced to fit the disk size.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly calculate `k` and then find the minimal number of changes to fit the file into the disk size while ensuring the number of distinct values does not exceed \(2^k\).

Since the provided code does not meet the requirements and fails to produce the correct output for some cases, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
