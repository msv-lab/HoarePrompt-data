Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the task as described. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads `n` and `i` and a list of integers.
   - It calculates `md` which is supposed to be the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into `i` bytes. However, the calculation `md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))` is incorrect. The formula should be `md = int(2 ** (8 * i // n))` to ensure the result is an integer.
   - The function then sorts the frequencies of unique integers and calculates a prefix sum array `pref`.
   - It iterates through the prefix sums to find the minimum number of changes needed to fit within `i` bytes. However, the logic to calculate `s` (the minimum number of changes) is flawed. The variable `s` should be updated correctly based on the prefix sums, but the current implementation does not reflect the actual logic required to minimize changes.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is used to print the result. While it handles printing with customizable separators and other options, it does not affect the main logic of the program.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the minimal number of changes needed to fit the sound file into the specified disk size. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
