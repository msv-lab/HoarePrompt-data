Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of changed elements while ensuring the sound file fits within the given disk size. Specifically, the program calculates `md` as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`, which is intended to determine the maximum number of distinct values allowed based on the disk size. However, the logic for determining the minimum number of changes needed is flawed.

Here's a specific counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3
```

According to the problem description, the goal is to find the minimum number of changes needed to ensure the file fits within 1 byte (8 bits). The original array has 3 distinct values (1, 2, 3), and to fit within 8 bits, we can have up to 256 different values. Therefore, the compression should not change any elements, as the number of distinct values is already within the limit.

However, the program incorrectly calculates `md` and proceeds to find a subarray with the minimum number of distinct values. This approach will not necessarily yield the correct result, as it may miss the optimal solution of keeping all elements unchanged.

The program should directly check if the number of distinct values in the array is already within the limit determined by `8 * I / n`. If it is, no changes are needed. Otherwise, the program should attempt to find the optimal `l` and `r` to minimize the number of changes.

Since the program does not correctly handle this scenario, it is considered incorrect.
