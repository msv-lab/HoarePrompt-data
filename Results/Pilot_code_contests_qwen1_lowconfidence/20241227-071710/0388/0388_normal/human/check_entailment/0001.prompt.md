You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One common way of digitalizing sound is to record sound intensity at particular time moments. For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of n non-negative integers.

If there are exactly K distinct values in the array, then we need k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ bits to store each value. It then takes nk bits to store the whole file.

To reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers l ≤ r, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range [l;r], we don't change it. If it is less than l, we change it to l; if it is greater than r, we change it to r. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.

Your task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size I bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.

We remind you that 1 byte contains 8 bits.

k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ is the smallest integer such that K ≤ 2^{k}. In particular, if K = 1, then k = 0.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and I (1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^{5}, 1 ≤ I ≤ 10^{8}) — the length of the array and the size of the disk in bytes, respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the array denoting the sound file.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal possible number of changed elements.

Examples

Input


6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3

Input


6 2
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


0


Input


6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3


Output


2

Note

In the first example we can choose l=2, r=3. The array becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3, the number of distinct elements is K=2, and the sound file fits onto the disk. Only two values are changed.

In the second example the disk is larger, so the initial file fits it and no changes are required.

In the third example we have to change both 1s or both 3s.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from collections import Counter
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, i) = map(int, input().split())
    ca = sorted(Counter(map(int, input().split())).items(), key=lambda x: x[0])
    md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))
    pref = [0]
    for (_, j) in ca:
        pref.append(pref[-1] + j)
    s = n
    for i in range(len(pref) - md):
        u = pref[i + md] - pref[i]
        s = min(s, n - u)
    if len(pref) - md <= 0:
        s = 0
    func_2(s)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
