Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the compression algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the minimal possible number of changed elements to fit the sound file into the given disk size.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Calculation of `md`:**
   ```python
   md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))
   ```
   This line calculates the maximum number of distinct values that can be stored in the given disk size. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that each value needs `k` bits, where `k` is the ceiling of `log2(K)`. Instead, it assumes each value requires 8 bits, which is not always true.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimal Changes:**
   The logic used to find the minimal number of changes is flawed. It sorts the unique values and their counts, then tries to find a segment of the array with a length equal to `md` to minimize changes. This approach does not guarantee the minimal number of changes needed to fit the file into the disk size.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   Let's consider an example to demonstrate the failure:
   - Input:
     ```
     6 1
     2 1 2 3 4 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2
     ```
   - Actual Output (using the provided code):
     The code does not produce the correct output. It might not correctly handle the case where the number of distinct values needs to be reduced to fit the disk size.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly calculate `k` and then find the minimal number of changes to fit the file into the disk size while ensuring the number of distinct values does not exceed \(2^k\).

Since the provided code does not meet the requirements and fails to produce the correct output for some cases, the correctness is **False**.
