Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the number of distinct values (`K`) is less than or equal to the number of bits required to fit into the disk (`md`). According to the problem description, the goal is to minimize the number of changed elements while ensuring the sound file fits into the given disk size.

In the provided code, the variable `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`, which represents the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into `i` bytes. However, the code does not consider the scenario where `K` (the number of distinct values in the array) is less than or equal to `md`. This means that the compression might not be necessary if the original number of distinct values already fits within the given constraints.

Here is a counterexample that demonstrates the issue:

Input:
```
6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation: The number of distinct values `K` is 4. Since `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * 1 / 6)) = 1`, the code incorrectly assumes that all values need to be compressed, resulting in `s = n` which is `6`.

However, since `K` (4) is greater than `md` (1), the correct output should be `2` because only 2 values need to be changed to fit within the constraints.

Therefore, the code does not handle this edge case correctly, leading to incorrect behavior for certain inputs. Hence, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
