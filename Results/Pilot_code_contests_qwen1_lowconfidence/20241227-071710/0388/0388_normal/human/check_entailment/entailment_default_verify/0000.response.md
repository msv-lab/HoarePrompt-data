Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of changed elements while ensuring the sound file fits within the given disk size. The function `func_1` attempts to find a subarray with the minimum number of distinct values, which is not the correct approach. 

Based on the problem description, the program should:
1. Determine the maximum number of distinct values allowed based on the disk size (`I` bytes).
2. Check if the number of distinct values in the array is already within this limit.
3. If not, find the optimal `l` and `r` to minimize the number of changes.

The current implementation in `func_1` uses an incorrect approach by calculating `md` as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))` and then finding a subarray with the minimum number of distinct values. This approach does not guarantee that the solution will be correct or minimal.

The output hints for `func_2` confirm that it simply prints the elements without any additional processing, which further supports the idea that the primary issue lies in `func_1`.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
