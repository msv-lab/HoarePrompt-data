The function `func_2()` takes no explicit parameters and prints the elements of `args` to `sys.stdout` separated by a space `' '`. It supports optional keyword arguments `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` to customize the output. Specifically:
- `sep` specifies the separator between printed items; defaults to a space `' '`.
- `file` specifies the file object to which the output is written; defaults to `sys.stdout`.
- `end` specifies the string appended after the last value in `args`; defaults to a newline character `'\n'`.
- `flush` determines whether the output is flushed; if set to `True`, the output buffer is forcibly flushed.

After executing the function, the following will be true:
- All elements in `args` are printed to `sys.stdout`, separated by a space.
- If `sep` is provided, the elements are separated by the given string.
- If `end` is provided, it is appended to the output after the last element.
- If `flush` is set to `True`, the output buffer is flushed, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
