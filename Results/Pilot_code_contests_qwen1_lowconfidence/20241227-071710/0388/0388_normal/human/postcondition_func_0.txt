The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `i`, and `ca`. Here's what it does step-by-step:

1. It reads two integers `n` and `i` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^5` and `1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8`.
2. It reads a list of integers from the input, calculates the frequency of each unique integer, and sorts the list of tuples containing unique integers and their frequencies.
3. It calculates `md`, which is the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into `i` bytes, using the formula `int(2
