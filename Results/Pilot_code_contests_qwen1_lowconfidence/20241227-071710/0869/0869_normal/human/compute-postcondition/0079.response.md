The code appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. The variables `v`, `Q`, `nbr[v]`, and `marked` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `res` having the value of `i` appended to it.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with its last element removed, `nbr[v]` contains at least one element, `i` is now in `marked`, `res` contains `i`.**
