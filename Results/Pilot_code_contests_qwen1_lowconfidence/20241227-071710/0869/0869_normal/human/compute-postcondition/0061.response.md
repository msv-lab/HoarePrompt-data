`Q` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `nbr[v]` remains unchanged, `cand` remains an empty set, `marked` remains a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` remains a list containing `[v, i]`, and `Q` now contains `i` in addition to its previous elements (which were none since it was initially empty). 

Output State: **`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, i]`, and `Q` is a list containing `i`.**
