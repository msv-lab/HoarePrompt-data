To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the requirements for the loop to continue:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of substrings from an input string.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - For each iteration, `l[0]` and `l[1]` are substrings from the input string.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary where keys are substrings and values are lists of substrings.
   - `cand` is a list of candidate substrings.
   - The conditions inside the loop update `cand` and `nbr` based on the presence or absence of `l[0]` and `l[1]` in `nbr`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze what happens at the end of one iteration:

- `i` increases by 1 after each iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop (which is not mentioned).

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of substrings from the input string.
- Depending on the specific updates made during the loop, `cand` and `nbr` have been modified accordingly.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following needs to hold true:
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will now be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the new condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `n` is unchanged and `i` was incremented, `i` will now be `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is `i + 1`, and the updated states of `cand` and `nbr` will depend on the previous iteration's logic but will remain consistent with the given conditions.**

In summary:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cand` and `nbr` will remain as per the previous iteration's updates.**
