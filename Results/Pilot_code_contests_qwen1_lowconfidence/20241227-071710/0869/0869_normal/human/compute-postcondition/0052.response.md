The code `marked.add(v)` adds the value `v` to the set `marked`. Since `marked` was initially an empty set, adding `v` to it changes its state. The other variables (`nbr` and `cand`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nbr` is a dictionary representing all unique pairs (a, b) where a and b are connected nodes, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
