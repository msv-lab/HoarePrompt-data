`res` is a list containing `v`, and the code appends `i` to this list. Therefore, the value of `res` changes from `[v]` to `[v, i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nbr[v]` must not be an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, i]`, and `Q` is an empty list.**
