Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the indexes of the cities between which a letter is sent. It constructs a graph using these tuples and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from an arbitrary node to find all reachable nodes. If the graph is connected, it returns the sequence of visited nodes in the order they were visited. If the graph is not connected or the input is invalid, it prints an error message. Potential edge cases include disconnected graphs or invalid input.**

- The function reads `n` (the number of tuples) and initializes an empty dictionary `nbr` to represent the graph and a set `cand` to keep track of candidate nodes.
- It iterates over each tuple, adding directed edges to the graph and updating the `cand` set accordingly.
- After the loop, if `cand` is not empty, it means the graph is disconnected, and the function prints an error message and returns.
- If `cand` is empty, it chooses an arbitrary node `v` and marks it as visited.
- It then performs a DFS starting from `v`, marking all reachable nodes and storing the order of visits in the list `res`.
- Finally, it prints the sequence of visited nodes.

This summary covers all the potential cases and the actions performed by the function, including handling edge cases such as disconnected graphs.
