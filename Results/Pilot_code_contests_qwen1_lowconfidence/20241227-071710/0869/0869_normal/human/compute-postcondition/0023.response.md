The code `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` appends the value of `l[1]` to the list `nbr[l[0]]`. Here, `l[0]` is the key used to access the list in `nbr`, and `l[1]` is the element to be appended to that list. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `l` is a list of substrings from the input string
- `cand` follows the rules based on the contents of `l`

After executing the code, `nbr[l[0]]` will have its value updated to include `l[1]` as an additional element. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` follows the rules based on the contents of `l`, `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`**
