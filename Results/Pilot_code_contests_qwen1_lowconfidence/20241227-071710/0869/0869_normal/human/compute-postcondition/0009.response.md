The code `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` appends the second element of the list `l` to the sublist in `nbr` that corresponds to the first element of `l`. Given the initial state, the first element of `l` is a substring (let's denote it as `sub1`) which is also an element in `nbr` (let's denote it as `sub1_list`). The second element of `l` (denoted as `sub2`) is appended to `sub1_list`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, and the first element of `l` (`sub1`) is in `nbr`; `sub1_list` (the sublist in `nbr` corresponding to `sub1`) now includes `sub2` in addition to its previous elements.**
