The code assigns `l[1]` to `nbr[l[0]]`. This means that `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is `l[0]` and the value is a list containing `l[1]`.

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, and its values remain unchanged.
- `cand` follows the rules based on the contents of `l`, but since no operation involving `cand` is performed, `cand` remains unchanged.

The updated state is:
- `nbr[l[0]]` is now `[l[1]]`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of substrings from the input string.
- `cand` follows the rules based on the contents of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of substrings from the input string; `cand` follows the rules based on the contents of `l`; `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`.**
