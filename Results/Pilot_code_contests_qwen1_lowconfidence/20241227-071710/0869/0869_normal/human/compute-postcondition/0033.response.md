`nbr[l[0]]` is assigned the value `[l[1]]`. The value of `l[0]` is a substring from the input string, and `l[1]` is another substring from the same input string. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the values of `n`, `l`, `cand`, and `nbr` remain as they were in the previous iteration.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cand` and `nbr` will remain as per the previous iteration's updates; `nbr[l[0]]` is now `[l[1]]`.**
