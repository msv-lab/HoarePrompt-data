The code `l = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of substrings. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of `n`, `l`, and `cand`. We know that `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, and `cand` follows certain rules based on the contents of `l`.

Since the code simply reads input and splits it, the values of `n`, `l`, and `cand` are not directly affected by this line of code. The variable `l` will take the split result from the input, but without knowing the actual input, we cannot determine the exact elements of `l`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not used in the given code snippet. The value of `cand` is also not directly altered by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` follows the rules based on the contents of `l`**
