The code `marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Given that `i` is the next element from `nbr[v]` that is not in `marked`, adding `i` to `marked` means that `i` is now included in the set `marked`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, i]`, and `Q` is a list containing `i`.**
