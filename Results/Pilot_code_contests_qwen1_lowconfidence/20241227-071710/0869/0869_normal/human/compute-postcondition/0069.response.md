The code `marked.add(i)` adds the variable `i` to the set `marked`. Given the initial state, `marked` is a set containing `v` and the new `i`. After executing the line of code, `marked` will now contain both `v` and `i`.

The other variables remain unchanged in their initial state.

Output State: **`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, new_i, new_i]`, and `Q` is a list containing `[new_i, new_i]`**
