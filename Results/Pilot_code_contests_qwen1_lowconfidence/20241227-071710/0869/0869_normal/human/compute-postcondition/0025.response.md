Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` is updated based on whether `l[0]` is in `nbr`. If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` has `l[0]` removed, and `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`.**
