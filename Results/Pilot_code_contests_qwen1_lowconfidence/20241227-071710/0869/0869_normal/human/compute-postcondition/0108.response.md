The code `res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` contains all elements except the last one and possibly includes `i` if `i` is not already marked, `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, the next `i` in `nbr[v]` is not in `marked`, `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations plus the current value of `i`; `marked` includes the value of `i`.**
