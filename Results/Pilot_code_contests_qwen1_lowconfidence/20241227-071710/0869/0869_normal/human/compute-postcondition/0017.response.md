The code removes `l[1]` from the `cand` list. Since `cand` did not contain `l[0]` before, this operation does not affect `l[0]`. The `nbr[l[0]]` and `nbr[l[1]]` lists remain unchanged as the code only modifies `cand`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of substrings from the input string; `nbr[l[0]]` is not set to `[l[1]]`; `cand` does not contain `l[0]` and `l[1]` is removed from `cand`; and `nbr[l[1]]` now includes `l[0]`.**
