`Q` is appended with the value `i`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation, so their states remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` contains all elements except the last one and now includes `i`, `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, `i` is in `marked` for all `i` added to `Q`, and `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations plus the new element `i`.
