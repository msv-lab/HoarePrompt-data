`cand.add(l[0])` adds the first element of the list `l` to the set `cand`. The value of `l[0]` is not specified in the initial state, but it is known that it is not in the list `nbr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, the first element of `l` is not in `nbr`; `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, `cand` contains `l[0]`**
