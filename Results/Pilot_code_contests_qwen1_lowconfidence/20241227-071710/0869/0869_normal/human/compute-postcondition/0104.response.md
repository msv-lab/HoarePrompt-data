`Q` is appended with the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The state of `i` is added to `marked`. 

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` contains all elements except the last one and `i` (if `i` is not already marked), `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, the next `i` in `nbr[v]` is not in `marked`, `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations and the current value of `i`, `i` is added to `marked`, `Q` now contains `i` in addition to its previous elements.**
