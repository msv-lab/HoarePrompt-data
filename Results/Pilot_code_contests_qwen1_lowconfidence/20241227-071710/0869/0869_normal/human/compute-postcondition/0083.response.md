The code adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. This means that `i` is now marked. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with `i` appended, `nbr[v]` contains at least one unmarked element, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains `i`, `marked` contains `i`**
