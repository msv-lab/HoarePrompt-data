`cand.add(l[0])` adds the first element of the list `l` to the set `cand`. Since `l` is a list of substrings from an input string, the first element `l[0]` is one of those substrings. The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1`, but its previous value was not specified, so we only know that `i` is now one more than its previous value. The variables `nbr`, `cand`, and `l` are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is one more than its previous value, `cand` contains the substring `l[0]`, `nbr[l[0]]` is now `[l[1]]`.**
