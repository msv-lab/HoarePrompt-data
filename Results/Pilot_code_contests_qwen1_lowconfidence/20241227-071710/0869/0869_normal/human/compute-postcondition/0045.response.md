The code `break` does not affect any variables and simply breaks out of the nearest loop or switch case. Since there is no loop or switch case in the given initial state, the only impact is that we break out of the most internal loop or switch case we were inside. However, since no loop or switch case is mentioned, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nbr` is a dictionary representing all unique pairs (a, b) where a and b are connected nodes, `cand` is a non-empty set and we break out of the most internal loop or switch case.**
