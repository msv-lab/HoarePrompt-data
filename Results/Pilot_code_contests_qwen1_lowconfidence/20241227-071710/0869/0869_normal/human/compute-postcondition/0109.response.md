The code `Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. Based on the initial state, `v` is the last element of `Q` after a pop operation, `Q` contains all elements except the last one, and `i` might already be included if it wasn't marked yet. After appending `i` to `Q`, the updated state of `Q` will include `i` as its last element.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` before the append operation, `Q` now contains all elements except the last one and the newly appended `i`, `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, the next `i` in `nbr[v]` is not in `marked`, `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations plus the current value of `i`; `marked` includes the value of `i`.**
