The code `cand.add(l[1])` adds the element `l[1]` to the set `cand`. Based on the initial state, we know that `cand` is updated based on whether `l[0]` is in `nbr`. If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` has `l[0]` removed, and `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`; `nbr[l[1]]` now includes `[l[0]]`.

Since the code only modifies `cand` by adding `l[1]` to it, and does not affect `n` or `nbr`, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of substrings from the input string; `cand` is updated such that it contains `l[1]` in addition to its previous elements; `nbr` remains unchanged**.
