The code initializes an empty set named `cand`. This does not affect the values of `n`, the list of tuples, or `nbr`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered as input, the list of tuples remains unchanged, `nbr` is an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set**
