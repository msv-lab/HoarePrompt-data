The code initializes a list `Q` with the value `v`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nbr` is a dictionary representing all unique pairs (a, b) where a and b are connected nodes, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v`, `res` is a list containing `v`, and `Q` is a list containing `v`.**
