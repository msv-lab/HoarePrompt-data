`res` appends the value of `i` to itself. Since `res` originally contained `i`, after appending `i` again, `res` now contains `i` twice. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with `i` appended, `nbr[v]` contains at least one unmarked element, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains `i` twice, `marked` contains `i`**
