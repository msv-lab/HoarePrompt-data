`cand.add(l[1])` adds the element `l[1]` to the set `cand`. The previous value of `cand` was either `{l[0], [l[1]]}` (if `cand` initially contained the substring `l[0]` with `nbr[l[0]]` being `[l[1]]`) or `{[l[0]], [l[1]]}` (if `cand` initially had `l[0]` removed with `nbr[l[0]]` containing the updated list with `l[1]` appended). In both cases, after adding `l[1]`, `cand` will now contain `l[1]`.

- The value of `i` is one more than its previous value, which means it is now `i + 1`.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `l` remains a list of substrings from the input string.
- The value of `nbr[l[0]]` is updated if `cand` initially had `l[0]` removed, appending `l[1]` to `nbr[l[0]]`.
- The value of `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is one more than its previous value, `cand` now contains `l[1]`, `nbr[l[0]]` is updated if `cand` initially had `l[0]` removed, appending `l[1]` to `nbr[l[0]]`, and `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`.**
