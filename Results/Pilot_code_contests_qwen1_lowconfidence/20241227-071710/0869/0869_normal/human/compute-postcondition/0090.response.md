`Q` is modified by appending `i` to it, which changes its state. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the updated state is: `v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with `i` appended, `nbr[v]` contains at least one unmarked element other than `i`, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains `i` three times.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with `i` appended, `nbr[v]` contains at least one unmarked element other than `i`, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains `i` three times.**
