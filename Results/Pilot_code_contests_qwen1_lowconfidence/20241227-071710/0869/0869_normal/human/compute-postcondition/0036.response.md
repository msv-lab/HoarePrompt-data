`cand.remove(l[0])` removes the element `l[0]` from the list `cand`. The initial state tells us that `l[0]` is one of the substrings from the input string, and `cand` and `nbr` have been updated in the previous iteration. However, the specific values of `cand` and `nbr` are not provided, so we cannot specify what `cand` becomes after removing `l[0]`.

The other variables (`n`, `l`, `i`, `nbr`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cand` has `l[0]` removed, `nbr[l[0]]` contains the updated list with `l[1]` appended.**
