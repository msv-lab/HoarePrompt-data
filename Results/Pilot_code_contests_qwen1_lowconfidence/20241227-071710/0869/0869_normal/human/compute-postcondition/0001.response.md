The given code initializes an empty dictionary `nbr`. This does not affect the value of `n` or the list of tuples mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the empty dictionary `nbr`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered as input, the list of tuples remains unchanged, `nbr` is an empty dictionary**
