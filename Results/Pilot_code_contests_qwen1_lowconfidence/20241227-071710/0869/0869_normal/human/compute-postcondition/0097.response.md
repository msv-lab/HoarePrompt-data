The code `marked.add(i)` adds the variable `i` to the set `marked`. Since `i` was not previously in `marked`, it now is. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` contains all elements except the last one, `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, `i` is in `marked` for all `i` added to `Q`, and `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations, and `i` is added to `marked`.**
