Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is one more than its previous value. `cand` either contains `l[1]` or `cand` has `l[1]` removed and contains either `l[0]` with `nbr[l[0]]` being `[l[0]]` or `cand` is empty with `nbr[l[0]]` containing the updated list with `l[1]` and `l[0]` appended. Additionally, `nbr[l[0]]` is updated if `cand` initially had `l[0]` removed, appending `l[1]` to `nbr[l[0]]`, and `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`.***
