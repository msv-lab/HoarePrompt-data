The code appends the value `i` to the list `Q`. The previous state shows that `Q` contains `i`, so after appending `i`, `Q` will contain `i` twice. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, i, i]`, and `Q` is a list containing `[i, i]`.**
