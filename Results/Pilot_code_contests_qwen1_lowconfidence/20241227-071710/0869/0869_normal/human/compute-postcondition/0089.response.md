`res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. The initial state tells us that `res` already contains `i` (possibly twice), and now `i` is added again. Therefore, the updated state of `res` is that it contains `i` three times.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with `i` appended, `nbr[v]` contains at least one unmarked element other than `i`, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains `i` three times.**
