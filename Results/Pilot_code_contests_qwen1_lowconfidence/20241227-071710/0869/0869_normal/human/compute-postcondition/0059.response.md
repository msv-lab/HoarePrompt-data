The code adds the variable `i` to the set `marked`. Initially, `marked` contains the value `v`. After adding `i` to `marked`, the set `marked` will contain both `v` and `i`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nbr[v]` must not be an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing `v`, and `Q` is an empty list.**
