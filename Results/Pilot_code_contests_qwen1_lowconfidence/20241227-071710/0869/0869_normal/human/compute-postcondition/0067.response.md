Postcondition: ***`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, i, i]`, and `Q` is a list containing `[i, i]`. This occurs when `i` is not in `marked`. There is no alternative outcome since there is no else part in the code.***
