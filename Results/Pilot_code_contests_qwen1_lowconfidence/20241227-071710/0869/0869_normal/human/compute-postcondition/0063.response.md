According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the contents of `nbr[v]`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `nbr[v]` that are not already in `marked`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary.
- `cand` is an empty set.
- `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`.
- `res` is a list containing `[v, i]`.
- `Q` is a list containing `i`, where `i` is an element from `nbr[v]` that is not already in `marked`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states such that:
- `i` is the next element from `nbr[v]` that is not already in `marked`.
- `nbr[v]` must still contain at least one element that is not in `marked`.

Since `i` was chosen from `nbr[v]` and is not in `marked` at the end of the previous iteration, the next `i` must be the next element from `nbr[v]` that is not in `marked`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `nbr[v]` remains a non-empty dictionary (since it must still contain at least one element).
- `cand` remains an empty set (as it was not modified in the loop).
- `marked` now includes the new `i` (the next element from `nbr[v]` that is not in `marked`).
- `res` updates to include the new pair `[v, i]` (where `i` is the next element from `nbr[v]` that is not in `marked`).
- `Q` updates to include the new `i`.

State: **`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and the new `i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, i]` where `i` is the next element from `nbr[v]` that is not in `marked`, and `Q` is a list containing `i`.**
