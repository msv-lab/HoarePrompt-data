According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `nbr` is an empty dictionary and `cand` is an empty set, these states do not affect the ability of the loop to execute.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

1. `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
2. The other states (`nbr` being an empty dictionary and `cand` being an empty set) do not impact the loop execution directly.

Therefore, the required state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
