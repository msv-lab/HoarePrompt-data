Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string. If `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` is updated such that it contains `l[1]` in addition to its previous elements; `nbr` remains unchanged. If `l[1]` is in `nbr`, `cand` does not contain `l[1]`, and `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` in addition to any existing elements. If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` does not contain `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`.***
