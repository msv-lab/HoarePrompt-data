`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`. This means `n` is set to the integer value entered as input through the raw_input function. The length of the list of tuples remains unknown until further input is provided, but the number of tuples will be equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered as input, the list of tuples remains unchanged**
