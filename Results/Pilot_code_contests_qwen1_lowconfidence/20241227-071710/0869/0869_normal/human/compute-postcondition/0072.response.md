Postcondition: ***`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `new_i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, new_i, new_i]`, and `Q` is a list containing `[new_i, new_i]`. If `i` is not in `marked`, then `marked` is updated to contain `v` and `i`, `res` is updated to include `i`, and `Q` is updated accordingly. If `i` is already in `marked`, no changes occur to `marked`, `res`, and `Q`.***
