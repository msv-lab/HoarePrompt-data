The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers representing the indexes of the cities between which a letter is sent. The length of this list is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and each city index is an integer from 1 to 10^9. All city indexes are unique within each tuple, and the given stamps correspond to some valid route from one city to another.

Case_1: The function returns a sequence indicating the order of visits to the cities based on the given routes. If the routes form a valid path without cycles, it returns a list of city indexes representing the order of visit. If the routes do not form a valid path or contain cycles, it returns an error message indicating the invalidity of the route.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter which is a list of tuples, each containing two integers representing the indexes of the cities between which a letter is sent. It returns a sequence indicating the order of visits to the cities based on the given routes or an error message if the routes are invalid.**
