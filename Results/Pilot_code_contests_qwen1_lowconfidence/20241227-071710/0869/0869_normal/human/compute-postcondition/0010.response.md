`l[0]` is removed from the list `cand`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, and the first element of `l` (`sub1`) is in `nbr`; `sub1_list` (the sublist in `nbr` corresponding to `sub1`) now includes `sub2` in addition to its previous elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` has had its first element removed, and the first element of `l` (`sub1`) is in `nbr`; `sub1_list` (the sublist in `nbr` corresponding to `sub1`) now includes `sub2` in addition to its previous elements.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` has had its first element removed, and the first element of `l` (`sub1`) is in `nbr`; `sub1_list` (the sublist in `nbr` corresponding to `sub1`) now includes `sub2` in addition to its previous elements.**
