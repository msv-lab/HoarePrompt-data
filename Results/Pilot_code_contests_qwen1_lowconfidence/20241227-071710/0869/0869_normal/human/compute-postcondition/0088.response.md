`marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Since `i` is already in `marked`, adding it again does not change the set `marked`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with `i` appended, `nbr[v]` contains at least one unmarked element other than `i`, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains `i` (possibly twice), and if `i` is not in `marked`, `res` contains `i` twice.**
