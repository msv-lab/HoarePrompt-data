Postcondition: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` contains all elements except the last one, `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, `i` is in `marked` for all `i` added to `Q`, and `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations. Additionally, `i` is not in `marked`.**
