`cand` removes the element `l[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` is updated by removing `l[0]`, `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` is updated by removing `l[0]`, `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`**
