Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with all its elements that were not previously in `marked` and are adjacent to `v` appended, `nbr[v]` is empty, `i` is in `marked` for all `i` added to `Q`, and `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations.** 

Explanation:
- The loop continues to append elements from `nbr[v]` to `Q` that are not in `marked`, and marks them as such.
- Once all elements in `nbr[v]` that are not in `marked` have been processed, the loop will stop because there are no more unmarked elements in `nbr[v]`.
- As a result, `Q` will contain all elements adjacent to `v` that were not previously in `marked`.
- `res` will contain all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations.
- `v` remains the last element of `Q` after each pop operation, ensuring that the process starts fresh with the new last element of `Q`.

If the loop does not execute at all, then:
- `v` is the last element of `Q` after pop.
- `Q` is `Q` without any additional elements appended since no elements were added.
- `nbr[v]` is not empty but none of its elements are added to `Q` because they are all marked.
- `res` remains unchanged and does not contain any new elements.
- `marked` may or may not be updated depending on the initial state of the program.
