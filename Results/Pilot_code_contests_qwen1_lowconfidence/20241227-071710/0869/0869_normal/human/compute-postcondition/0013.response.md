The code `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]` assigns the value `[l[0]]` to `nbr[l[1]]`. Based on the initial state, we know that `nbr[l[0]]` is set to `[l[1]]` and `cand` contains `l[0]`. `l[1]` is not already a key in `nbr`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `nbr[l[1]]` is assigned the value `[l[0]]`.
2. The values of `n`, `l`, `nbr`, and `cand` are updated according to this assignment.

After the code is executed, the output state is:

Output State: **`nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, `l[1]` is not in `nbr`**
