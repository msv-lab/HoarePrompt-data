`nbr[l[1]]` is updated to include `l[0]` in its list. Since `l[0]` was not already in `nbr[l[1]]`, it will now be appended to it. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of substrings from the input string; `nbr[l[0]]` is not set to `[l[1]]`; and `cand` does not contain `l[0]`; `nbr[l[1]]` now includes `l[0]`.
