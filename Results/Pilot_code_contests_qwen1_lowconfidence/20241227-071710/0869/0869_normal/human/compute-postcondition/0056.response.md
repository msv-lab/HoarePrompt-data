`v` is assigned the value of `Q.pop()`, which removes and returns the last element of `Q`. Since `Q` initially contains only `v`, `v` will be set to `v` and `Q` will be left as an empty list. The states of the other variables (`nbr`, `cand`, `marked`, and `res`) are not affected.

Output State: **`nbr` is a dictionary representing all unique pairs (a, b) where a and b are connected nodes, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v`, `res` is a list containing `v`, and `Q` is an empty list.**
