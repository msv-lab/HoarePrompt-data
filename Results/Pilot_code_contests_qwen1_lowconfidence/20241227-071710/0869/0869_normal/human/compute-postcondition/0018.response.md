Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` is modified according to the following rules: if `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` is set to `[l[1]]`, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]`, and `cand` contains `l[0]` and `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is already in `nbr`, then `cand` has its first element removed, and `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`. In both cases, `cand` may or may not contain `l[1]` depending on the initial state and the execution path taken.***
