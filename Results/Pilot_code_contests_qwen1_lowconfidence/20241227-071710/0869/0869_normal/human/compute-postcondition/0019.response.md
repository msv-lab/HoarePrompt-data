Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of substrings from the input string.
- `cand` is modified according to specific rules involving `nbr`.

### Loop Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will iterate `n` times. Since `n` is greater than 0, it implies that there are at least one iteration remaining.

### Adjusting States
To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider how the loop variable `i` and the conditions on `n` change with each iteration.

1. **Loop Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented from its previous value.
   - If the loop has just completed its first iteration, `i` would be 1 (assuming `i` starts at 0).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2.

2. **Condition on `n`:**
   - The condition `n > 0` ensures that the loop can continue executing.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 after the increment.

Given these considerations, let's summarize the required state adjustments:

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
- The condition `n > 0` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` is modified according to the following rules: if `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` is set to `[l[1]]`, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]`, and `cand` contains `l[0]` and `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is already in `nbr`, then `cand` has its first element removed, and `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`. In both cases, `cand` may or may not contain `l[1]` depending on the initial state and the execution path taken.**
