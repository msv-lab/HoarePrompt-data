The code `res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `res` is a list containing `[v, i]`. After appending `i` to `res`, the list `res` will now contain `[v, i, i]`.

- The values of the other variables (`nbr[v]`, `cand`, `marked`, and `Q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, i, i]`, and `Q` is a list containing `i`.**
