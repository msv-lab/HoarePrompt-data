`cand.add(l[0])` adds the first element of the list `l` to the set `cand`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, the list `l` remains unchanged, and the condition `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of substrings from the input string; `cand` contains the element `l[0]`; `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`.**
