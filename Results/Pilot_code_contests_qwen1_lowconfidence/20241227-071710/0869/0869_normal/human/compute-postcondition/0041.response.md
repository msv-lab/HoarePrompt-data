The code removes `l[1]` from `cand`. The initial state is that `cand` either contains `l[0]` with `nbr[l[0]]` being `[l[1], l[0]]` or `cand` has `l[0]` removed with `nbr[l[0]]` containing the updated list with `l[1]` and `l[0]` appended. Since `cand.remove(l[1])` is executed, `l[1]` is removed from `cand`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is one more than its previous value, `cand` has `l[1]` removed and `cand` now contains either `l[0]` with `nbr[l[0]]` being `[l[0]]` or `cand` is empty with `nbr[l[0]]` containing the updated list with `l[1]` and `l[0]` appended.**
