The code `cand.remove(l[1])` removes the element `l[1]` from the `cand` list. Based on the initial conditions, if `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` has `l[0]` removed, and `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` in addition to any existing elements.

After executing `cand.remove(l[1])`:
- If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` will no longer contain `l[1]`.
- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` will not contain `l[0]` (since it was already removed) and will not contain `l[1]`.

The output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` does not contain `l[1]`, if `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` does not contain `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` in addition to any existing elements.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` does not contain `l[1]`, if `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` does not contain `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` in addition to any existing elements.**
