The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, since we are currently inside a loop (indicated by "we continue the loop"), the loop will be exited. However, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables outside the scope of the loop. Therefore, the values of `nbr` and `cand` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nbr` is a dictionary representing all unique pairs of connected nodes, `cand` is a non-empty set with at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
