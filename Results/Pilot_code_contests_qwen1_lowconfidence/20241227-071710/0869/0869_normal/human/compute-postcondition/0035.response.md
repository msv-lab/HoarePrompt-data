`nbr[l[0]]` is updated by appending `l[1]` to the list at index `l[0]` in `nbr`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cand` and `nbr` will remain as per the previous iteration's updates; `nbr[l[0]]` contains the updated list with `l[1]` appended.**
