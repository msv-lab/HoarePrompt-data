To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. The loop condition is `len(Q) > 0`.
2. Before the loop, `Q` is a list containing `v`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the length of `Q` must be greater than 0. Since `Q` initially contains `v`, the length of `Q` is 1.

Given this, the current state already satisfies the condition `len(Q) > 0`. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute at least once.

State: **`nbr` is a dictionary representing all unique pairs (a, b) where a and b are connected nodes, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v`, `res` is a list containing `v`, and `Q` is a list containing `v`.**
