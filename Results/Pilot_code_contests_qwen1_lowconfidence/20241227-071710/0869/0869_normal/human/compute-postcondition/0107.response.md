The code `marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. This operation does not affect the values of `v`, `Q`, `nbr[v]`, or `res`. The only variable that is impacted is `marked`, which now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` contains all elements except the last one and possibly includes `i` if `i` is not already marked, `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, the next `i` in `nbr[v]` is not in `marked`, and `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations; `marked` includes the value of `i`.**
