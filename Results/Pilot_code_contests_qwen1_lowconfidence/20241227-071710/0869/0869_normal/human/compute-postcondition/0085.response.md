The code `Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. This changes the state of `Q` by adding `i` to its end. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with `i` appended, `nbr[v]` contains at least one unmarked element, `i` is in `marked`, `res` contains `i` twice, `marked` contains `i`**
