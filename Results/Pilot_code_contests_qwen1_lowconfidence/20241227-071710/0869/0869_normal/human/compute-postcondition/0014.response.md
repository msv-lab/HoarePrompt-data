`cand` is a set that contains `l[0]`. The line `cand.add(l[1])` adds `l[1]` to the set `cand`. Since `l[1]` is not already in `nbr`, it does not change the contents of `nbr`. The value of `cand` will now include both `l[0]` and `l[1]`.

Output State: **`nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`, `cand` contains `l[0], l[1]`**
