To determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes, let's analyze the loop and the transformations it applies to the variables `nbr` and `cand`.

### Analysis of the Loop

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `nbr` as an empty dictionary and `cand` as an empty set.
2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each iteration, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, where `l[0]` and `l[1]` are the elements.
   - The loop updates `nbr` and `cand` based on whether `l[0]` and `l[1]` are already present in `nbr`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### After 1st Iteration
- `l` is a list of substrings from the input.
- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `nbr[l[0]]` is set to `[l[1]]`, and `cand` contains `l[0]`.
- If `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]`, and `cand` contains `l[1]`.
- If `l[0]` or `l[1]` is already in `nbr`, `cand` is updated accordingly.

#### After 2nd Iteration
- Similar logic applies, updating `nbr` and `cand` based on the presence of `l[0]` and `l[1]`.

#### After 3rd Iteration
- The pattern continues, ensuring that each pair `(l[0], l[1])` is added to `nbr` and `cand` is updated appropriately.

### Final State Analysis

After all iterations of the loop, the final state of the variables can be summarized as follows:

- `nbr` will contain all unique pairs `(a, b)` such that `a` and `b` are connected nodes in the graph represented by the input.
- `cand` will be an empty set because every node will be processed and removed from `cand` after being added to `nbr`.

### Conclusion

Since the loop processes all possible pairs `(l[0], l[1])` from the input and updates `nbr` and `cand` accordingly, the final state will be such that `nbr` contains all unique connections between the nodes, and `cand` is empty.

### Output State

Output State: **`nbr` is a dictionary representing all unique pairs `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are connected nodes, `cand` is an empty set.**
