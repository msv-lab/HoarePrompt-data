The code snippet `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]` updates the dictionary `nbr` by setting the key `l[1]` to a list containing the value `l[0]`. Based on the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `l` is a list of substrings from the input string
- `i` is one more than its previous value
- `cand` either contains the substring `l[0]` with `nbr[l[0]]` being `[l[1]]` or `cand` has `l[0]` removed with `nbr[l[0]]` containing the updated list with `l[1]` appended.

After executing the code, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is one more than its previous value, `cand` either contains the substring `l[0]` with `nbr[l[0]]` being `[l[1]]` or `cand` has `l[0]` removed with `nbr[l[0]]` containing the updated list with `l[1]` appended; `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`**
