Output State: **`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing all nodes reachable from `v`, `res` is a list containing all nodes reachable from `v`, and `Q` is a list containing all nodes that were enqueued during the process.** 

Explanation:
- The loop continues to iterate until there are no more unmarked neighbors of `v` in `nbr[v]`.
- Each time the loop runs, it checks if the neighbor `i` is not in `marked`. If it is not, it adds `i` to `marked`, appends `i` to `res`, and enqueues `i` in `Q`.
- Since the loop continues until all neighbors are processed, `marked` will eventually contain all nodes reachable from `v`.
- `res` will also contain all these nodes in the order they were processed.
- `Q` will contain all nodes that were enqueued during the process, which are essentially the nodes added to `res`.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `nbr[v]` is empty from the start), the values of the variables would be:
- `nbr[v]` is an empty dictionary.
- `cand` is an empty set.
- `marked` contains only `v`.
- `res` contains only `v`.
- `Q` is an empty list.

Thus, the final state is as described above.
