The code adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. The initial state specifies that `v` is the last element of `Q` after a pop operation, `Q` has its last element removed, `nbr[v]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `i` is not in `marked`. After executing the code, `i` is added to the set `marked`.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with its last element removed, `nbr[v]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `i` is now in `marked`**
