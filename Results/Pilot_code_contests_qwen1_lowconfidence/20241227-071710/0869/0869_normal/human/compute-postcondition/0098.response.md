`res` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is added to the list `res`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` contains all elements except the last one, `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element, `i` is in `marked` for all `i` added to `Q`, and `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations plus the new element `i`.**
