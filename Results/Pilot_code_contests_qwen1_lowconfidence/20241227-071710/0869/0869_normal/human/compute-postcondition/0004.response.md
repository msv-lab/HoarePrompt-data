`l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variable `n` must still be greater than 0 as the condition is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of substrings from the input string**
