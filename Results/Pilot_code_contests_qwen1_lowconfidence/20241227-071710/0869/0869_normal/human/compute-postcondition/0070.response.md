The code appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` is a list containing `[v, new_i, new_i]`. After appending `i`, the list `res` will have the value `[v, new_i, new_i, i]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nbr[v]` is a non-empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `marked` is a set containing `v` and `i`, `res` is a list containing `[v, new_i, new_i, i]`, and `Q` is a list containing `[new_i, new_i]`**
