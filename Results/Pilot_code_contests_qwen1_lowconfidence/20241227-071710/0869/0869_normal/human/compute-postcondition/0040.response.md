The code snippet `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` appends the value of `l[0]` to the list `nbr[l[1]]`. Given the initial state, `l[0]` is a substring from the input string, and `l[1]` is another substring. The variable `nbr` is a dictionary where the key is a substring and the value is a list of substrings.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of substrings from the input string.
   - `i` is one more than its previous value.
   - `cand` either contains the substring `l[0]` with `nbr[l[0]]` being `[l[1]]` or `cand` has `l[0]` removed with `nbr[l[0]]` containing the updated list with `l[1]` appended.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The line `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` appends `l[0]` to the list `nbr[l[1]]`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `nbr[l[1]]` now includes `l[0]` in addition to any previous elements.
   - The other variables (`n`, `l`, `i`, and `cand`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is one more than its previous value, `cand` either contains the substring `l[0]` with `nbr[l[0]]` being `[l[1], l[0]]` or `cand` has `l[0]` removed with `nbr[l[0]]` containing the updated list with `l[1]` and `l[0]` appended.**
