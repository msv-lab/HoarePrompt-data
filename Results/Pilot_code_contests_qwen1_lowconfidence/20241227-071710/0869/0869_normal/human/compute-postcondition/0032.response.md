The code `l = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter. This affects the `l` variable, which is now updated to this new list. The values of `n`, `i`, `cand`, and `nbr` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cand` and `nbr` will remain as per the previous iteration's updates.**
