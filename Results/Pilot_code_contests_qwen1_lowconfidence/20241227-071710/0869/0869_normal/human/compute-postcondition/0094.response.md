The code `v = Q.pop()` pops the last element from the list `Q` and assigns it to `v`. This means that `v` now holds the last element that was in `Q`, and `Q` will have one less element than before. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` contains all elements except the last one, `nbr[v]` is empty, `i` is in `marked` for all `i` added to `Q`, and `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations.**
