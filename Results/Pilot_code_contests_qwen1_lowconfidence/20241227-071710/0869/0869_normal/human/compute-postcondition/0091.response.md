Postcondition: ***`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is `Q` with `i` appended, `nbr[v]` contains at least one unmarked element other than `i`, `i` is in `marked`, and `res` contains `i` three times.***

Explanation: Given the precondition, if `i` is not in `marked`, the if part ensures that `res` contains `i` three times. Since there is no else part, this condition covers the entire if-else block. Therefore, regardless of whether `i` is in `marked` or not (as per the if condition's check), the overall postcondition remains that `res` contains `i` three times.
