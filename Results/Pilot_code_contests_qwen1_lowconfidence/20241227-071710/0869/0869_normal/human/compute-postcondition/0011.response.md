Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string. If the first element of `l` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` is set to `[l[1]]` and `cand` contains `l[0]`. If the first element of `l` is in `nbr`, then `cand` has had its first element removed, and the first element of `l` (`sub1`) is in `nbr`; the sublist in `nbr` corresponding to `sub1` now includes `sub2` in addition to its previous elements.***
