The code snippet `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` appends the value of `l[0]` to the list `nbr[l[1]]`. Let's break down the steps:

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `l` is a list of substrings from the input string
   - `cand` is updated based on whether `l[0]` is in `nbr`. If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` has `l[0]` removed, and `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`.

2. After executing the code `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])`, the value of `nbr[l[1]]` will include `l[0]` in addition to any existing elements.

3. The values of `n` and `cand` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `nbr[l[1]]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `l` is a list of substrings from the input string
- `cand` is updated based on whether `l[0]` is in `nbr`. If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` has `l[0]` removed, and `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`.
- `nbr[l[1]]` now includes `l[0]` in addition to any existing elements.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of substrings from the input string, `cand` is updated based on whether `l[0]` is in `nbr`. If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` contains `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` has `l[0]` removed, and `nbr[l[0]]` contains all previous elements plus `l[1]`, `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]` in addition to any existing elements**.
