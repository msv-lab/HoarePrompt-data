According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cand`. For the loop to execute, `cand` must contain at least one element. Since `cand` is initially an empty set, we need to adjust the state such that `cand` contains at least one element.

State: **`nbr` is a dictionary representing all unique pairs (a, b) where a and b are connected nodes, `cand` is a non-empty set**
