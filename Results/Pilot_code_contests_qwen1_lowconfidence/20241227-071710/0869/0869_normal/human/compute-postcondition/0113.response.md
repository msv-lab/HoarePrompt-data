The code `print(' '.join(res))` prints the elements of the list `res` separated by a space. This operation does not change the value of any variable, it only outputs the content of `res`. Therefore, the state of `Q`, `nbr[v]`, `marked`, and `v` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the last element of `Q` after pop, `Q` is empty, `nbr[v]` is empty, `marked` contains all vertices that were either directly or indirectly connected to `v`, and `res` contains all unique elements added to `Q` during the loop iterations, and the console prints the elements of `res` separated by a space.**
