#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the indexes of the cities between which a letter is sent. The length of this list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and each city index is an integer from 1 to 10^9. All city indexes are unique within each tuple, and the given stamps correspond to some valid route from one city to another.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the indexes of the cities between which a letter is sent. It constructs a graph using these tuples and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from an arbitrary node to find all reachable nodes. If the graph is connected, it returns the sequence of visited nodes in the order they were visited. If the graph is not connected or the input is invalid, it prints an error message. Potential edge cases include disconnected graphs or invalid input.
