n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each stamp is represented by two integers (city indices) such that 1 ≤ city indices ≤ 10^9. All city indices are unique within a single test case, and the given stamps correspond to a valid route from one city to another without visiting any city more than once.
