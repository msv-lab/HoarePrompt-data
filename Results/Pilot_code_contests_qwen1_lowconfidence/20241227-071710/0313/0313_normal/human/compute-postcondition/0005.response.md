`a` is initially a positive integer, and it undergoes integer division by 3. This means `a` is updated to the quotient of `a` divided by 3, while `b` and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated based on the formula `(3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3`. Since `a` is a positive integer, `a % 3` will be a value between 0 and 2. However, without knowing the exact value of `a`, we can represent the new value of `ans` in terms of the original value of `a`.

Let's denote the updated value of `a` as `a_new`. The expression for `ans` becomes:

\[ ans = (3 - (a \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3 + (3 - (a_{new} \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3 \]

Since `a_new = a // 3`, the new remainder when `a_new` is divided by 3 will be `a_new % 3 = a // 3 % 3`. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is:

\[ ans = (3 - (a \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3 + (3 - ((a \mod 3) \cdot 3 // 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3 \]
\[ ans = (3 - (a \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3 + (3 - (a \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3 \]
\[ ans = 2 \times ((3 - (a \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3) \]

So, the updated values are:

- `a` is updated to `a // 3`
- `ans` is updated to `2 * ((3 - (a \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3)`

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a // 3`, `ans` is `2 * ((3 - (a \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3)`, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\)**
