The code `ans *= 3` multiplies the current value of `ans` by 3. Given that the initial state of `ans` is 0, multiplying 0 by any number (including 3) results in 0. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0**
