The code `a //= 3` means that the value of `a` is updated to be the integer division of `a` by 3. Since the initial state is given as `a` is `a_initial // 3` and `b` is `b_initial // 3`, the value of `a` is already the result of an integer division by 3. Dividing an integer that is already the result of an integer division by 3 again by 3 will result in an integer division.

Let's denote `a_initial // 3` as `a_value`. So, initially, `a = a_value`.

After executing `a //= 3`, `a` will be updated to `a_value // 3`.

The value of `b` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is `a_initial // 9`, `b` is `b_initial // 3`, `ans` is unchanged**
