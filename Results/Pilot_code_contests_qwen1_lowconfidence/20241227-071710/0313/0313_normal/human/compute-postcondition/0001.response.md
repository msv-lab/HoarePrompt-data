The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. However, the initial values of `a` and `b` are not specified, only their ranges. The variable `c` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, `c` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 10^9, `ans` is 0**
