Let's break down the process step by step:

1. Initial State: 
   - `a` is updated to `a // 3`
   - `ans` is `2 * ((3 - (a % 3) + (b % 3)) % 3)`
   - `b` is updated to `b // 3`
   - Both `a` and `b` must be at least 3

2. Code Execution:
   - The line `ans *= 3` multiplies the current value of `ans` by 3.

Since `ans` is initially calculated as `2 * ((3 - (a % 3) + (b % 3)) % 3)`, let's express `ans` in terms of `a` and `b`:
   - Let `a % 3 = r_a` and `b % 3 = r_b`.
   - Then `ans = 2 * ((3 - r_a + r_b) % 3)`.

After multiplying `ans` by 3, the new value of `ans` becomes `3 * ans`.

So, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is updated to `a // 3`, `ans` is `3 * 2 * ((3 - (a % 3) + (b % 3)) % 3)`, `b` is updated to `b // 3`**.
