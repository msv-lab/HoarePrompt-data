`b` is updated to `b // 3`, which means `b` is divided by 3 and the result is an integer. The value of `a` and `ans` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated to `a // 3`, `ans` is `3 * 2 * ((3 - (a % 3) + (b % 3)) % 3) + (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3`, `b` is updated to `b // 3`.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a // 3`, `ans` is `3 * 2 * ((3 - (a % 3) + (b % 3)) % 3) + (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3`, `b` is updated to `b // 3`**
