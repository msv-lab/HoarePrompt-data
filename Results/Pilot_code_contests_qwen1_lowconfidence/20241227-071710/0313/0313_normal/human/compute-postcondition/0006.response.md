The code `b //= 3` divides the value of `b` by 3 and updates `b` with the quotient, performing floor division.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is updated to `a // 3`
- `ans` is `2 * ((3 - (a \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3)`
- `b` is a positive integer
- `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\)

After executing the code:
- The value of `b` is updated to `b // 3`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is updated to `a // 3`, `ans` is `2 * ((3 - (a \mod 3) + (b \mod 3)) \mod 3)`, `b` is updated to `b // 3`, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\)**
