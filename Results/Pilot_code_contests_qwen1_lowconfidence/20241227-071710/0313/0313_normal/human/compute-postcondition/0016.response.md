The code snippet `b //= 3` means that the value of `b` is divided by 3 and the result is assigned back to `b`. Given the initial state where `b` is `b_initial // 3`, dividing `b` by 3 again will result in `b_initial // 9`.

Therefore, the updated value of `b` is `b_initial // 9`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as `a_initial // 9`, and `ans` remains unchanged as well.

Output State: **`a` is `a_initial // 9`, `b` is `b_initial // 9`, `ans` is unchanged**
