The code `a //= 3` updates the value of `a` to `a // 3`. The previous state was that `a` was updated to `a // 3` and `ans` was calculated as `3 * 2 * ((3 - (a % 3) + (b % 3)) % 3) + (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3`, and `b` was updated to `b // 3`.

Since `a` was already updated to `a // 3`, this line simply reassigns the same value back to `a`. The value of `b` was also updated to `b // 3`, so it remains unchanged in this line. The value of `ans` is dependent on the current values of `a` and `b`, but since these values are unchanged, `ans` remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a // 3`, `ans` is `3 * 2 * ((3 - (a % 3) + (b % 3)) % 3) + (3 - a % 3 + b % 3) % 3`, `b` is updated to `b // 3`**
