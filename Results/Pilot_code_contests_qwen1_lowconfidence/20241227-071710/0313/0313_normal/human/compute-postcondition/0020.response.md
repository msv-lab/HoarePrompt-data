Functionality: **The function reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from standard input, where \(0 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). It then iteratively transforms these integers using specific arithmetic operations until both `a` and `b` become zero. During each iteration, `ans` is updated based on the modulo and sum operations of `a` and `b`. After the loop completes, the function prints the final value of `ans`. The function does not return a value explicitly, but the final state of `ans` is the output. Edge cases include when either `a` or `b` is initially zero; in such cases, the loop may not execute at all, and `ans` remains zero.**

The function performs the following actions:
1. Reads two integers `a` and `b` from standard input.
2. Iterates as long as both `a` and `b` are greater than zero.
3. Updates `ans` by multiplying it by 3 and adding a transformed value derived from the modulo and sum operations of `a` and `b`.
4. Divides both `a` and `b` by 3 using integer division.
5. Prints the final value of `ans`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` and `b` are both zero, and the value of `ans` reflects the result of the iterative transformations performed on the initial values of `a` and `b`.
