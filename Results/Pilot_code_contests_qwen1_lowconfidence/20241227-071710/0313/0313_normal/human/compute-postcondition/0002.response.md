According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the conditions `a > 0` and `b > 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions must be true.

Right before the loop:
- `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq a \leq 10^9\)
- `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq b \leq 10^9\)
- `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\)
- `ans` is 0

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, both `a` and `b` need to be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `a` and `b` to ensure they are both positive.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c \leq 10^9\), `ans` is 0**
