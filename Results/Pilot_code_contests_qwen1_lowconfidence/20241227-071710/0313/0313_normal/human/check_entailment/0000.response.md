Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle cases where the most significant digit results in a carry-over condition. Specifically, when `a` and `b` have the same most significant digit and both are 2, the program incorrectly calculates the result without considering the carry-over.

For example, consider the input `a = 22` and `c = 11`:

- Binary representation (for clarity):
  - `a = 22` in base 3 is `220`
  - `c = 11` in base 3 is `102`
  
- According to the problem description, performing `220` tor `b` should result in `102`.
- The program should compute the result digit by digit, considering the carry-over:
  - For the least significant digit: `0 tor d = 2`, so `d = 1`.
  - For the next digit: `2 tor b = 0`, which implies `b = 2` because `2 - 2 = 0`.
  - For the most significant digit: `2 tor b = 1`, but since there is no carry, `b = 1`.

However, the program incorrectly computes the result as `11` instead of `121` (which is the correct result considering the carry-over).

Thus, the program does not correctly handle cases involving carry-over conditions, making it incorrect.
