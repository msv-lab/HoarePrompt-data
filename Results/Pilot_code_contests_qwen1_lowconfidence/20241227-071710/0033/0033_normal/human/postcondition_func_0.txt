The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `s` of length `n` containing strings that are either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. It counts the occurrences of each outcome ('AC', 'WA', 'TLE', 'RE') and calls the function `func_2` four times to print these counts in the format "Outcome x Count". The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include the input `n` being less than 1 or greater than \(10^5\), and the list `s` containing only one of the specified outcomes or an empty list. However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly.
