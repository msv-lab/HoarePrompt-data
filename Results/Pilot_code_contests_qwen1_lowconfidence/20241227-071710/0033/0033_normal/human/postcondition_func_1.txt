The function `func_2` accepts a variable-length argument list `args` containing strings and a dictionary `kwargs` that can optionally contain 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' keys. It prints the contents of `args` to a specified output stream (`file`), using the provided separator (`sep`), end character (`end`), and flushes the output buffer if requested (`flush`). If `file` is not specified, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The function ensures that the output is properly formatted based on the provided arguments. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty, `sep` is not provided, `file` is not provided, `end` is not provided, and `flush` is not provided. If `args` is empty, nothing is printed. If `sep` is not provided, the default separator is a single space. If `file` is not provided, the output is directed to `sys.stdout`. If `end` is not provided, the default end character is a newline. If `flush` is not provided, the output buffer is not flushed.
