Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of test cases for each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`) and prints them in the required format. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `N` and then processes each of the `N` strings.
2. **Verdict Counting**: It correctly increments the counters (`ac`, `wa`, `tle`, `re`) based on the verdict strings.
3. **Output Formatting**: The `func_2` function correctly formats and prints the results in the specified format.

Since the program handles all possible inputs as described and produces the correct output, it is correct. There are no edge cases or examples found where the program fails to meet the requirements.
