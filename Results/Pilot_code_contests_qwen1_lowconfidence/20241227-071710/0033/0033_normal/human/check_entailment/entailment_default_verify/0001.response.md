Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program correctly counts the occurrences of `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE` for each test case and prints the results in the specified format. The `func_2` function handles various scenarios for formatting the output, such as different separators, file redirection, and end characters, as described in the output hints. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the program logic aligns with the problem requirements, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
