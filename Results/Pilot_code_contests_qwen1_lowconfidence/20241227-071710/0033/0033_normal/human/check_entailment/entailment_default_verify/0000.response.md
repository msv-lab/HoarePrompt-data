Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code functionality. The program correctly processes the input, counts the occurrences of each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`), and prints the results in the required format. The `func_2` function, as detailed in the output hints, correctly handles the printing process with various optional parameters, ensuring flexibility in formatting the output. Since the program meets all the requirements and constraints specified in the problem description, the original assessment of its correctness is maintained.
