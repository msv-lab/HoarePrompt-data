You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi is participating in a programming contest called AXC002, and he has just submitted his code to Problem A.

The problem has N test cases.

For each test case i (1\leq i \leq N), you are given a string S_i representing the verdict for that test case. Find the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively.

See the Output section for the output format.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* S_i is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S_1
\vdots
S_N


Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

#Function 1:

    n = int(input())
    s = [input() for _ in range(n)]
    ac = 0
    wa = 0
    tle = 0

    for i in s:
        if i == 'AC':

        elif i == 'WA':
            wa += 1
        elif i == 'TLE':
            tle += 1

    func_2('AC x', ac)
    func_2('WA x', wa)
    func_2('TLE x', tle)
    func_2('RE x', re)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of test cases for each verdict (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, `RE`) and prints them in the required format. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `N` and then processes each of the `N` strings.
2. **Verdict Counting**: It correctly increments the counters (`ac`, `wa`, `tle`, `re`) based on the verdict strings.
3. **Output Formatting**: The `func_2` function correctly formats and prints the results in the specified format.

Since the program handles all possible inputs as described and produces the correct output, it is correct. There are no edge cases or examples found where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a variable-length argument list `args` containing strings and a dictionary `kwargs` that can optionally contain 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' keys. It prints the contents of `args` to a specified output stream (`file`), using the provided separator (`sep`), end character (`end`), and flushes the output buffer if requested (`flush`). If `file` is not specified, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The function ensures that the output is properly formatted based on the provided arguments. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty, `sep` is not provided, `file` is not provided, `end` is not provided, and `flush` is not provided. If `args` is empty, nothing is printed. If `sep` is not provided, the default separator is a single space. If `file` is not provided, the output is directed to `sys.stdout`. If `end` is not provided, the default end character is a newline. If `flush` is not provided, the output buffer is not flushed.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
