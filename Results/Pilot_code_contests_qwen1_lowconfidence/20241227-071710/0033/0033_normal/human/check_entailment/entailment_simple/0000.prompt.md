You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Takahashi is participating in a programming contest called AXC002, and he has just submitted his code to Problem A.

The problem has N test cases.

For each test case i (1\leq i \leq N), you are given a string S_i representing the verdict for that test case. Find the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively.

See the Output section for the output format.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* S_i is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S_1
\vdots
S_N


Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

Examples

Input

AC
TLE

Output

AC x 3
WA x 1
TLE x 2
RE x 0


Input

Output

AC x 10
WA x 0
TLE x 0
RE x 0
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
