Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` from standard input, representing the number of test cases.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing a string representing the verdict for each test case (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`). This part correctly handles the input as described.

2. **Counting Verdicts**:
   - The program initializes counters for `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE` to zero.
   - It iterates through the list of verdicts and increments the appropriate counter based on the type of verdict encountered. This ensures that the counts are accurate.

3. **Output Format**:
   - After processing all the verdicts, the program prints the counts in the required format:
     ```
     AC x C_0
     WA x C_1
     TLE x C_2
     RE x C_3
     ```
   - The counters `C_0`, `C_1`, `C_2`, and `C_3` are used to format the output strings, ensuring that the output matches the specified format.

4. **Function Definitions**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly defined and used as described. `func_1` processes the input and calculates the counts, while `func_2` prints the formatted output.

Since the program accurately reads the input, processes it, and outputs the results in the correct format without any additional or missing steps, it correctly follows the problem description for all possible valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
