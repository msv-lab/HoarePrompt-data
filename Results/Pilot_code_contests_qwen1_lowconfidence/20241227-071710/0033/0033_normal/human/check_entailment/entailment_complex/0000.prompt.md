You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi is participating in a programming contest called AXC002, and he has just submitted his code to Problem A.

The problem has N test cases.

For each test case i (1\leq i \leq N), you are given a string S_i representing the verdict for that test case. Find the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively.

See the Output section for the output format.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* S_i is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S_1
\vdots
S_N


Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

Output

Let C_0, C_1, C_2, and C_3 be the numbers of test cases for which the verdict is `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE`, respectively. Print the following:


AC x C_0
WA x C_1
TLE x C_2
RE x C_3

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `s` of length `n` containing strings that are either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. It counts the occurrences of each outcome ('AC', 'WA', 'TLE', 'RE') and calls the function `func_2` four times to print these counts in the format "Outcome x Count". The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include the input `n` being less than 1 or greater than \(10^5\), and the list `s` containing only one of the specified outcomes or an empty list. However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing strings, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' keys with specific types and purposes as described in the docstring of the function.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a variable-length argument list `args` containing strings and a dictionary `kwargs` that can optionally contain 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' keys. It prints the contents of `args` to a specified output stream (`file`), using the provided separator (`sep`), end character (`end`), and flushes the output buffer if requested (`flush`). If `file` is not specified, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The function ensures that the output is properly formatted based on the provided arguments. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty, `sep` is not provided, `file` is not provided, `end` is not provided, and `flush` is not provided. If `args` is empty, nothing is printed. If `sep` is not provided, the default separator is a single space. If `file` is not provided, the output is directed to `sys.stdout`. If `end` is not provided, the default end character is a newline. If `flush` is not provided, the output buffer is not flushed.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
