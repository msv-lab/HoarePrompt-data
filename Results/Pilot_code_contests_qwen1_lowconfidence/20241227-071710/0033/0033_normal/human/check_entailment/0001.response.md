Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case to count the occurrences of `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, and `RE` verdicts, and prints the counts in the specified format. 

- The program handles all possible inputs as specified in the constraints (`1 \leq N \leq 10^5` and `S_i` can be `AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`).
- It correctly uses nested functions to manage the printing process.
- The logic for counting and printing the verdicts is straightforward and follows the problem description accurately.

Given these observations, there are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements, making the program correct.
