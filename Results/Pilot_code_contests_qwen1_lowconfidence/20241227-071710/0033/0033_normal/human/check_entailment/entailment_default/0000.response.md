Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown:

1. The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `n` lines of input, each containing a verdict string (`AC`, `WA`, `TLE`, or `RE`).
2. It then iterates through the list of verdicts, counting the occurrences of each verdict type.
3. Finally, it calls `func_2` to print the counts in the specified format.

The `func_2` function correctly formats and prints the counts, using the provided arguments to control formatting (separator, end character, etc.). There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or hints that would cause the code to fail, assuming the input is valid.

Given that the code handles all specified cases correctly and there are no potential issues based on the provided information, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
