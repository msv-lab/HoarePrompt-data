Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case when the input `n` is 0. According to the problem description, the input `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`. However, the code initializes counters for each verdict (`ac`, `wa`, `tle`, `re`) and expects a list `s` of length `n`. If `n` is 0, the list `s` will be empty, and the code will not enter the loop to count the verdicts. As a result, the output will be:

```
AC x 0
WA x 0
TLE x 0
RE x 0
```

This output is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual number of each verdict in the empty list. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for the case when `n` is 0.
