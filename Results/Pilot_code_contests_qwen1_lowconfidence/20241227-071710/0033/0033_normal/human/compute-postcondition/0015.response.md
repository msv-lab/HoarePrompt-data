The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The initial state includes that `args` contains at least two strings, `at_start` is `False`, and `file` has already written `sep` and then `str(x)` for each element in `args`. Since writing to a file does not change the state of variables other than the content of the file itself, the variables `args`, `at_start`, and `file` remain unchanged except for the additional content written to the file.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two strings, `at_start` is False, `file` has written `sep` and then `str(x)` for each element in `args`, and the file now also contains `sep`.**
