Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `args` must contain at least one string.
   - `at_start` is `False`.
   - If `not at_start` is `True`, then `file` has written the value of `sep` to the file.
   - `file` has written `str(x)` to the file.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `args`.
   - Each iteration writes `str(x)` to the file.
   - If `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is written to the file before writing `str(x)`, unless this is the first iteration (which it is not because `at_start` is `False`).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `args` still contains at least one string (since the loop continues as long as there are elements to process).
   - `at_start` is still `False` (the state does not change inside the loop body as per given information).
   - `file` has written `str(x)` to the file (the current value of `x` in the previous iteration).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `at_start` is `False`, `sep` will be written to the file before `str(x)` in the next iteration.
   - The next value of `x` from `args` will be processed, and its string representation will be written to the file.

5. **Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `args` still contains at least one string.
   - `at_start` remains `False`.
   - `file` will have written `sep` followed by `str(x)` in the next iteration (where `x` is the next element in `args`).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`args` must contain at least one string, `at_start` is False, `file` has written `sep` to the file and then written `str(x)` to the file, where `x` is the next element in `args`**.
