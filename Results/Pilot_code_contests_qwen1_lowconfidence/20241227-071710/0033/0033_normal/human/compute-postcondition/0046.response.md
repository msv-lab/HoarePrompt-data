Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `s` of length `n` containing strings that are either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. It counts the occurrences of each outcome ('AC', 'WA', 'TLE', 'RE') and calls the function `func_2` four times to print these counts in the format "Outcome x Count". The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include the input `n` being less than 1 or greater than \(10^5\), and the list `s` containing only one of the specified outcomes or an empty list. However, the provided code does not handle these edge cases explicitly.**

The function performs the following actions:
1. Reads an integer `n` and a list `s` of `n` strings.
2. Initializes counters `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` to zero.
3. Iterates through the list `s` and increments the respective counter for each outcome.
4. Calls the function `func_2` four times to print the counts of each outcome in the format "Outcome x Count".

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has processed the input list `s` and printed the counts of 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', and 'RE' outcomes using the function `func_2`.
