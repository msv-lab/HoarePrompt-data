Postcondition: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing strings, `at_start` is `False`, `file` has written the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `\n`, unless `at_start` was `True` initially, in which case no leading `sep` is written. The `flush` parameter has been popped from `kwargs`, and the file buffer is flushed since `flush` is `True`.**
