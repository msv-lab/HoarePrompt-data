`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which was its previous value. The other variables (`args`, `file`, and `sep`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the `args` list must still contain at least one string, and the `file` object still has written `sep` and then `str(x)` for each element in `args`.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one string, `at_start` is False, `file` has written `sep` and then `str(x)` for each element in `args`.**
