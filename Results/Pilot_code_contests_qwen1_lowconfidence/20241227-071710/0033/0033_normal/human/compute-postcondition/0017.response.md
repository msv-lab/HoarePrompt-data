The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since `x` is one of the elements in `args`, the file already contains `sep` followed by the string representation of each element in `args`, with an additional `sep` at the end. Writing `str(x)` to the file will append the string representation of `x` after the last `sep`.

The initial state is:
- `args` must contain at least two strings.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `file` has written `sep` and then `str(x)` for each element in `args`, with an additional `sep` at the end.

After executing `file.write(str(x))`, the file will have the `sep` followed by the string representations of all elements in `args`, with an additional `sep` at the end, and then the string representation of `x` appended.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two strings, `at_start` is False, and `file` has written `sep` and then `str(x)` for each element in `args`, with an additional `sep` at the end, and then the string representation of `x` appended.**
