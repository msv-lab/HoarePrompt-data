`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `args` and `kwargs` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **args is a variable-length argument list containing strings, kwargs is a dictionary with 'sep' and 'file' keys removed, and their values are assigned to `sep` and `file` respectively (if they exist, otherwise default to ' ' and sys.stdout respectively); `at_start` is `True`**
