The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `s`, which is a list of strings where each string `S_i` is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, so we can infer that it might be calculating something related to the list `s`.

Given the parameter constraints and relationships, the functionality of the function `func_1` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `s` of strings, where each string in `s` is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', and calculates and returns the count of 'AC' outcomes.**
