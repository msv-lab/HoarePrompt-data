The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the following:
- It writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file `file`.
- `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` removes the key `'end'` from `kwargs` and returns its value, which is `\n` if `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a variable-length argument list containing strings.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `file` has written the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args` separated by `sep`, unless `at_start` was `True` initially, in which case no leading `sep` is written.

Since `kwargs` is not mentioned in the initial state and there's no indication that `kwargs` was previously defined or altered, we can assume `kwargs` is empty or does not contain the key `'end'`. Therefore, `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` will return `\n`.

So, the code writes `\n` to the file `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing strings, `at_start` is `False`, `file` has written the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `\n`, unless `at_start` was `True` initially, in which case no leading `sep` is written.**
