The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Given the initial state where `file` has already written `sep` and then `str(x)` for each element in `args`, writing `str(x)` again does not change the fact that the file already contains those strings. The variable `args` still contains at least one string, `at_start` remains `False`, and the file has already written the initial values.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one string, `at_start` is False, `file` has written `sep` and then `str(x)` for each element in `args`.**
