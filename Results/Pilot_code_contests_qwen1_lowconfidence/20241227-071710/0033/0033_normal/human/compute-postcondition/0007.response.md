`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know it will be converted to a string before writing. The other variables (`args`, `at_start`, `file`, `sep`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one string, if `not at_start` is True, then `file` has written the value of `sep` to the file, otherwise no change occurs to the file; `file` has written `str(x)` to the file.**
