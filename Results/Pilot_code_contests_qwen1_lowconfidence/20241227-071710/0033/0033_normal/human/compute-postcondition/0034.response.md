`tle` is incremented by 1. The value of `n`, `s`, `i`, `ac`, `wa`, `re`, and the constraints on these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of \(n-1\) strings with at least one more element, `i` is the next index in the list, `ac` is the current count of 'AC', `wa` is the current count of 'WA', `re` is the current count of 'RE', and `tle` is the current count of 'TLE' + 1.**
