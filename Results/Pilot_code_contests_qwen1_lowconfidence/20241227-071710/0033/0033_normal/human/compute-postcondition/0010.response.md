The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. This does not change the value of `sep`, `args`, `at_start`, or `file`. After executing this line, the file content will include the value of `sep` followed by the value of `str(x)`. 

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one string, `at_start` is False, `file` has written `sep` and then `str(x)` to the file**
