The function `func_2` is called with two arguments: `'TLE x'` and `tle`. However, the function definition is not provided, so we can only infer the impact based on the arguments given.

Given the arguments, `func_2` likely updates the `tle` variable by incrementing it by the integer value of `x` in the string `'TLE x'`. The string `'TLE x'` suggests that `x` is an integer following the substring `'TLE '`.

Let's assume the function updates `tle` by adding the integer value of `x` to `tle`. The initial state of `tle` is the count of 'TLE' in the list `s`. After calling `func_2`, `tle` will be updated to `tle + x`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', `ac` is the total count of 'AC' in the list `s` plus 1, and `wa` is the total count of 'WA' in the list `s` plus 1, and `re` is the total count of 'RE' in the list `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', `ac` is the total count of 'AC' in the list `s` plus 1, `wa` is the total count of 'WA' in the list `s` plus 1, `re` is the total count of 'RE' in the list `s`, `tle` is the initial count of 'TLE' plus the integer value of `x` in the string `'TLE x'`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', `ac` is the total count of 'AC' in the list `s` plus 1, `wa` is the total count of 'WA' in the list `s` plus 1, `re` is the total count of 'RE' in the list `s`, `tle` is the initial count of 'TLE' plus the integer value of `x` in the string `'TLE x'`**.
