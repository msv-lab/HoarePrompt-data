The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file associated with `file`. However, the initial state does not specify what `sep` is set to. Since no value is assigned to `sep` in the given code snippet, the only impact is on the file object.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one string, the value of `not at_start` is True, `file` has written the value of `sep` to the file.**
