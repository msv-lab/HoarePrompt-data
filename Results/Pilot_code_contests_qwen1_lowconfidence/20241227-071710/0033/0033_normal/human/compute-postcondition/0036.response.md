Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of \(n-1\) strings with at least one more element, `i` is the next index in the list, `ac` is the current count of 'AC', `wa` is the current count of 'WA', `tle` is the current count of 'TLE'. If `i` is 'RE', `re` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the counts `ac`, `wa`, and `tle` remain unchanged.***
