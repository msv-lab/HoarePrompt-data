`re` is incremented by 1, which means `re` will now be `re + 1`. All other variables (`n`, `s`, `ac`, `wa`, `tle`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of \(n-1\) strings, `ac` is 1 if the current element is 'AC', `wa` is 1 if the current element is 'WA', `tle` is 2 if the current element is 'TLE', `re` is `re + 1` if the current element is 'RE', and `wa`, `tle`, `re` remain unchanged if the current element is anything other than 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'.**
