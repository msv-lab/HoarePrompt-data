Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of \(n-1\) strings with at least one more element, `i` is the next index in the list, `ac` is the current count of 'AC' plus 1 if `i` is 'AC', `wa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'WA', `tle` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'TLE', `re` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'RE', and the counts `ac`, `wa`, `tle`, and `re` remain unchanged if `i` is none of the above.***
