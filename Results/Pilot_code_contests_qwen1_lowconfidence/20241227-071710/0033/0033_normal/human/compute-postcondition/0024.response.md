The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `args`, which is a variable-length argument list containing strings, and `kwargs`, which is a dictionary that can contain 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' keys with specific types and purposes as described in the docstring of the function. 

The function does not explicitly return anything mentioned directly in the provided output, but based on the typical use of `args` and `kwargs` in Python functions, it is likely that the function prints the contents of `args` using the formatting options specified in `kwargs`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a variable-length argument list `args` containing strings and a dictionary `kwargs` that can contain formatting options such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush', and then print the contents of `args` according to the formatting options provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a variable-length argument list `args` containing strings and a dictionary `kwargs` that can contain 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' keys, and then prints the contents of `args` according to the formatting options provided.**
