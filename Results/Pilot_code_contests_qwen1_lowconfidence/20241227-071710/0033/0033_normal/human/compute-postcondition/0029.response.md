Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of \(n-1\) strings, `ac` is 1 if the current element is 'AC', `wa` is 2 if the current element was 'WA' and was previously 1, or remains 1 if the current element was not 'WA', `tle` is incremented by 1 if the current element is 'TLE', `re` is incremented by 1 if the current element is 'RE', and `wa`, `tle`, and `re` remain unchanged if the current element is anything other than 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE'.***
