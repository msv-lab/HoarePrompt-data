Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop**: The given for loop iterates over each element in the `args` list. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one string.

2. **Initial States Provided**:
   - `args` is a variable-length argument list containing strings.
   - `kwargs` is a dictionary with 'sep' and 'file' keys removed, and their values are assigned to `sep` and `file` respectively (if they exist, otherwise default to ' ' and `sys.stdout` respectively).
   - `at_start` is `True`.

3. **Identify Necessary Adjustments**:
   - The presence of strings in `args` is necessary for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `sep` and `file` are derived from `kwargs` but are not directly relevant to the loop execution since the loop iterates over `args`.
   - The value of `at_start` being `True` is also not directly relevant to the loop execution itself.

4. **Formulate the State**:
   - For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one string.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is:
State: **`args` must contain at least one string**.
