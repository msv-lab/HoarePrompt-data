The function `func_2('WA x', wa)` is called. However, since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we can only infer that it likely uses its second argument, `wa`. The first argument, `'WA x'`, does not seem to directly affect the variables in the current context.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\),
- `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE',
- `ac` is the total count of 'AC' in the list `s` plus 1,
- `wa` is the total count of 'WA' in the list `s`,
- `tle` is the total count of 'TLE' in the list `s`,
- `re` is the total count of 'RE' in the list `s`.

The call to `func_2` could potentially modify the value of `wa`. Since no specifics about `func_2` are given, we assume it might increment or decrement `wa` by 1 (based on the string `'WA x'`). Thus, `wa` is updated by adding 1 to its current value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of `n` strings where each string is either 'AC', 'WA', 'TLE', or 'RE', `ac` is the total count of 'AC' in the list `s` plus 1, `wa` is the total count of 'WA' in the list `s` plus 1, `tle` is the total count of 'TLE' in the list `s`, `re` is the total count of 'RE' in the list `s`.**
