`ac` is incremented by 1, which means `ac` now holds the value of its previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s` is a list of \(n-1\) strings with at least one more element, `i` is the next index in the list, `ac` is the current count of 'AC' plus 1, `wa` is the current count of 'WA', `tle` is the current count of 'TLE', and `re` is the current count of 'RE'.
