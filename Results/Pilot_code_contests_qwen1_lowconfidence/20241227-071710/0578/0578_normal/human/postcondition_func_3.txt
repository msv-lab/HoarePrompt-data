The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop has been executed, the function returns `x` as the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` as 0. This is achieved through a while loop that repeatedly updates `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` holds the GCD. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0 initially, as the loop will terminate immediately without performing any iterations. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and the annotations accurately describe the state of the program after its execution.
