You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. s and t are strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters. freq is a dictionary representing the frequency count of characters in string s.

    n, k = map(int, func_5().split())

        else:
            func_3('No')
            return
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `groups` is a non-empty list of substrings consisting of consecutive identical characters from string `t`, `div` is the integer division of the length of each substring in `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of each substring in `groups` divided by `k`, `freq` is the updated frequency count of characters in string `s` after the loop, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is the index of the first character in each group. If the loop executes, the frequency of characters in `freq` will be reduced accordingly based on the conditions in the loop. If the loop does not execute, the function will call `func_3('No')` and return without modifying `freq`.
    func_3('Yes')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on values obtained from calling `func_5()` and uses a `Counter` to count character frequencies in string `s`. It processes string `t` to find substrings of consecutive identical characters, then iterates over these substrings. For each substring, it calculates `div` (integer division of the substring's length by `k`) and `rem` (remainder). It checks if the frequency of the first character in the substring in `freq` is less than `rem`. If so, it calls `func_3('No')` and returns. Otherwise, it updates the frequency count in `freq` and attempts to find a character with sufficient frequency to cover the `div` part of the substring. If no such character is found, it again calls `func_3('No')` and returns. If all checks pass, it calls `func_3('Yes')`. The function can return either `None` or a tuple containing `div` and `rem`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, a is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters, and b is a string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(func_5())):
        func_1()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, and `func_1()` has been executed at least `int(func_5())` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)), `k` (an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\)), and `a` and `b` (strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters). It first calls `func_5` to determine the number of iterations for a loop. For each iteration, it calls `func_1`. After the loop, it returns no explicit value, but implies that `func_1` processes the strings `a` and `b` based on the value of `k`. If any of the constraints on `t`, `n`, or `k` are not satisfied, it should return an error message, but since no such check is explicitly coded, it is assumed that the function proceeds without checking these constraints unless `func_5` or `func_1` fails. The final state of the program is that `a` and `b` have potentially been processed by `func_1` multiple times, depending on the output of `func_5`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^5. For each test case, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^6, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to n, sep, file, end, and flush are optional keyword arguments passed to the print function, where sep specifies the separator between values, file specifies the output stream, end specifies the string appended after the last value, and flush specifies whether to forcibly flush the stream.
def func_3():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the content written to the file (concatenation of `sep` and all elements of `args`), `at_start` is `False`, `end` and `flush` remain as optional keyword arguments passed to the print function, `args` is an empty collection.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the content written to the file (concatenation of `sep` and `end`), `at_start` is `False`, `end` is `\n`, `flush` remains unchanged, and `args` is an empty collection. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, then the function will flush the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` takes no explicit arguments directly but relies on `args` and `kwargs` to perform its operations. It concatenates the string representations of elements in `args` with a specified separator (`sep`) and writes them to the given output stream (`file`). After the loop, it appends the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the output stream and, if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the output stream. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty or when `kwargs` does not contain certain keys. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `file` contains the concatenated strings from `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`, and the output stream is flushed if `flush` is `True`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop has been executed, the function returns `x` as the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` as 0. This is achieved through a while loop that repeatedly updates `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` holds the GCD. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0 initially, as the loop will terminate immediately without performing any iterations. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and the annotations accurately describe the state of the program after its execution.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a and b are strings of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    #`sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')` which reads an integer representing the number of test cases from standard input and removes any trailing newline character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer representing the number of test cases from standard input and removes any trailing newline character. There are no additional parameters accepted by the function, and it returns the integer read from the input. No further processing or validation of the input is performed within the function.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
