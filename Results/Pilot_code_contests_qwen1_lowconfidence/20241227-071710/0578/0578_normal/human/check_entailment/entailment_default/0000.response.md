Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to determine if it is possible to convert string `a` into string `b` using the allowed operations, but it does not correctly handle all cases. 

Let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **Case 1**: If string `a` is already equal to string `b`, the function should return "Yes". However, the current implementation does not check for this condition, so it might incorrectly return "No".

2. **Case 2**: If the strings `a` and `b` are different but can be converted by swapping adjacent characters, the function should return "Yes". However, the current implementation focuses solely on the second operation (incrementing sequences of characters), which might miss cases where swapping adjacent characters is sufficient.

3. **Case 3**: If the strings `a` and `b` differ in a way that cannot be corrected by the given operations, the function should return "No". However, the current implementation does not properly handle such cases, potentially leading to incorrect results.

To fix these issues, the function needs to incorporate logic to check for both conditions (swapping adjacent characters and incrementing sequences) and ensure it correctly handles all possible transformations.

Since the provided code does not cover all necessary cases and does not return the correct result for some inputs, the correctness is **False**.
