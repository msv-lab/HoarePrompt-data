You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on values obtained from calling `func_5()` and uses a `Counter` to count character frequencies in string `s`. It processes string `t` to find substrings of consecutive identical characters, then iterates over these substrings. For each substring, it calculates `div` (integer division of the substring's length by `k`) and `rem` (remainder). It checks if the frequency of the first character in the substring in `freq` is less than `rem`. If so, it calls `func_3('No')` and returns. Otherwise, it updates the frequency count in `freq` and attempts to find a character with sufficient frequency to cover the `div` part of the substring. If no such character is found, it again calls `func_3('No')` and returns. If all checks pass, it calls `func_3('Yes')`. The function can return either `None` or a tuple containing `div` and `rem`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(func_5())):
        func_1()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\)), `k` (an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq n\)), and `a` and `b` (strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters). It first calls `func_5` to determine the number of iterations for a loop. For each iteration, it calls `func_1`. After the loop, it returns no explicit value, but implies that `func_1` processes the strings `a` and `b` based on the value of `k`. If any of the constraints on `t`, `n`, or `k` are not satisfied, it should return an error message, but since no such check is explicitly coded, it is assumed that the function proceeds without checking these constraints unless `func_5` or `func_1` fails. The final state of the program is that `a` and `b` have potentially been processed by `func_1` multiple times, depending on the output of `func_5`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(*args, **kwargs):
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))

        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` takes no explicit arguments directly but relies on `args` and `kwargs` to perform its operations. It concatenates the string representations of elements in `args` with a specified separator (`sep`) and writes them to the given output stream (`file`). After the loop, it appends the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the output stream and, if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the output stream. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty or when `kwargs` does not contain certain keys. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `file` contains the concatenated strings from `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`, and the output stream is flushed if `flush` is `True`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop has been executed, the function returns `x` as the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` as 0. This is achieved through a while loop that repeatedly updates `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` holds the GCD. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0 initially, as the loop will terminate immediately without performing any iterations. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code, and the annotations accurately describe the state of the program after its execution.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads an integer representing the number of test cases from standard input and removes any trailing newline character. There are no additional parameters accepted by the function, and it returns the integer read from the input. No further processing or validation of the input is performed within the function.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
