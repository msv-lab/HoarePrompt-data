The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but relies on values obtained from calling `func_5()` and uses a `Counter` to count character frequencies in string `s`. It processes string `t` to find substrings of consecutive identical characters, then iterates over these substrings. For each substring, it calculates `div` (integer division of the substring's length by `k`) and `rem` (remainder). It checks if the frequency of the first character in the substring in `freq` is less than `rem`. If so, it calls `func_3('No')` and returns. Otherwise, it updates the frequency count in `freq` and attempts to find a character with sufficient frequency to cover the `div` part of the substring. If no such character is found, it again calls `func_3('No')` and returns. If all checks pass, it calls `func_3('Yes')`. The function can return either `None` or a tuple containing `div` and `rem`.
