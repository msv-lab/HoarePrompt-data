The function `func_3()` takes no explicit arguments directly but relies on `args` and `kwargs` to perform its operations. It concatenates the string representations of elements in `args` with a specified separator (`sep`) and writes them to the given output stream (`file`). After the loop, it appends the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the output stream and, if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the output stream. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `args` is empty or when `kwargs` does not contain certain keys. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `file` contains the concatenated strings from `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`, and the output stream is flushed if `flush` is `True`.
