Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list, `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`. The value of `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is reduced by `div` where `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 3`, if `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`. If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is less than `div`, the value of `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains unchanged.***
