Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `groups` is a non-empty list.
- `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`.
- `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`.
- `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.

### Loop Condition:
- If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, then:
  - `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is reduced by `div`.
  - The loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `func_3('No')` is called and the function returns.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is not greater than or equal to `div`.
   - If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` becomes less than `div` during the loop, the loop will break.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `groups` is non-empty.
   - `div` and `rem` are calculated based on the length of `groups` and `k`.
   - `freq[group[0]]` is initially updated by subtracting `rem`.

3. **Effect of Loop Execution**:
   - Each iteration of the loop checks the frequency of `string.ascii_lowercase[i]`.
   - If the frequency is already less than `div`, the loop will not enter the condition where it reduces the frequency further.
   - The loop will break if `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is reduced to less than `div` before checking all elements in `groups`.

4. **State Adjustments for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` must still be greater than or equal to `div` for some `i`.
   - Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should ensure that `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` remains at least `div` for at least one element in `groups`.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `groups` is still a non-empty list.
- `div` remains the same (integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`).
- `rem` remains the same (remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`).
- `freq[group[0]]` needs to be such that it is greater than or equal to `div` for at least one element in `groups`.

### Example Answer:
State: **`groups` is a non-empty list, `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`, and `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem` but must be greater than or equal to `div` for at least one element in `groups`.**

This ensures that the loop can continue executing at least one more time.
