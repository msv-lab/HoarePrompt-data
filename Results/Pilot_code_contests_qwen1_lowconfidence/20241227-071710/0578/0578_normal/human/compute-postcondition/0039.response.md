Let's break down the given information and the loop statement to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `groups` is a non-empty list.
- `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`.
- `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`.
- The postcondition remains unchanged when `div` does not equal 0.
- If `div` equals 0, `freq[group[0]]` is decreased by `rem`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Involved**: The loop uses `i` as an index and references `group[0]` (the first element of the `group` list).

2. **Initial State**:
   - `groups` is a non-empty list.
   - `div` and `rem` are calculated based on the length of `groups` and `k`.
   - `freq` is a dictionary, and we know how `freq[group[0]]` might change if `div == 0`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and decrements until `-1`.
   - This means the loop will iterate over indices in reverse order starting from the position of `group[0]` in `string.ascii_lowercase` minus one, going down to 0.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` must be greater than 0. Otherwise, the range would be invalid (no elements to iterate over).
   - We need to ensure `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase` since `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is being used.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the following states:

- `groups` must be a non-empty list.
- `group[0]` must exist in `string.ascii_lowercase` such that `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is valid (greater than 0).

### Final Answer:
State: **`groups` is a non-empty list, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase` and its index is greater than 0**
