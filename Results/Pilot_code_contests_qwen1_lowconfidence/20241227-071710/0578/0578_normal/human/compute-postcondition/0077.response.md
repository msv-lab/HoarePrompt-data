The function `func_3('Yes')` is called, which implies that the loop does not execute and the function `func_3('No')` is called instead. This function call does not modify the `freq` variable. The states of the other variables (`groups`, `div`, `rem`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings consisting of consecutive identical characters from string `t`, `div` is the integer division of the length of each substring in `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of each substring in `groups` divided by `k`, `freq` is the updated frequency count of characters in string `s` before the loop (unchanged), and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is the index of the first character in each group.**
