Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` must be at least 1, and `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`. If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, then `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is further decreased by `div`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
