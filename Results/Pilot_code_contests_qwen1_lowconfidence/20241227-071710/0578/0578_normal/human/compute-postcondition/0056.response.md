The function `func_3('No')` is called, but the definition of `func_3` is not provided. Since the function call does not directly assign a value to any of the existing variables (`groups`, `group[0]`, `index`, `div`, `rem`), and no side effects on these variables are described, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, the index of `group[0]` is `index`, `div` is `len(group) // k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`**
