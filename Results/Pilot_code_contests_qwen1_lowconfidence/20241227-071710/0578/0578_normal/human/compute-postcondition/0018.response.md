Let's analyze the loop step-by-step and determine the final output state after all iterations have completed.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
- `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`.
- `at_start` is `True`.
- `end` and `flush` remain as optional keyword arguments passed to the print function.
- `args` is a collection (list or tuple) of elements.

### Loop Code
```python
for x in args:
    if not at_start:
        file.write(sep)
    file.write(str(x))
    at_start = False
```

### Observations from the First Few Iterations
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `at_start` is set to `False` after the first write operation.
   - `file` now includes the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.
   - `args` is a non-empty collection, and `x` is the first element.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `at_start` remains `False` because it was set to `False` in the previous iteration.
   - `file` now includes the string representation of `sep` followed by the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.
   - `args` is a collection with at least one less element than before.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `at_start` remains `False`.
   - `file` now includes the string representation of `sep` followed by the string representation of the second element of `args`.
   - `args` is a collection with at least one less element than before.

### General Pattern
- After each iteration, `file` contains the concatenated string representations of `sep` and the remaining elements of `args`.
- `at_start` remains `False` throughout the loop.
- `args` loses one element per iteration until it is empty.

### Final State After All Iterations
- If `args` is not empty, the loop will continue until `args` is exhausted.
- `file` will contain the concatenation of `sep` and all elements of `args` written as strings.
- `at_start` will be `False` since it is set to `False` after the first write operation and remains unchanged.
- `args` will be an empty collection (i.e., `[]`).

### Conclusion
- If `args` is empty, `file` will still be the same as its initial state (`kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`).
- `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` retain their final states as described above.

### Output State
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the content written to the file (concatenation of `sep` and all elements of `args`), `at_start` is `False`, `end` and `flush` remain as optional keyword arguments passed to the print function, `args` is an empty collection.**
