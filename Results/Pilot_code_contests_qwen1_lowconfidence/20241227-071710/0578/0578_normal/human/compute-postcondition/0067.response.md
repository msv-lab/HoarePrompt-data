To determine the updated states at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements.
- `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`.
- `div = len(group) // k`, where `k` is some constant.
- `rem = len(group) % k`.
- `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` must be at least 1.
- If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is decreased by `div`.
- If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is less than `i`, no change occurs to `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` and we break out of the loop.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` down to `-1`. This means it starts from the position just before the first character in `group` and goes backwards until it reaches the start of the alphabet (position -1).

2. **Initial State**:
   - `groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements.
   - `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`.
   - `freq[group[0]]` has already been decremented by `rem`.
   - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is at least 1.
   - The loop has started iterating from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.

3. **First Iteration**:
   - At the end of the first iteration, `i` will be set to `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.

4. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each subsequent iteration, `i` will decrement by 1.

### Updated States:
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

### Updated State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `groups` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `group[0]` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `freq[group[0]]` is already decremented by `rem`.
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is decremented by 1 from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` must be at least 1, and `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`**.
