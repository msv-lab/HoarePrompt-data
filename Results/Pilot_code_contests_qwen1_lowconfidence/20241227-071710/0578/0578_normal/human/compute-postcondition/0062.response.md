Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements.
   - `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`.
   - `div = len(group) // k`.
   - `rem = len(group) % k`.
   - `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop runs for values of `i` starting from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` until `-1` with a step of `-1`.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute, the initial value of `i` should be valid (i.e., `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` should be a non-negative integer).
   - Since the loop decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`, `i` must start from a value such that the loop body can run at least once.

4. **Key Points to Consider**:
   - The loop will start from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and continue until `-1`.
   - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` returns the index of the character `group[0]` in the string `string.ascii_lowercase`.
   - Therefore, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` must be a non-negative integer.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Ensure `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` is a valid index, meaning it should be greater than or equal to 0.

Given these points, the required adjustments are:
- Ensure that `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` is a valid starting point for the loop, which means `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state needed to be adjusted is:

**State: **`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `div = len(group) // k`, `rem = len(group) % k`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` must be at least 1**.
