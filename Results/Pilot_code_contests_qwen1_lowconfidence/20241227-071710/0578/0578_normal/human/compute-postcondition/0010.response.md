Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` and `flush` remain as optional keyword arguments passed to the print function, `args` is a collection with at least one less element than before, and either the file object has had `sep` written to it (if `not at_start` is true) or the state remains unchanged (if `not at_start` is false).***
