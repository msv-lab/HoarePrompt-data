The function `func_3` is called with the argument `'No'`. However, there is no definition or impact of the function `func_3` provided in the given code snippet. Without knowing what `func_3` does, we cannot determine how the variables are affected.

Given the lack of information about the function `func_3`, we can only state the current conditions and note that the function call might modify the state of the program, but the specific changes are unknown.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list, `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`, and `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem` but must be greater than or equal to `div` for at least one element in `groups`. The new value of `rem` is the remainder when the length of `groups` is divided by `k`. A function call `func_3('No')` has been made, but its effect on the variables is unknown.**
