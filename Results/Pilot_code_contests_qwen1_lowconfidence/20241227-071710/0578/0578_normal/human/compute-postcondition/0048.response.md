Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `groups` is a non-empty list.
  - `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`.
  - The index of `group[0]` is `index`.
  - If the frequency of `string.ascii_lowercase[index - 1]` is initially greater than or equal to `div`, its frequency is reduced by `div`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization:**
   - The loop starts from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and goes down to `-1` (inclusive).
   - The loop variable `i` will take values from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` to `0`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to check if the loop can continue to the next iteration.
   - Since the loop is iterating in reverse, the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration would be `0` (assuming the loop ran for all possible values).

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `groups` is a non-empty list.
   - `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`.
   - The index of `group[0]` is `index`.
   - The frequency of `string.ascii_lowercase[index - 1]` might have been reduced if it was initially greater than or equal to `div`.

2. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - To continue the loop, `i` needs to be greater than `-1`.
   - Since the loop started from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and went down to `-1`, the loop will not execute again if `i` is `-1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than `-1`, meaning we need to start the loop from a value greater than `-1`.

However, based on the given loop initialization and the fact that the loop variable `i` would have reached `-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop cannot execute one more time because `i` is already `-1`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time. The state remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`groups` is a non-empty list, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, the index of `group[0]` is `index`, and the frequency of `string.ascii_lowercase[index - 1]` might have been reduced if it was initially greater than or equal to `div`.**
