The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the given output cases, the function processes some internal logic and returns different outputs depending on certain conditions.

- Case_1: The function returns `None`.
- Case_2: The function returns two values: the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, and the remainder when the length of `groups` is divided by `k`.
- Case_3: The function returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to either return `None` or return two specific values based on the length of `groups` and the integer `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, and returns `None` in Case_1 and Case_3, and returns the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k` and the remainder when the length of `groups` is divided by `k` in Case_2.**
