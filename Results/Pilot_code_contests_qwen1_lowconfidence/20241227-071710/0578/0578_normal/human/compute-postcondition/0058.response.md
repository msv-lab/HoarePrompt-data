Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `div` is `len(group) // k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`. If `freq[group[0]]` is less than `rem`, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (implying the postcondition remains the same as the precondition).***
