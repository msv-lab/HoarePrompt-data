Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the content written to the file (concatenation of `sep` and `end`), `at_start` is `False`, `end` is `\n`, `flush` is `True`, `args` is an empty collection.***

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and specifies that `flush` is `True` because the if condition checks if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is truthy, which it is when explicitly set to `True`.
