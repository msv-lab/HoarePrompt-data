Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `div` is `len(group) // k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, and `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`. If `div == 0`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged since there is no else part provided.***
