The function `func_4` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. The function returns `x`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, both non-negative integers, and returns x as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, with y being 0.**
