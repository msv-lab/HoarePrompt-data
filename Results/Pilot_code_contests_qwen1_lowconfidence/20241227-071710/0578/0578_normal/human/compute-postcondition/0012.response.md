The code `at_start = False` simply updates the value of `at_start` to `False`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` now includes the string representation of `x` appended to its current content (if `not at_start` is true), `at_start` is `False`, `end` and `flush` remain as optional keyword arguments passed to the print function, `args` is a collection with at least one less element than before**
