Functionality: **The function reads an integer representing the number of test cases from standard input and removes any trailing newline character. There are no additional parameters accepted by the function, and it returns the integer read from the input. No further processing or validation of the input is performed within the function.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input provided by the user is not a valid integer, the behavior of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')` is undefined, and it might raise a `ValueError`. However, the function itself does not handle this case.
- If the input stream is empty or closed before reading, the function will attempt to read from an empty buffer, which might result in an immediate end-of-file condition or other I/O errors, depending on the underlying system.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate the input to ensure it falls within the expected range (i.e., the integer should be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to \(10^6\)).
- There is no error handling mechanism to manage scenarios where the input is invalid or unexpected.
