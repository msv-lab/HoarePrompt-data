Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list, `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, and `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`. If `div` equals 0, `freq[group[0]]` is decreased by `rem`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when `div` does not equal 0.***
