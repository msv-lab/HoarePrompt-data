`rem` is assigned the remainder of dividing `len(group)` by `k`. The value of `len(group)` is not specified exactly, but it is known that `div` is `len(group) // k`, which means `len(group)` can be expressed as `k * div + rem`. Since `len(group)` is a non-negative integer, `rem` will be an integer such that `0 <= rem < k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, the index of `group[0]` is `index`, `div` is `len(group) // k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`**
