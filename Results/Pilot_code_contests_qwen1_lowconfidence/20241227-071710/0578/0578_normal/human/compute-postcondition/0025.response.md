To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and analyze the loop condition:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `groups` is a non-empty list.
   - `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`.
   - `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`.
   - `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is adjusted either by subtracting `div` if the condition is met or remains unchanged if the condition is not met.
   - `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it involves adjusting `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` based on some condition.
   - The loop may also break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement if applicable.

4. **Key Variables:**
   - `i` starts from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

5. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1, making it `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 3`.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute one more time:

- `i` should be `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 3`.
- All other states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`groups` is a non-empty list, `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is adjusted either by subtracting `div` if the condition is met or remains unchanged if the condition is not met, and `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 3`.**
