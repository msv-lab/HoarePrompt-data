Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list of substrings consisting of consecutive identical characters from string `t`, `div` is the integer division of the length of each substring in `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of each substring in `groups` divided by `k`, `freq` is the updated frequency count of characters in string `s` after the loop, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is the index of the first character in each group. If the loop executes, the frequency of characters in `freq` will be reduced accordingly based on the conditions in the loop. If the loop does not execute, the function will call `func_3('No')` and return without modifying `freq`.**
