The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the current loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional was specified in the provided code snippet, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current context (which is implied but not explicitly stated).

Given the initial state and the fact that no further operations are performed, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list, `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is reduced by `div` where `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 3`, and `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 3`.**
