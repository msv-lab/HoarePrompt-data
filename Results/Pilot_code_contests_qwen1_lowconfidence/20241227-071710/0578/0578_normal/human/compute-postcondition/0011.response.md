The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file specified by `file`. However, the value of `x` is not provided in the initial state. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, we cannot determine the exact content written to the file. But we can state that `file` now contains the string representation of `x` appended to its current content.

Other variables remain unchanged. So, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`
- `file` now includes the string representation of `x` appended to its current content (if `not at_start` is true)
- `at_start` is `False`
- `end` and `flush` remain as optional keyword arguments passed to the print function
- `args` is a collection with at least one less element than before

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` now includes the string representation of `x` appended to its current content (if `not at_start` is true), `at_start` is `False`, `end` and `flush` remain as optional keyword arguments passed to the print function, `args` is a collection with at least one less element than before**
