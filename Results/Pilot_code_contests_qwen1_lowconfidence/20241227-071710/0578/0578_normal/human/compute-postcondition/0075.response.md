Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `div = len(group) // k`, `rem = len(group) % k`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` must be at least 1. If the loop executes, the final value of `i` will be the largest index in `string.ascii_lowercase` such that `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`. If no such index exists, `func_3('No')` is called and the function returns. Otherwise, the final value of `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` will be the original value minus `div * count`, where `count` is the number of times the decrement operation was performed. If the loop does not execute, `i` will remain `-1` and no changes will be made to `freq`.**
