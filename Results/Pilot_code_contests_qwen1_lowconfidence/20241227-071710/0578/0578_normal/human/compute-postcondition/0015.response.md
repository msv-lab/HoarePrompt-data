Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` now includes the string representation of `sep` appended to its current content, `at_start` is `False`, `end` and `flush` remain as optional keyword arguments passed to the print function, `args` is a collection with at least one element***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we assume that the condition in the if statement is always true based on the given information. Therefore, the postcondition follows the description of the if part, where `file` now includes the string representation of `sep` appended to its current content.
