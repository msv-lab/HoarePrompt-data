Postcondition: **`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `div = len(group) // k`, `rem = len(group) % k`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, and `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` must be at least 1. Additionally, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`.**
