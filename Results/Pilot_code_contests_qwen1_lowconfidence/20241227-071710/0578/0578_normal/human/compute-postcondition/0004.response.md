According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x % y`.

For the loop to continue executing, `y` must be non-zero. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `y` is not zero.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `x % y`.
2. For the loop to continue, `y` must be non-zero (`y != 0`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `y` is not zero.

State: **`x` is `y`, `y` is `x % y` and `y` must be non-zero**
