The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not change any variables or have any effect on the program state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `div` is `len(group) // k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.**
