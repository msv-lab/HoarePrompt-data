Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list, `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`, and `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`. If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is reduced by `div` and the loop breaks. If the loop does not break, `func_3('No')` is called and the function returns.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the ASCII lowercase characters starting from `group[0]` in reverse order.
- If the frequency of the current character (`freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]`) is greater than or equal to `div`, the frequency is reduced by `div` and the loop breaks.
- If the loop does not break (meaning none of the frequencies satisfy the condition), `func_3('No')` is called, indicating that the operation could not be completed as expected.

Since the loop either breaks or calls `func_3('No')`, the final state depends on whether the condition inside the loop is met or not. If the loop breaks, the frequency of the corresponding character is reduced. If the loop does not break, the function returns with an error message.
