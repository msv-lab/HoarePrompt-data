The `continue` statement in the given code does not change any variable values or affect the state of the variables. It merely skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if it is inside one) and continues with the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `groups`, `div`, `rem`, or `freq[group[0]]`, the values remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list, `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`, and `freq[group[0]]` is decreased by `rem`.**
