The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the program by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the `file`. Since `end` is an optional keyword argument passed to the `print` function and its default value is `\n`, it means `end` will be written to the file.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
- `file` is the content written to the file (concatenation of `sep` and all elements of `args`).
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `end` and `flush` remain as optional keyword arguments passed to the print function.
- `args` is an empty collection.

After executing the code, `file` will have the `end` value written to it. Since the default value of `end` is `\n`, `file` will now contain the concatenation of `sep` and `end`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\) inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\) inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` is the content written to the file (concatenation of `sep` and `end`), `at_start` is `False`, `end` is `\n`, `flush` remains as an optional keyword argument passed to the print function, `args` is an empty collection.**
