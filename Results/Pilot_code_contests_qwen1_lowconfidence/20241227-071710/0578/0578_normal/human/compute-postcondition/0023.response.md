The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly listed in its definition. It only has default parameters for the `print` function (`sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`). However, based on the problem statement, the function should accept `t`, `n`, and `k` as parameters.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to \(10^5\).
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to \(10^6\).
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`.

The function will use these parameters, but since they are not present in the function signature, we infer them from the problem statement. The function will return something based on the provided cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. It uses these parameters to perform some operations and returns a value based on certain conditions.**

Given the output cases:
- **Case_1:** If `k` is less than `n/2`, the function returns "First Half".
- **Case_2:** If `k` is greater than or equal to `n/2`, the function returns "Second Half".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, and based on the value of `k` relative to `n/2`, it returns either "First Half" or "Second Half".

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. If `k` is less than `n/2`, it returns "First Half". If `k` is greater than or equal to `n/2`, it returns "Second Half".**
