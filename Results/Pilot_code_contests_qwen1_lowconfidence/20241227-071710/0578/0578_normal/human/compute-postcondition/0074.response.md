Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements. If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` (where `i` is `-1`) is greater than or equal to `div`, then `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[-1]]` is decreased by `div`, and `i` is `-1' and we break out of the most internal loop or switch statement. Otherwise, no changes occur to `freq` and `i` remains `-1`.***
