Postcondition: ***`groups` is a non-empty list, `div` is the integer division of the length of `groups` by `k`, and `rem` is the remainder of the length of `groups` divided by `k`. If `freq[group[0]] < rem`, the function returns `div` and `rem`. Otherwise, no change is made to `div` and `rem`.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts as specified.
