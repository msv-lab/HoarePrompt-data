`freq[group[0]]` is decremented by `rem`. The precondition states that `freq[group[0]]` is greater than or equal to `rem`, so this operation is valid and `freq[group[0]]` will now be `freq[group[0]] - rem`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `group[0]` exists in `string.ascii_lowercase`, `div` is `len(group) // k`, `rem` is `len(group) % k`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.**
