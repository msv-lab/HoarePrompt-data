The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of its digits as individual integers. Specifically, the function converts the integer `n` into a string, iterates over each character in the string representation, and converts each character back into an integer, returning a list of these integers. This process works for any non-negative integer `n`. However, it should be noted that the function assumes `n` is a non-negative integer and does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs. Additionally, the function does not perform any error checking for invalid input types, so passing non-integer values will result in unexpected behavior.
