n is an integer representing the number of columns in the Young diagram, m is an integer representing the number of rows in the Young diagram, and num is an integer representing the height of each row in the Young diagram generated by the function. However, this function does not seem to be directly related to solving the problem of finding the largest number of non-overlapping dominos in the Young diagram.
