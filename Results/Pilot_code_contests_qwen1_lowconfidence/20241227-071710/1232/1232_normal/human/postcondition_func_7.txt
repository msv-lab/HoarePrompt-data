The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of non-negative integers, where the length of the list represents the number of columns in a Young diagram, and each element in the list represents the length of a column (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 300,000, a_i ≥ a_{i+1}). The function sorts the elements in `l` in ascending order and returns the sorted list. The function does not modify the original list `l` but instead returns a new sorted list. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, and the provided code performs the described action accurately.
