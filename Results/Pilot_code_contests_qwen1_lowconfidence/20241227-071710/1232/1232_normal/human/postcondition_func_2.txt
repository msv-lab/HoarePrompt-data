The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and converts them into a list of integers. This list represents the lengths of columns in a Young diagram, where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 300,000\) and \(a_i \geq a_{i+1}\) for all valid indices. The function returns this list. Note that the function does not perform any validation on the input to ensure that the list is in non-increasing order or that each integer is within the specified range; it simply reads and returns the list as provided by the user.
