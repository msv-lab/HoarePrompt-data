Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code in `func_17` does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can be drawn inside the Young diagram. The code iterates over the list `a` and calculates two values `w` and `b` based on the parity of the index `i`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos is found. Specifically, the code assumes that the optimal solution can be achieved by splitting the columns in a specific manner based on the parity of the index, which is not always true.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following Young diagram with the column lengths `[3, 2, 2, 2, 1]`:

- If we split the columns based on the parity of the index, we would get:
  - For even indices: `w += (a[i] + 1) // 2`
  - For odd indices: `b += a[i] // 2`

This would result in:
- `w = (3 + 1) // 2 + (2 + 1) // 2 + 2 // 2 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`
- `b = 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + (2 + 1) // 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

The function then returns the minimum of `w` and `b`, which is 3. However, the correct answer for this Young diagram is 4, as shown in the problem description's example.

A more accurate approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers all possible ways to place the dominos and selects the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos.
