Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code for `func_17` does not correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can fit in a Young diagram. The logic in the function does not account for the actual placement of dominos, which must cover two adjacent columns or rows in the diagram.

Specifically, the function calculates `w` and `b` based on alternating indices, which does not reflect the actual area covered by dominos. This approach fails to consider the optimal placement of dominos to maximize their count. For instance, in a Young diagram where multiple columns have the same height, the current logic may not maximize the number of dominos placed.

A correct solution would involve more sophisticated logic to determine the optimal placement of dominos, considering both horizontal and vertical placements. The current implementation is flawed and does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
