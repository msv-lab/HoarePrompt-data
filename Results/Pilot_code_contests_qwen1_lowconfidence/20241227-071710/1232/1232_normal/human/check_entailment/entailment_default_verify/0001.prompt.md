You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a Young diagram. 

Given diagram is a histogram with n columns of lengths a_1, a_2, …, a_n (a_1 ≥ a_2 ≥ … ≥ a_n ≥ 1).

<image> Young diagram for a=[3,2,2,2,1].

Your goal is to find the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of this histogram, a domino is a 1 × 2 or 2 × 1 rectangle.

Input

The first line of input contain one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300 000): the number of columns in the given histogram.

The next line of input contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 300 000, a_i ≥ a_{i+1}): the lengths of columns.

Output

Output one integer: the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of the given Young diagram.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos in a Young diagram. The functions defined in the code are utility functions that do not contribute to solving the main problem. Specifically, the code does not include any logic to process the input histogram and calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed inside it.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
1. Read the input values for the histogram.
2. Calculate the number of dominos that can be placed horizontally and vertically.
3. Return the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos.

Since the provided code does not include any of these steps, it cannot correctly solve the problem for any input, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 18 : This function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. It is a utility function for printing a sequence of strings to a file object (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). The function takes an iterable `args` of strings and prints them to the specified file, separated by a space character. After the iteration, it writes an end character (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the buffer if specified. If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the buffer is flushed immediately. If the `flush` parameter is `False` or not provided, the buffer remains unflushed.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
