Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos in a Young diagram. The functions defined in the code are utility functions that do not contribute to solving the main problem. Specifically, the code does not include any logic to process the input histogram and calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed inside it.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
1. Read the input values for the histogram.
2. Calculate the number of dominos that can be placed horizontally and vertically.
3. Return the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos.

Since the provided code does not include any of these steps, it cannot correctly solve the problem for any input, making it incorrect.
