The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000 and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer to binary and then removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code performs the exact action described.
