The function `func_13` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It calculates the result of \(x^y \mod p\) using a method known as exponentiation by squaring. The function first reduces `x` modulo `p`. Then, it iteratively squares `x` and multiplies it into the result (`res`) whenever `y` is odd. The loop continues until `y` becomes zero. After the loop, the function returns `res`, which is the final result of \(x^y \mod p\).
