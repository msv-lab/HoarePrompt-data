Precondition: **The function does not utilize any arguments provided in its signature that are relevant to solving the problem described. Instead, it appears to be a utility function for printing, which is not related to the problem of finding the largest number of non-overlapping dominos in a Young diagram. The actual implementation for solving the problem is missing from the given code snippet.**

Based on the problem description, the function should take the lengths of the columns of the Young diagram as input and return the maximum number of non-overlapping dominos that can be placed within the diagram. However, the provided `func_18` function does not seem to contribute to this calculation and instead seems to be a print utility function.
