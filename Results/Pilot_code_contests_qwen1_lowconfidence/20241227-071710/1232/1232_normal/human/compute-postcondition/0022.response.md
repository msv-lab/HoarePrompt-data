`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the output buffer of `sys.stdout`. Since the initial state indicates that `sys.stdout` may have been flushed based on the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)`, calling `file.flush()` again will ensure that the buffer is flushed. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has had its buffer flushed, the result of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is considered, meaning `kwargs` may or may not contain the key `'flush'` depending on its initial state.**
