`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space character) to `file`. The value of `sep` is a space character, so this operation writes a space to `sys.stdout`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least two more elements, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character.**
