The code `at_start = False` simply reassigns the value of `at_start` to `False`. Since this is the only line of code and it does not depend on any other variables or perform any operations that would change the state of other variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character, and then writes another `str(x)`**
