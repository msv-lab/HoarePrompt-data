The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Given the initial state, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`. The previous state of the variables is as follows:

- `at_start` is `False`
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`
- `sep` is a space character
- `file` is `sys.stdout`
- `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least two more elements
- `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character, and then writes another `str(x)`

After executing `file.write(str(x))`, `sys.stdout` will write the string representation of `x` to itself (the console). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least two more elements, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character, and then writes another `str(x)`, and `sys.stdout` has additionally written `str(x)`.**
