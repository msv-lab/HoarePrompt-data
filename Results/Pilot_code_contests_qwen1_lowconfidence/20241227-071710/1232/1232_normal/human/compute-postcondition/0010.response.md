`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space character) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). The previous value of `sys.stdout` had written `str(x)` to it. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` and a space character to it.**
