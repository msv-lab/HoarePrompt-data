`at_start` is reassigned to `False`, which does not change its current value since it was already `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least two more elements, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character, and then writes another `str(x)`, and `sys.stdout` has additionally written `str(x).**
