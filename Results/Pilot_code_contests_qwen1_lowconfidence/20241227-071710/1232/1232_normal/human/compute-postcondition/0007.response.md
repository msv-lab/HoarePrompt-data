`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since the initial state specifies that `file` is `sys.stdout`, this operation writes `str(x)` to the standard output. The initial state also mentions that `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, and `file` is `sys.stdout`. The state of `args` and `at_start` does not change because the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` to it.**
