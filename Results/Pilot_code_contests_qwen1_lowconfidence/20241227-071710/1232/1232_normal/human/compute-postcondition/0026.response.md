The function `func_17` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers. The integer `n` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, and each element `a[i]` in the list satisfies the constraints 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 300,000 and a[i] ≥ a[i+1]. 

The function does not return any explicit value based on the provided information. Therefore, the return value is not specified in the given output cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 300,000 and each element `a[i]` in the list satisfies the constraints 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 300,000 and a[i] ≥ a[i+1]. The return value is not specified.**
