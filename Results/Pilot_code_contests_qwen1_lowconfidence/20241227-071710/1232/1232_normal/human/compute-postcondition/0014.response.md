Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `at_start` is `False`.
   - `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'.
   - `sep` is a space character.
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
   - `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element.
   - `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character, and then writes another `str(x)`.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `args`.

3. **Key Variables and Their Changes:**
   - `at_start` remains `False` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `kwargs` no longer contains 'sep' and 'file', so this does not change.
   - `sep` remains a space character unless explicitly changed inside the loop.
   - `file` remains `sys.stdout` unless explicitly changed inside the loop.
   - `args` loses one element per iteration (since `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element).
   - `sys.stdout` writes `str(x)` followed by a space character, and then writes another `str(x)`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element.
   - `sys.stdout` will write the next element of `args` followed by a space character, and then another `str(x)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the following changes:

- `args` must now be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element (one less than before).
- `sys.stdout` will write the next element of `args` followed by a space character, and then another `str(x)`.

So, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least two more elements, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character, and then writes another `str(x)`**
