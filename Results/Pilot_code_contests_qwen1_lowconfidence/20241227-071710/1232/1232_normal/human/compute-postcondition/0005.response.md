The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space character) into `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). No other variables are affected. 

Output State: **`kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` must be a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has a space written to it.**
