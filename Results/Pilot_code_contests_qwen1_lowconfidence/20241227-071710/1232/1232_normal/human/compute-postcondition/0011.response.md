Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part directly serves as the overall postcondition. The if condition does not change the fact that `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character.
