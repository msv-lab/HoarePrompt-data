Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has written the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args` separated by a space followed by a newline character, the result of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is considered, meaning `kwargs` may or may not contain the key `'flush'` depending on its initial state, and `sys.stdout` may have been flushed based on the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)`***
