Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has written the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args` separated by a space.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the `args` iterable.
- Initially, `at_start` is set to `True`.
- On the first iteration, `at_start` becomes `False`, and the first element `x` is written to `file` without a leading separator (since `at_start` is now `False`).
- On subsequent iterations, `at_start` remains `False`, and each `str(x)` is written to `file` followed by the `sep` value, which is a space character.
- After all iterations, `at_start` is guaranteed to be `False`, as the loop sets it to `False` after the first write operation and leaves it unchanged thereafter.
- The `kwargs` dictionary is modified to remove the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` before the loop starts.
- `sep` remains a space character throughout the loop.
- `file` remains `sys.stdout` throughout the loop.
- `args` must be a non-empty iterable to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- `sys.stdout` will have written the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args`, with each element separated by a space.
