Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has had its buffer flushed if `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, otherwise, `sys.stdout` remains in its original state with the buffer containing the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args` separated by a space followed by a newline character.***
