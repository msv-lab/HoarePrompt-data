Functionality: **This function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. It is a utility function for printing a sequence of strings to a file object (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). The function takes an iterable `args` of strings and prints them to the specified file, separated by a space character. After the iteration, it writes an end character (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the buffer if specified. If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the buffer is flushed immediately. If the `flush` parameter is `False` or not provided, the buffer remains unflushed.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `args` is empty, nothing will be printed.
- If `kwargs` contains invalid keys such as `'sep'` or `'file'` with incorrect types, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
- If `kwargs` contains a key `'flush'` with an invalid type, the function will also raise a `TypeError`.

Missing Functionality:
- The function does not perform any calculations or operations related to finding the largest number of non-overlapping dominos in a Young diagram, as mentioned in the problem description.
