The code writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Given the initial state, `sys.stdout` has already written `str(x)` followed by a space character. After executing the code snippet, `sys.stdout` will write another `str(x)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character, and then writes another `str(x)`.**
