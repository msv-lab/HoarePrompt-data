Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` must be a non-empty iterable with at least two more elements, `sys.stdout` has written `str(x)` followed by a space character, and then writes another `str(x)`. Since the if condition `not at_start` is always true given the precondition, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
