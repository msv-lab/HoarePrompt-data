The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the following:
- `kwargs` is popped for the key `'end'` with a default value of `\n`. Since `'sep'` and `'file'` were already removed from `kwargs`, `'end'` is now popped.
- `file.write` writes the value associated with `'end'` (which is `\n` by default) to `sys.stdout`.

Given the initial state:
- `at_start` is `False`
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`
- `sep` is a space character
- `file` is `sys.stdout`
- `args` is a non-empty iterable
- `sys.stdout` has written the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args` separated by a space.

After executing the code:
- `kwargs` is updated to remove the key `'end'`.
- `sys.stdout` writes a newline character `\n`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'`, `sep` is a space character, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `sys.stdout` has written the concatenation of `str(x)` for each `x` in `args` separated by a space followed by a newline character.**
