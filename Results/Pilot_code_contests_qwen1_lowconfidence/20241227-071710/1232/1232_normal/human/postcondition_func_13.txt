The function `func_14` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where both are non-negative integers and `x >= y > 0`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function returns the GCD, which is stored in `x` when `y` becomes 0. This process continues until `y` is reduced to 0, at which point `x` holds the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`. Potential edge cases include when `x` or `y` is 0 initially; in such cases, the function correctly returns `x` as the GCD. The function also handles the case where `x` and `y` are equal, reducing to the same process.
