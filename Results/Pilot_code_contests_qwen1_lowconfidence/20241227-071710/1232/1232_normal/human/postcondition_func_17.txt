This function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. It is a utility function for printing a sequence of strings to a file object (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). The function takes an iterable `args` of strings and prints them to the specified file, separated by a space character. After the iteration, it writes an end character (defaulting to a newline) and flushes the buffer if specified. If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the buffer is flushed immediately. If the `flush` parameter is `False` or not provided, the buffer remains unflushed.
