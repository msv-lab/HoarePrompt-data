The function `func_4` accepts no parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input, expecting a space-separated list of integers. Each integer in the list is assumed to be within the range [1, 300,000] and the list is non-increasing. The function then converts each integer in the input into a string, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns a map object containing these string representations.
