The function `func_15` accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 300,000), representing the number of columns in a Young diagram. It checks several conditions to determine whether `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3. If `n` meets these conditions, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 3, or divisible by 2 or 3.
