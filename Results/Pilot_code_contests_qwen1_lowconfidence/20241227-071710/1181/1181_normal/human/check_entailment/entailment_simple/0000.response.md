Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates and prints `-r` instead of `r`, which is incorrect based on the problem description.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( r \):**
   - The program correctly computes \( r \) using the formula:
     \[
     r = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \times 2^i (2^{n-2i-1} - 1) \mod (1000000000 + 7)
     \]
   - However, the final result is printed as `-r` instead of `r`.

2. **Output:**
   - According to the problem description, the output should be the value of \( r \) modulo \( 1000000000 + 7 \).
   - The program prints `-r`, which is incorrect because it should print `r` directly.

### Why It Does Not Follow the Problem Description:
- The problem requires the sum of \( F(a) \) for all non-empty subsets \( a \) of the set of hacked computers. The formula used in the program is correct for calculating \( r \), but the final output is incorrect because it prints `-r` instead of `r`.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix this issue, simply remove the `-` sign before printing `r`:
```python
print(r)
```

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    r = 0
    for i in range(n):
        r += s[i] * (2 ** (n - 1 - i) - 1 - (2 ** i - 1)) % (1000000000 + 7)
    print(r)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly compute and print the required sum modulo \( 1000000000 + 7 \).
