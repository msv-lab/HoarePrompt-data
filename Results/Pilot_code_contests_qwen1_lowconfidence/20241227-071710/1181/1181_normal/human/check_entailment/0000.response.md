Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach than described in the problem statement. The given solution does not correctly compute the sum of \(F(a)\) for all non-empty subsets \(a\) of the set of hacked computers. Specifically, the formula used in the program does not accurately represent the calculation of the maximum distance between pairs of computers for each subset.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible non-empty subsets and compute the maximum distance for each subset. The provided solution simplifies this problem using a different mathematical approach that does not match the requirement of iterating over all subsets and calculating the maximum distance for each subset.

Here is an outline of a correct solution:
1. Sort the coordinates of the hacked computers.
2. For each subset, calculate the maximum distance between any two points.
3. Sum up these maximum distances for all subsets and take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The given program does not follow this approach and thus does not correctly implement the solution for the problem.
