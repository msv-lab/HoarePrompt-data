Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the calculation of `F(a)` and the summation over all non-empty subsets is incorrect. The formula used in the program does not accurately represent the maximum distance between pairs of computers for each subset.

To illustrate the issue, consider the second example provided:

- Input: `3 4 3 1`
- Expected output: `9`

However, the program incorrectly calculates the result. Let's manually compute the correct result:

- Non-empty subsets of `{4, 3, 1}` are:
  - `{4}`
  - `{3}`
  - `{1}`
  - `{4, 3}`
  - `{4, 1}`
  - `{3, 1}`
  - `{4, 3, 1}`

For each subset, the maximum distance (`F(a)`) is:
- `{4}`: 0
- `{3}`: 0
- `{1}`: 0
- `{4, 3}`: 1
- `{4, 1}`: 3
- `{3, 1}`: 2
- `{4, 3, 1}`: 3

Summing these values gives `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 9`.

The program, however, does not correctly compute these values and hence fails to produce the correct output.
