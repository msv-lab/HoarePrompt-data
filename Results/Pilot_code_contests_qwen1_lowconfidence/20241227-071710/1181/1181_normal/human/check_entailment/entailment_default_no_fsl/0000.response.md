Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The formula used in the code does not match the problem description. Specifically, the code calculates the sum using a different formula compared to what is required by the problem.

The problem requires calculating the sum of \(F(a)\) for all non-empty subsets \(a\) of the set of hacked computers, where \(F(a)\) is defined as the maximum distance between any two computers in the subset \(a\). The code, however, uses a different approach involving powers of 2 and differences, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

For instance, consider the first example provided:
- Input: `2\n4 7`
- Expected output: `3`

The correct solution would calculate the sum of the maximum distances for all non-empty subsets:
- Subsets: `{4}`, `{7}`, and `{4, 7}`
- Distances: `0`, `0`, and `7 - 4 = 3`
- Sum: `0 + 0 + 3 = 3`

However, the code provided does not produce the correct result for this example. For the subset `{4, 7}`, the code would incorrectly calculate the contribution based on the given formula, leading to an incorrect total sum.

Thus, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
