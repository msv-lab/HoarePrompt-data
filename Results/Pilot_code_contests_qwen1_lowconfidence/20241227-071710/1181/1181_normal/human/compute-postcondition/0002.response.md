The code `r = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `r`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `s` is a sorted list of integers; `r` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `s` is a sorted list of integers; `r` is 0**
