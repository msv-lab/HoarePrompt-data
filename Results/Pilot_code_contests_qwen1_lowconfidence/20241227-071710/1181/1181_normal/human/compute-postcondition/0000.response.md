The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), the value of `n` remains within this range after executing the code. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value. The only change is that the input is read and assigned to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and we have read an integer from the user and assigned it to `n`.**
