The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it appears the function might be expected to read from standard input or a predefined list, given the problem constraints mentioned. The functionality involves processing a list of distinct integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 3·10^5, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9.

Given the provided output cases are not directly related to the input parameters but rather the behavior of the function, we should focus on the parameters and return value of the function itself. Since the function does not take any parameters as explicitly defined, we can only describe its expected behavior based on the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but it processes a list of distinct integers with a length between 1 and 3·10^5, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9.**
