Functionality: **The function processes a list of distinct integers of length \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \)), each integer being between 1 and \( 10^9 \). It calculates the sum of the elements in the list multiplied by a specific weighted factor, which is derived from powers of 2 and their differences. The calculation involves a loop that iterates over each element in the list, updating a running total `r` according to the formula:

\[
r \leftarrow r + s[i] \times 2^i (2^{n-2i-1} - 1) \mod (1000000000 + 7)
\]

After processing all elements, the function outputs the negation of the final value of `r`.**

The function accepts no explicit parameters, as it relies on user input for `n` and the list of integers. There are no edge cases explicitly mentioned in the annotations, but the function handles the constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq s_i \leq 10^9 \) for each integer in the list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is:

- \( n \) remains the same as the initial input.
- \( s \) remains the same as the initial input.
- \( r \) is the calculated sum as described, modulo \( 1000000000 + 7 \).

The function does not return any values; instead, it prints the negated result of `r`.
