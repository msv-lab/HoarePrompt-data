Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \).
- \( s \) is a sorted list of integers.
- \( r \) is 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(n):
    r += s[i] * (2 ** (n - 1 - i) - 1 - (2 ** i - 1)) % (1000000000 + 7)
```

### Analysis of the Loop
- The loop runs from \( i = 0 \) to \( i = n - 1 \).
- For each iteration, the value of \( r \) is updated based on the formula:
  \[
  r \leftarrow r + s[i] \times (2^{n-1-i} - 1 - (2^i - 1)) \mod (1000000000 + 7)
  \]

### Simplification of the Formula
Let's simplify the expression inside the loop:
\[
2^{n-1-i} - 1 - (2^i - 1) = 2^{n-1-i} - 2^i
\]
This can be further simplified as:
\[
2^{n-1-i} - 2^i = 2^i (2^{n-2i-1} - 1)
\]
So, the update to \( r \) becomes:
\[
r \leftarrow r + s[i] \times 2^i (2^{n-2i-1} - 1) \mod (1000000000 + 7)
\]

### Final Value of \( r \)
After all \( n \) iterations, \( r \) will be the sum of the terms:
\[
r = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \times 2^i (2^{n-2i-1} - 1) \mod (1000000000 + 7)
\]

### Final Output State
- \( n \) remains the same as the initial value.
- \( s \) remains the same as the initial value.
- \( r \) is the sum of the terms described above.

### Conclusion
The final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
\[
\text{Output State: } n \text{ is an integer such that } 1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5, \text{ } s \text{ is a sorted list of integers, } r \text{ is } \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \times 2^i (2^{n-2i-1} - 1) \mod (1000000000 + 7).
