The code `s = sorted(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each to an integer, sorts them, and assigns the sorted list to `s`. However, since `raw_input()` is not available in Python 3 (use `input()` instead), let's assume this is meant to be in Python 2. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)

The impact of the code is:
- We take a line of space-separated integers as input.
- Convert each input string to an integer.
- Sort these integers.
- Assign the sorted list to `s`.

Since the specific input is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `s`, but we know that `s` will be a sorted list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\); `s` is a sorted list of integers.**
