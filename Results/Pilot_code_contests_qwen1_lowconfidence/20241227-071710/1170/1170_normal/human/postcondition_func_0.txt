The function processes a list of books, where each book is represented by a tuple containing its thickness and width. It sorts the books in descending order based on their width, calculates the total thickness (`T`) of the books that can be placed on a shelf without exceeding the total width (`W`). The function then prints the total thickness of the selected books. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when all books cannot fit on the shelf due to their combined thickness exceeding their combined width, and the function stops adding books once this condition is met.
