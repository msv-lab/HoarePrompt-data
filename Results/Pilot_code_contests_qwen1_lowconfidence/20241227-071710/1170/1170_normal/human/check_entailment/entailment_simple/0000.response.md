Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. Let's analyze why:

1. **Sorting and Reversing Books**:
   - The program sorts and reverses the list of books based on their width (`myBooks.sort()` followed by `myBooks.reverse()`).
   - Sorting by width might not align with the requirement to minimize the total thickness of the vertical books while ensuring the width constraint is met.

2. **Summing Thickness and Width**:
   - The program sums the thickness (`T`) and subtracts the width (`W`) during the loop.
   - The logic inside the loop (`if W <= T: break`) is incorrect because it doesn't check if the current book can be placed horizontally without violating the width constraint.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Placement**:
   - The program simply accumulates the thickness (`T`) and subtracts the width (`W`) for each book, which does not guarantee the optimal solution.
   - It does not consider the actual placement of books to ensure the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that respects the constraints. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how a correct solution could be structured:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum thickness required to fit the first `i` books with a total width of `j`.
   - Iterate over each book and update the DP table based on whether the book is placed vertically or horizontally.

2. **Greedy Algorithm**:
   - Sort the books in a specific order and use a greedy strategy to place books either vertically or horizontally while maintaining the constraints.

Given these points, the current program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
