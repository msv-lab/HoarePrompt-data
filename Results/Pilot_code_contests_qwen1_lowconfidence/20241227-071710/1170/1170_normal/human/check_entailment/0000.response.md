Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total thickness of the vertical books. The logic in the program does not ensure that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 10
2 1
2 4
```

The expected output is `3`, which means the optimal arrangement is to place the book with thickness 1 vertically and the two books with thickness 2 horizontally since \(1 \geq 1 + 1\). However, the program sorts the books in descending order of width and tries to fit them into the vertical stack until the width of the horizontal books exceeds the current thickness of the vertical books. This approach does not guarantee the optimal solution.

In this specific example, the program will incorrectly place the book with width 10 vertically, resulting in a total thickness of 10, which is not the minimum possible thickness.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
