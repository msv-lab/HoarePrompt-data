Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the total width of the horizontal books exceeds the total thickness of the vertical books. Let's consider the second example provided:

**Input:**
```
3
1 10
2 1
2 4
```

According to the problem description, the sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. However, the program does not check this condition properly. Here's what happens with the given input:

- The books are sorted in descending order of width: [(10, 1), (4, 2), (1, 2)].
- The program adds the books one by one, updating the total thickness `T` and the remaining width `W`.

When the program processes the books, it adds the first book (width 10, thickness 1) vertically, making `T = 1`. Then it adds the second book (width 4, thickness 2) horizontally, which makes `W = 6` and `T = 3`. Finally, it adds the third book (width 1, thickness 2) vertically, making `T = 5`.

However, the total width of the horizontal books (10 + 4) is 14, which is greater than the total thickness of the vertical books (5). This violates the condition specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not produce the correct output for this case.

A correct solution would include a check to ensure that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books after each book is added.
