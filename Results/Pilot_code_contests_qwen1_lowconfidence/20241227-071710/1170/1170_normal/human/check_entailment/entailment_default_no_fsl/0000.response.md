Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the code assumes that sorting the books in descending order of width and then selecting books until the width constraint is met will yield the minimum total thickness of the vertical books. However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2 10
1 5
2 4
```

The expected output should be 3 because the optimal arrangement is to place the first and third books vertically (total thickness = 4) and the second book horizontally (width = 5, which is within the thickness limit of 4), resulting in a total thickness of 3 for the vertical books.

However, the current code will sort the books as follows:
- [10, 2]
- [5, 1]
- [4, 2]

It will then add the first book (thickness = 2) and the second book (thickness = 1), resulting in a total thickness of 3. But it will not check if a better arrangement exists.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated algorithm is needed, such as a dynamic programming approach or a backtracking method to explore all possible combinations and find the one with the minimum total thickness that satisfies the constraints.
