Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the total width of the horizontal books exceeds the total thickness of the vertical books. Specifically, the code sorts the books in descending order based on their width and adds them to the vertical stack until the sum of the widths of the horizontal books exceeds the total thickness of the vertical books. However, the problem description requires that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. The current implementation does not check if the remaining width of the horizontal books can be accommodated within the remaining thickness of the vertical books, which can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2 10
1 5
1 5
```

The correct output should be 3, because the first book can be placed vertically (thickness 2), and the other two books can be placed horizontally (width 5 + 5 = 10, which is less than or equal to the thickness 2 of the first book). However, the current implementation would incorrectly place the first book horizontally, leading to a total thickness of 10, which is incorrect.
