You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Shaass has n books. He wants to make a bookshelf for all his books. He wants the bookshelf's dimensions to be as small as possible. The thickness of the i-th book is ti and its pages' width is equal to wi. The thickness of each book is either 1 or 2. All books have the same page heights.

<image>

Shaass puts the books on the bookshelf in the following way. First he selects some of the books and put them vertically. Then he puts the rest of the books horizontally above the vertical books. The sum of the widths of the horizontal books must be no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. A sample arrangement of the books is depicted in the figure.

<image>

Help Shaass to find the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines contains two integers ti and wi denoting the thickness and width of the i-th book correspondingly, (1 ≤ ti ≤ 2, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100).

Output

On the only line of the output print the minimum total thickness of the vertical books that we can achieve.

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    myBooks = []
    W = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        (t, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        W += w
        myBooks.append([w, t])
    myBooks.sort()
    myBooks.reverse()
    T = 0
    for book in myBooks:
        T += book[1]
        W -= book[0]
        if W <= T:
            break
    print(T)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total thickness of the vertical books. The logic in the program does not ensure that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 10
2 1
2 4
```

The expected output is `3`, which means the optimal arrangement is to place the book with thickness 1 vertically and the two books with thickness 2 horizontally since \(1 \geq 1 + 1\). However, the program sorts the books in descending order of width and tries to fit them into the vertical stack until the width of the horizontal books exceeds the current thickness of the vertical books. This approach does not guarantee the optimal solution.

In this specific example, the program will incorrectly place the book with width 10 vertically, resulting in a total thickness of 10, which is not the minimum possible thickness.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a list of books, where each book is represented by a tuple containing its thickness and width. It sorts the books in descending order based on their width, calculates the total thickness (`T`) of the books that can be placed on a shelf without exceeding the total width (`W`). The function then prints the total thickness of the selected books. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when all books cannot fit on the shelf due to their combined thickness exceeding their combined width, and the function stops adding books once this condition is met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
