Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of books.
   - For each book, it reads two integers `ti` and `wi`, where `ti` is the thickness and `wi` is the width of the book.
   - The input handling matches the problem description and constraints.

2. **Data Structure and Sorting**:
   - The program stores the books in a list `myBooks` where each element is a list containing the width and thickness of a book.
   - The books are sorted in descending order based on their width using `myBooks.sort()` followed by `myBooks.reverse()`.
   - This sorting ensures that the widest books are considered first, which helps in minimizing the total thickness of the vertical books.

3. **Logic to Calculate Minimum Thickness**:
   - The program initializes `T` (total thickness) and `W` (total width).
   - It iterates through the sorted books and adds the thickness of each book to `T` while subtracting the width from `W`.
   - The loop breaks as soon as `W` becomes less than or equal to `T`. At this point, `T` represents the minimum total thickness of the vertical books.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `T`, which is the result as per the problem description.

Given the steps and logic explained above, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the necessary aspects required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
