The code initializes the variable `T` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `W`, or `myBooks`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `T`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `i` is equal to `n`; `W` is the sum of all integers `w` entered; `myBooks` is a list containing pairs `[w, t]` sorted in descending order based on the integer `w`; `T` is 0.**
