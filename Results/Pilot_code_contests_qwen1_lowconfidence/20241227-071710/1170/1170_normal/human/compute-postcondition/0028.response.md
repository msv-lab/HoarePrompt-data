The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `myBooks`, `T`, and `W`. It only breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given initial state, the `break` statement will simply cause the program to exit the context where it was used (not specified in the initial state).

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:

Output State: **`myBooks` has at least one element, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the current book, and `W` is decreased by the first element of the current book.**
