According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer from input, `w` is twice the integer from input, `myBooks` contains the element `[2 * t, t]`**
