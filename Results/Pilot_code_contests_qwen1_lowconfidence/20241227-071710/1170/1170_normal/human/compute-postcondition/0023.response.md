The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. Given the conditions in the initial state, the only variables affected are `T` and `W`, but the `break` statement does not further modify their values. The output state remains as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`myBooks` has at least one element, `T` is the original value of `T` plus `book[1]`, `W` is decreased by `book[0]`, the current value of `W` is less than or equal to the current value of `T`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
