To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its behavior step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `W` is the sum of all integers `w` entered.
   - `myBooks` is a list containing pairs `[w, t]` sorted in descending order based on the integer `w`.
   - `T` is 0.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each pair `[w, t]` in `myBooks`.
   - For each iteration:
     - `T` is incremented by `book[1]` (i.e., `t`).
     - `W` is decremented by `book[0]` (i.e., `w`).
     - If `W` becomes less than or equal to `T`, the loop breaks.

### Loop Execution

- **After the first iteration**: 
  - `T` is updated to `T + book[1]`.
  - `W` is updated to `W - book[0]`.
  - The loop may or may not break depending on the condition `W <= T`.

- **After the second iteration**:
  - `T` is further updated to `T + book[1]` where `book` is the second entry in `myBooks`.
  - `W` is further updated to `W - book[0]` where `book` is the first entry in `myBooks`.
  - Again, the loop may or may not break depending on the condition `W <= T`.

- **General Iteration**:
  - After `k` iterations, `T` is updated to `T + book[1]` where `book` is the `k`th entry in `myBooks`.
  - `W` is updated to `W - book[0]` where `book` is the `(k-1)`th entry in `myBooks`.
  - The loop may break at any point if `W <= T` is satisfied.

### Final Output State

- **Final Values**:
  - `T` is the sum of all `t` values from the entries in `myBooks` up to the point where the loop breaks.
  - `W` is the sum of all `w` values from the entries in `myBooks` up to the point just before the loop breaks.
  - `myBooks` remains unchanged from its initial state unless the loop breaks, in which case it is truncated.

- **Condition for Breaking**:
  - The loop breaks when `W` becomes less than or equal to `T`.

### Conclusion

The final state of the loop after all iterations would be:

Output State: **`T` is the sum of all `t` values from the entries in `myBooks` up to the point where the loop breaks, `W` is the sum of all `w` values from the entries in `myBooks` up to the point just before the loop breaks, and `myBooks` remains unchanged from its initial state unless the loop breaks, in which case it is truncated.**

This can be simplified to:

Output State: **`T` is the sum of `t` values from the remaining books in `myBooks`, `W` is the sum of `w` values from the remaining books in `myBooks`, and `myBooks` remains unchanged or truncated based on the loop condition.**
