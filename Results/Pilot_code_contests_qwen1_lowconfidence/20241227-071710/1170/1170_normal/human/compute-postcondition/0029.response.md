Postcondition: ***`myBooks` has at least one element, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the current book, and `W` is decreased by the first element of the current book. This holds true regardless of whether `W <= T` is satisfied or not since there is no else part provided and the condition does not change the overall state outside of the if condition.***
