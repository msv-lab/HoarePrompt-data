The code `myBooks.reverse()` reverses the list `myBooks` in-place. This means the list `myBooks` will be reversed, but the values of `n`, `i`, `W`, and `myBooks` will be updated accordingly.

- `n` remains unchanged, so it is still an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `i` remains unchanged, so it is still equal to `n`.
- `W` remains unchanged, so it is still the sum of all integers `w` entered.
- `myBooks` is reversed in-place, so it is now a list containing pairs `[w, t]` sorted in descending order based on the integer `w`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\); `i` is equal to `n`; `W` is the sum of all integers `w` entered; `myBooks` is a list containing pairs `[w, t]` sorted in descending order based on the integer `w`.**
