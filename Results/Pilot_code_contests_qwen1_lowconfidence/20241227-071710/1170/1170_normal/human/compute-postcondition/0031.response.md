`T` is incremented by the second element of the `book` list, and `W` is not affected by this operation. The initial state is that `myBooks` has at least one element, and `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the next book. After executing the code, `T` will be updated accordingly, while `W` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `myBooks` has at least one element, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the next book, and `W` is decreased by the first element of the next book.

Output State: **`myBooks` has at least one element, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the next book, and `W` is decreased by the first element of the next book.**
