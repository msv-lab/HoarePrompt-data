The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to operate on data that is presumably provided elsewhere in the program or through some external means (not shown in the snippet). The functionality of the function is to process a list of books, where each book is represented by a tuple containing its thickness (`ti`) and width (`wi`). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given snippet.
