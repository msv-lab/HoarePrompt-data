According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the initialization of the loop variable `i`.

- The loop `for i in range(0, n):` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
- Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0.
- Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `n` being 0 would prevent the loop from executing.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
