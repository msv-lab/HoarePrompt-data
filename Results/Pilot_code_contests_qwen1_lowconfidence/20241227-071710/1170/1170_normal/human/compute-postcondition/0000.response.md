`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which reads an integer from the input and converts it to an integer. This value is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The other variables (`ti` and `wi`) are not yet defined, so they remain in their initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100**
