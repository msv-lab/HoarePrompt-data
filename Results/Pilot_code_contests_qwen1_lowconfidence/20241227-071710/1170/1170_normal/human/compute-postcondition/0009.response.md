`W` is incremented by `w`. The value of `w` is the second input integer, so `W` becomes the sum of the first input integer and the second input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` is the first input integer, `w` is the second input integer, `myBooks` contains the element `[2 * t, t]`, and `W` is the sum of the first and second input integers.
