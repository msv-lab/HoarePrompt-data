The code `T += book[1]` increments the value of `T` by the value of `book[1]`. Given the initial state that `myBooks` must have at least one element, but no information about `T` or `book` other than `book[1]` being an element of `myBooks`, we can deduce that `T` is incremented by the second element (index 1) of the list `book`. However, since `T` is not initially defined in the given information, we assume it is initialized to 0 or some other value that gets updated by this operation.

Since the exact initial value of `T` is not specified, we can say that `T` is now the original value of `T` plus `book[1]`.

Output State: **`myBooks` must have at least one element; `T` is the original value of `T` plus `book[1]`**
