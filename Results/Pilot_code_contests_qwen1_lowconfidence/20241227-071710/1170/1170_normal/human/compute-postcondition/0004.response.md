`t` and `w` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user, and `split()` splits this line into two parts, which are then converted to integers by `map(int,)`. The previous value of `i` is unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains valid. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer from input, `w` is an integer from input**
