The code `break` does not affect the value of `myBooks` or `W`. It simply breaks out of the loop or if statement it is inside. Since the initial state specifies that `myBooks` has at least one element and `W` is decreased by the first element of the next book (which is implied but not directly modified in this code), the only thing that happens is breaking out of the loop or if statement.

Output State: **`myBooks` has at least one element, `W` is decreased by the first element of the next book and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
