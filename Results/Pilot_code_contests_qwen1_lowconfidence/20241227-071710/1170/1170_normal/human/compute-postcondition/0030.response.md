According to the code, the loop iterates over each book in `myBooks`. The loop body is omitted, but based on the given information, we know the following:

- `myBooks` has at least one element.
- `T` is updated to include the original value of `T` plus the second element of the current book.
- `W` is decreased by the first element of the current book.

Since the loop body does not specify any additional conditions or changes to the state beyond these updates, we can deduce the following for the next iteration:

1. The loop will continue as long as `myBooks` has at least one remaining element.
2. The state will be adjusted based on the next book in `myBooks`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `myBooks` has at least one element.
   - `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the current book.
   - `W` is decreased by the first element of the current book.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `myBooks` had at least one element, there is at least one more book to process.
   - The loop will take the next book from `myBooks`.
   - `T` will be updated to include the original value of `T` plus the second element of the next book.
   - `W` will be decreased by the first element of the next book.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`myBooks` has at least one element, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the next book, and `W` is decreased by the first element of the next book.**
