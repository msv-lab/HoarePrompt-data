To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial states step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `W` is the sum of all integers `w` entered.
   - `myBooks` is a list containing pairs `[w, t]` sorted in descending order based on the integer `w`.
   - `T` is 0.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for book in myBooks:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The `for` loop iterates over each element in the `myBooks` list.
   - For the loop to execute, `myBooks` must contain at least one element.

4. **Current State Consideration:**
   - Since `myBooks` is a list of pairs `[w, t]`, it must have at least one pair to enter the loop.
   - `myBooks` being empty would mean the loop does not execute.

5. **Necessary Adjustments:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to guarantee that `myBooks` contains at least one element.
   - We don't need to adjust the values of `n`, `i`, `W`, or `T` as they do not directly influence the condition for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `myBooks` contains at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`myBooks` must have at least one element**
