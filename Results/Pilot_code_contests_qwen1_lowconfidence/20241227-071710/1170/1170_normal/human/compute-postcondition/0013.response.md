The value of `W` is incremented by `w`. Initially, `W` is the sum of the first and second input integers. Since `w` is one of the input integers, let's denote the first input integer as `t` and the second input integer as `w`. So, initially, `W = t + w`.

After executing the line `W += w`, the new value of `W` will be `t + w + w`, which simplifies to `t + 2w`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 2, `i` is 2, `t` is the first input integer, `w` is the second input integer, `myBooks` contains the elements `[[2 * t, t], [w, t]]`, `W` is `t + 2w`.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `i` is 2, `t` is the first input integer, `w` is the second input integer, `myBooks` contains the elements `[[2 * t, t], [w, t]]`, `W` is `t + 2w`**
