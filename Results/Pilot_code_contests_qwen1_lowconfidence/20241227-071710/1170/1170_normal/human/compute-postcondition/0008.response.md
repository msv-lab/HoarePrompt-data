The initial state is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer from input, `w` is twice the integer from input, `myBooks` contains the element `[2 * t, t]`.

The code snippet is:
```
t, w = map(int, raw_input().split())
```

This code takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `t` and `w` respectively. The original values of `t` and `w` are replaced by these new values.

- The original `t` (an integer from input) is now replaced by the first input.
- The original `w` (twice the integer from input) is now replaced by the second input.

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The list `myBooks` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` is the first input integer, `w` is the second input integer, `myBooks` contains the element `[2 * t, t]`**
