The code `myBooks.sort()` sorts the list `myBooks` in place, which means the list `myBooks` is modified. However, no new variables are created, and the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `W` also remains unchanged since sorting does not affect the sum of integers `w`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `i` is equal to `n`, `W` is the sum of all integers `w` entered, `myBooks` is a list containing pairs `[w, t]` sorted in ascending order based on the integer `w`.**
