`w` is incremented by the value of `w`. The previous value of `w` is an integer from input, so the new value of `w` is its original value plus itself, which is twice its original value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer from input, `w` is twice the integer from input**
