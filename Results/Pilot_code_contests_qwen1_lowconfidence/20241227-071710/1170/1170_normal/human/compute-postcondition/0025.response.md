According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `myBooks`. The loop will continue as long as `myBooks` has at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `myBooks` had at least one element, `T` was updated to the original value of `T` plus `book[1]`, and `W` was decreased by `book[0]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `myBooks` must still have at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`myBooks` has at least one element, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the current book, and `W` is decreased by the first element of the current book**.
