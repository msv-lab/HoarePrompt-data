The code `myBooks.append([w, t])` appends the list `[w, t]` to the list `myBooks`. Given the initial state, `myBooks` contains `[[2 * t, t], [w, t]]`. Since `w` and `t` are input integers, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, after appending `[w, t]`, `myBooks` will contain `[[2 * t, t], [w, t], [w, t]]`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `W`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `i` is 2, `t` is the first input integer, `w` is the second input integer, `myBooks` contains the elements `[[2 * t, t], [w, t], [w, t]], `W` is `t + 2w`**
