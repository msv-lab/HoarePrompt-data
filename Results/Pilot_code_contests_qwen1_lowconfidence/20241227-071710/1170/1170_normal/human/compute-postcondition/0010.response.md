`myBooks.append([w, t])` appends a new list `[w, t]` to the existing list `myBooks`. Initially, `myBooks` contains `[2 * t, t]`. Since `w` is the sum of the first and second input integers, the new list appended will be `[w, t]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `w`, and `W` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated `myBooks` list is `[[2 * t, t], [w, t]]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` is the first input integer, `w` is the second input integer, `myBooks` contains the elements `[[2 * t, t], [w, t]]`, `W` is the sum of the first and second input integers.**
