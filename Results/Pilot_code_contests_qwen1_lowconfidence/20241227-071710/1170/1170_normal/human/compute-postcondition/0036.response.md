The code `print(T)` simply prints the value of `T`. Since `T` is the sum of `t` values from the remaining books in `myBooks`, the printing of `T` does not change its value. The `myBooks` list remains unchanged, and the value of `W` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is the sum of `t` values from the remaining books in `myBooks`, `W` is the sum of `w` values from the remaining books in `myBooks`, and `myBooks` remains unchanged.**
