The code appends a list `[w, t]` to the `myBooks` list. Given the initial state, `w` is `2 * t`, and `t` is an integer input. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code.

After the execution, the `myBooks` list will have the new element `[w, t]`. Since `t` is the integer input and `w` is `2 * t`, the new element in `myBooks` will be `[2 * t, t]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer from input, `w` is twice the integer from input, `myBooks` contains the element `[2 * t, t]`**
