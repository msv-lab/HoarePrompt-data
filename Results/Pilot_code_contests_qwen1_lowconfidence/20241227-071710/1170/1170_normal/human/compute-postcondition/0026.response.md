The code snippet `T += book[1]` impacts the variable `T` by adding the second element of the current book to its value. The first element of the current book is subtracted from `W`, but since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the elements in `book`, we will use the general form.

From the initial state, we know:
- `myBooks` has at least one element.
- `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the current book.
- `W` is decreased by the first element of the current book.

After executing the code:
- The new value of `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the current book.
- The new value of `W` is the original value of `W` minus the first element of the current book.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`myBooks` has at least one element, `T` is the original value of `T` plus the second element of the current book, and `W` is decreased by the first element of the current book.**
