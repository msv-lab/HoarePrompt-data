The code `t, w = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them, converting them to integers, and assigns them to `t` and `w` respectively. Since `raw_input()` expects input in the form of space-separated values, let's denote the input as `a b`. After reading the input, `t` will be set to `a` and `w` will be set to `b`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `n` is 2, `i` is 2, `t` is the first input integer, `w` is the second input integer, `myBooks` contains the elements `[[2 * t, t], [w, t]]`, `W` is the sum of the first and second input integers.

2. After executing the code `t, w = map(int, raw_input().split())`:
   - `t` and `w` are updated with the respective values from the input.
   - `myBooks` is updated based on the new values of `t` and `w`.
   - `W` is recalculated based on the new values of `t` and `w`.

Given the initial state, the specific values of `t` and `w` are now the first and second input integers, respectively. Therefore, `myBooks` will be `[[2 * t, t], [w, t]]` and `W` will be `t + w`.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `i` is 2, `t` is the first input integer, `w` is the second input integer, `myBooks` contains the elements `[[2 * t, t], [w, t]]`, `W` is the sum of the first and second input integers**.
