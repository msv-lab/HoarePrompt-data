The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `p` (a prime number greater than `n`), and returns the result of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \). This computation is performed using the `pow` function, which efficiently calculates the modular exponentiation. The function ensures that the input `p` is indeed a prime number greater than `n`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, as the `pow` function inherently handles the modulo operation correctly. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program returns the computed value \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \).
