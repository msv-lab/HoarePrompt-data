#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, p is a prime number greater than n.
def func_1(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer and \( p \) is a prime number greater than \( n \)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `p` (a prime number greater than `n`), and returns the result of \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \). This computation is performed using the `pow` function, which efficiently calculates the modular exponentiation. The function ensures that the input `p` is indeed a prime number greater than `n`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, as the `pow` function inherently handles the modulo operation correctly. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program returns the computed value \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct information about the variables in the function signature since `func_4` is called without any arguments. However, based on the context provided in the problem description, we can infer that `func_4()` returns input data necessary for solving the problem, and `func_2()` processes this data to compute the minimum possible value of `max(b_i, c_i)` both initially and after each change.
def func_2():
    return map(int, func_4().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers split from the string returned by `func_4()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing integers split from the string returned by `func_4()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns this map object, which contains integer values derived from splitting a string obtained from `func_4()`. No further processing or changes are made to these integers within `func_2`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `func_4()` returns an empty string, resulting in an empty map being returned by `func_2`. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code; however, the function does not perform any additional operations on the integers once they are split and mapped.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables or their relationships are provided within the given function signature or problem description. The function `func_3()` does not take any parameters and its purpose seems to be reading space-separated integers from a string returned by `func_4()`. However, without the definition of `func_4()`, we cannot provide a complete precondition.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_4().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_4()` and converting each element to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by calling `func_4()`, which presumably returns a string containing space-separated integers. `func_3()` then splits this string into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns the resulting list. Potential edge cases include situations where `func_4()` returns an empty string, leading to an empty list being returned, or where `func_4()` returns a string with no spaces, in which case `split()` would return a single-element list containing the entire string. The function also assumes that `func_4()` returns a string consisting only of valid integers separated by spaces; any other input would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert the string elements to integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables (n, a, q, l, r, x) are defined within the function, indicating that these variables should be provided as inputs or defined outside the function scope.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes no parameters and simply prompts the user for input and returns that input. There are no variables defined within the function, implying that it relies on user input to produce its output. There are no postconditions beyond returning the user's input, and no edge cases or additional functionality are present in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is an integer n representing the length of the sequence, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the initial sequence. Then, an integer q is provided, followed by q lines, each containing three integers l, r, and x describing the changes to be applied to the sequence.
def func_5():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user, which represents the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself and another integer q indicating the number of changes to be applied to the sequence
#Overall this is what the function does:The function prompts the user to input an integer `n` representing the length of the sequence, followed by `n` integers representing the initial sequence. Then, it takes an integer `q` indicating the number of changes to be applied to the sequence. Finally, it processes `q` lines, each containing three integers `l`, `r`, and `x` that describe the changes to the sequence (e.g., changing elements from index `l` to `r` by adding `x` to each element). The function returns an integer input by the user, which represents the length of the sequence, the sequence itself, and the number of changes `q`. However, the function does not actually process or apply the changes to the sequence; it only reads the inputs and returns them.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
def func_6(x, y):
    x = abs(x)
    y = abs(y)
    if (min(x, y) == 0) :
        return max(x, y)
        #The program returns the maximum value between x (which is the absolute value of its original value) and y (which is the absolute value of its original value)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is the absolute value of its original value, `y` is the absolute value of its original value, and neither `x` nor `y` is 0
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is 0, `y` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:-

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_7(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n // i == i:
                l.append(i)
            else:
                l.append(i)
                l.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    return l
    #The program returns list 'l'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list `l` containing all unique divisors of `n`. Specifically, the function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, checking if they are divisors of `n`. If a number `i` is a divisor, both `i` and `n // i` are added to the list `l`. This ensures that each divisor pair is included only once, even for perfect squares. The function handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by including the square root only once. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs; such inputs would raise a `TypeError` when attempting to compute `math.sqrt(n)` or cause undefined behavior.
