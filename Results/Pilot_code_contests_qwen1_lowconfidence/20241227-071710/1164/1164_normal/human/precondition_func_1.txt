There is no direct information about the variables in the function signature since `func_4` is called without any arguments. However, based on the context provided in the problem description, we can infer that `func_4()` returns input data necessary for solving the problem, and `func_2()` processes this data to compute the minimum possible value of `max(b_i, c_i)` both initially and after each change.
