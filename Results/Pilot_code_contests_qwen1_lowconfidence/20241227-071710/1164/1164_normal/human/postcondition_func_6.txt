The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list `l` containing all unique divisors of `n`. Specifically, the function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, checking if they are divisors of `n`. If a number `i` is a divisor, both `i` and `n // i` are added to the list `l`. This ensures that each divisor pair is included only once, even for perfect squares. The function handles the case where `n` is a perfect square by including the square root only once. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs; such inputs would raise a `TypeError` when attempting to compute `math.sqrt(n)` or cause undefined behavior.
