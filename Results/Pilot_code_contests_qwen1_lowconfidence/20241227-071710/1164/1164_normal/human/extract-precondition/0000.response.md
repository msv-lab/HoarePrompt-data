The provided function `func_8` does not seem to relate to the problem description given. The function is meant to find all prime numbers up to `n`, but it does not interact with the sequences `b` and `c` or the input/output requirements specified in the problem. Therefore, I cannot extract a relevant precondition based on the given function. 

However, based on the problem description, we can extract the precondition for the main problem as follows:

```plaintext
Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9, and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5.**
```

If you need help with a different function or more context around the problem, please provide additional details or correct the function.
