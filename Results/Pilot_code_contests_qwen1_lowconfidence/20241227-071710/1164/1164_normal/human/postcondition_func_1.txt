The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a map object containing integers split from the string returned by `func_4()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns this map object, which contains integer values derived from splitting a string obtained from `func_4()`. No further processing or changes are made to these integers within `func_2`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `func_4()` returns an empty string, resulting in an empty map being returned by `func_2`. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code; however, the function does not perform any additional operations on the integers once they are split and mapped.
