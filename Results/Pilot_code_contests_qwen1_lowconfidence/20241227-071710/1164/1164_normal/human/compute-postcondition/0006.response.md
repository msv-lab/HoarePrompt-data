The code snippet `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` does not exist, so it is created as an empty list. The value of `i` is a divisor of `n`, and `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer. The quotient of `n // i` is not equal to `i`.

After executing the code, `i` remains a divisor of `n`, and the quotient of `n // i` is still not equal to `i`. The only change is that `i` is appended to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is a divisor of `n`, the quotient of `n // i` is not equal to `i`; `l` is an empty list containing `i`**
