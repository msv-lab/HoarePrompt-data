Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( \text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1 \) is a positive integer.
- \( i = \text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) \).
- \( l \) is a list.

### Loop Condition
The loop iterates over the range from 1 to \( \text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) \).

### Current Iteration
- The loop starts with \( i = \text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) \).
- The loop condition checks if \( n \) divided by \( i \) equals \( i \). If it does, \( l \) gets updated to include the elements based on the current value of \( i \) plus the new element \( i \). Otherwise, \( l \) is set to \( [i, n // i] \).

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- We need to determine the new values for \( i \) and the updated state of \( l \) for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the new value of \( i \):**
   - The loop increments \( i \) by 1 each time.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) was \( \text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) \).
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, \( i \) will be \( \text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) + 1 \).

2. **Update the state of \( l \):**
   - For the next iteration, we need to check the condition \( n \) divided by the new \( i \).
   - If \( n // (\text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) + 1) == \text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) + 1 \), then \( l \) will be updated accordingly.
   - Otherwise, \( l \) will be set to \( [\text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) + 1, n // (\text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) + 1)] \).

### Final State
- \( i \) will be \( \text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) + 1 \).
- \( l \) will be updated based on the condition \( n // (\text{int}(\text{math.sqrt}(n) + 1) + 1) \).

### Adjusted State
- The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of \( i \) and the updated state of \( l \).

### Conclusion
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`, and `l` is a list. If `n // (int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1) == int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`, then `l` contains the elements based on the current value of `i` plus the new element `i`. Otherwise, `l` contains `[i, n // (int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1)]`.**
