Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`.
   - `l` is a list containing `i` twice.

2. Code to be executed:
   ```python
   l.append(n // i)
   ```

3. Impact Analysis:
   - The value of `i` is determined from `math.sqrt(n) + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is also a positive integer, `i` will be one more than the integer part of `math.sqrt(n) + 1`.
   - `l.append(n // i)` appends the integer division of `n` by `i` to the list `l`.

4. Calculation:
   - Let’s denote `k = math.sqrt(n) + 1`. Since `k` is an integer, `i = int(k) + 1`.
   - `n // i` will be the integer division of `n` by `i`.

5. Specific Values:
   - Since `n` is such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is an integer, let’s assume `math.sqrt(n) + 1 = k`, where `k` is an integer.
   - Thus, `i = k + 1`.
   - `n // i` will be `n // (k + 1)`.

6. Updated State:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `l` now contains `i` twice and additionally has `n // i` appended to it.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer; `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`; `l` is a list containing `i` twice and additionally has `n // i` appended to it.**
