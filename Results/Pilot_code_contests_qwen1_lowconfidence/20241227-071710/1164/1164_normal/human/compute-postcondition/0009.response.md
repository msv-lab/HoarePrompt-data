Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer. If `n` has a divisor `i` where `n // i` equals `i`, then `l` contains the value `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing `[i, n // i]`. Since there is no else part, these are the only possible outcomes.***
