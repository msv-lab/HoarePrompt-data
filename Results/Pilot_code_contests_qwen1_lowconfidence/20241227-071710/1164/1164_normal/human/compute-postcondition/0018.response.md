First, let's analyze the initial state and the given conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer.
- `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`.
- `l` is a list.

From the condition `n // (int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1) == int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`, we know that `n` is a perfect square. This means that `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)` is an integer, and when we add 1 to it, we get `i`. Since `n` is a perfect square, `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1` will divide `n` evenly, making the condition true. Thus, `l` will contain the elements based on the current value of `i` plus the new element `i`.

The code snippet `l.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `l`.

Given this, let's proceed step-by-step:

1. Calculate `i`: 
   \[
   i = \text{int}(\sqrt{n} + 1) + 1
   \]
2. Check the condition `n // i == i`:
   - Since `n` is a perfect square and `i` is derived from the square root, this condition is true.
3. Append `i` to `l`:
   - `l` now contains `i` plus the new element `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`, `l` is a list containing `i` twice.**
