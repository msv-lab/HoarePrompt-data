The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is a divisor of `n` and `n // i` equals `i`, it means `n = i * i`, which implies `n` is a perfect square. The value of `i` is added to the list `l`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is a divisor of `n`, `n // i` equals `i`; `l` contains the value `i`.**
