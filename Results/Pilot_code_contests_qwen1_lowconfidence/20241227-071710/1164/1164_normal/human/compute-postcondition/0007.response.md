`l` is appended with the value of `n // i`. Since `i` is a divisor of `n`, `n // i` is another divisor of `n`. Given the initial state, `l` is an empty list containing `i`, so after appending `n // i`, `l` now contains both `i` and `n // i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is a divisor of `n`, the quotient of `n // i` is not equal to `i`; `l` is a list containing `[i, n // i]`**
