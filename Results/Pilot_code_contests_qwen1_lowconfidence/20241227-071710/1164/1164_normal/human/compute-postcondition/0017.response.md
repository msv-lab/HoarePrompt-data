Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`.
- `l` is a list.

If `n // (int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1) == int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`, then `l` contains the elements based on the current value of `i` plus the new element `i`. Otherwise, `l` contains `[i, n // (int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1)]`.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
l.append(i)
```

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Check the condition in the initial state:**
   - `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`.
   - We need to determine whether `n // i == i`.

2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - Since `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, letâ€™s denote it as `k`.
   - Thus, `i = k + 1`.
   - And `n = k^2` because `n` must satisfy the condition that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is an integer.

3. **Evaluate the condition:**
   - `n // i == k + 1`.
   - Substituting `n = k^2` and `i = k + 1`, we get `k^2 // (k + 1) == k + 1`.
   - This simplifies to `k^2 / (k + 1)` being an integer which equals `k + 1`.

4. **Since `k^2 / (k + 1) == k + 1` is true, the condition is met.**
   - Therefore, `l` should contain the elements based on the current value of `i` plus the new element `i`.

5. **Appending `i` to `l`:**
   - `l` will now contain all the elements it previously had, plus the new element `i`.

Given this, the output state will be:
- `i` remains the same as `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`.
- `l` is updated to include the new element `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) + 1`, and `l` is a list containing its previous elements plus the new element `i`.**
