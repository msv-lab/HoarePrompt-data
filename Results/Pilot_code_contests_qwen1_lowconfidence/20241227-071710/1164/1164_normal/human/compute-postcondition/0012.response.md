`l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, and `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is also a positive integer. The list `l` did not exist in the initial state, so it is initialized with `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, and `l` is a list containing `[i]`.**
