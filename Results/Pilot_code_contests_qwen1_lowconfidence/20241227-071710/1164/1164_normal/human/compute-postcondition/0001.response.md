Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 up to (but not including) `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer and the expression `math.sqrt(n) + 1` must be a positive number that results in an integer value for the loop's range.

2. **Initial State**: We are given that `n` is a positive integer and `l` is an empty list. This means `n > 0`.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute, `math.sqrt(n) + 1` must result in an integer value that is greater than 0. Since `n` is a positive integer, `math.sqrt(n)` is also a non-negative number. Adding 1 ensures that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is always greater than 1.
   - Therefore, the key requirement is that `n` must be such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `l` is not used in the loop condition and its state doesn't affect the loop's execution, we don't need to adjust anything related to `l`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer and that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` results in a positive integer value that allows the loop to run.

Based on the above analysis, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer**
