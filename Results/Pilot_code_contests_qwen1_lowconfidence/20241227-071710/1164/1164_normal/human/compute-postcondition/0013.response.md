`l.append(n // i)` appends the value of `n // i` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, we know that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, which means `i = int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, `n // i` will be an integer.

Let's denote `k = math.sqrt(n) + 1`. Therefore, `i = k` and `n = (k - 1) * k` because `k` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `math.sqrt(n)`, making `n` a perfect square or a number just below a perfect square when divided by `k` gives us `(k-1)`.

So, `n // i = (k - 1)`. Initially, `l` contains `[i]`, and now it will contain `[i, n // i]`.

Given this, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, and `l` is a list containing `[i, n // i]`.**
