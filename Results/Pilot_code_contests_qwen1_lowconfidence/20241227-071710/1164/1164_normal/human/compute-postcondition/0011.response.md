`l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, and given that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is also a positive integer. The initial state includes `n` being a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` being `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, and `l` being updated based on the current value of `i`. After executing `l.append(i)`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, but `l` now contains an additional element `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer; `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`; `l` is a list containing the elements based on the current value of `i` plus the new element `i`.**
