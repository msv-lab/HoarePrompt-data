To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - The variable `n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer. This implies that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is an integer, meaning `math.sqrt(n)` is just below an integer.
   - The list `l` is constructed based on the divisors of `n`. Specifically, if `n` has a divisor `i` where `n // i` equals `i`, then `l` contains the value `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing `[i, n // i]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
   - For each `i` in this range, the loop checks if `i` is a divisor of `n` and updates the list `l` accordingly.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the highest value it had before, which is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1) - 1`.
   - The loop will continue to the next iteration if `i < int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.

4. **Updated States:**
   - Since `i` will be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, and the loop will check if this new `i` is a divisor of `n`.
   - The state of `n` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `i` and `l` based on the current value of `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `math.sqrt(n) + 1` is a positive integer, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`, and `l` is updated based on the current value of `i`.**
