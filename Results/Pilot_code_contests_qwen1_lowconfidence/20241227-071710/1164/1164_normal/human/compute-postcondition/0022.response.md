Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `l` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
    if n % i == 0:
        if n // i == i:
            l.append(i)
        else:
            l.append(i)
            l.append(n // i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)`.
   - For each `i`, if `n % i == 0` (i.e., `i` is a divisor of `n`), then:
     - If `n // i == i` (i.e., `i` is a perfect square root of `n`), append `i` to `l`.
     - Otherwise, append both `i` and `n // i` to `l`.

2. **Understanding the Final List `l`**:
   - The list `l` will contain all unique divisors of `n` that satisfy the condition described above.
   - Each pair of divisors `(i, n // i)` where `i != n // i` will appear in the list exactly once.
   - If `n` is a perfect square (i.e., `n` is a square of an integer), the corresponding divisor will appear only once in the list.

3. **Final Values of Variables**:
   - If the loop executes at least once, `l` will contain all unique divisors of `n` derived from the conditions mentioned.
   - If `n` is a perfect square, the square root will be listed only once.
   - If `n` is a prime number, `l` will only contain `1` and `n`.

4. **Case When the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `n` is less than 1 (which contradicts the initial state of `n` being a positive integer), the loop does not execute, and `l` remains empty.

### Output State After All Iterations of the Loop Have Finished:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `l` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` derived from the conditions specified in the loop. If `n` is a perfect square, the square root is listed only once. If `n` is a prime number, `l` will only contain `1` and `n`.

**Output State:**
**`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list containing all unique divisors of `n` derived from the conditions specified in the loop. If `n` is a perfect square, the square root is listed only once. If `n` is a prime number, `l` is a list containing `1` and `n`.**
