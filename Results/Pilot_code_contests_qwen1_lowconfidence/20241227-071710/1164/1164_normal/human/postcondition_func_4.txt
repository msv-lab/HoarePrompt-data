The function prompts the user to input an integer `n` representing the length of the sequence, followed by `n` integers representing the initial sequence. Then, it takes an integer `q` indicating the number of changes to be applied to the sequence. Finally, it processes `q` lines, each containing three integers `l`, `r`, and `x` that describe the changes to the sequence (e.g., changing elements from index `l` to `r` by adding `x` to each element). The function returns an integer input by the user, which represents the length of the sequence, the sequence itself, and the number of changes `q`. However, the function does not actually process or apply the changes to the sequence; it only reads the inputs and returns them.
