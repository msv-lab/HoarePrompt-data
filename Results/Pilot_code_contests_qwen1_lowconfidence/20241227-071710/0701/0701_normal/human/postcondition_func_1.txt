The function `func_2()` accepts no parameters and reads a single line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin). It then returns a map object containing these integers. The function expects the input to be provided as a single line of space-separated integers. If the input does not conform to this expectation, the behavior is undefined. There are no error checks for invalid input formats.
