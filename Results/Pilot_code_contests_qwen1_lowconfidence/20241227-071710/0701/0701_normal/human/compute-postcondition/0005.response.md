The code `sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` writes the string representation of the variable `s` followed by a space to the standard output. This operation does not change the values of the variables `n` or `args`. It only affects the standard output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300\), `args` must be a non-empty list with one less element than before, the standard output contains the string representation of the next `s` followed by a space**
