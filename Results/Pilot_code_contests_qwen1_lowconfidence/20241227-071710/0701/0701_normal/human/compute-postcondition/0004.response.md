Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300\).
   - `args` must be a non-empty list.
   - The standard output contains the string representation of `s` followed by a space (with one element processed).

2. **Understand the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `s` in the list `args`.
   - For each iteration, the standard output contains the string representation of `s` followed by a space.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `args` to process.
   - Since the standard output shows that one element has already been processed, `args` must have had at least two elements initially.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - After processing one element, `args` should now contain one less element.
   - The condition for `args` must still hold true (i.e., it must remain a non-empty list).

Given these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

- `n` remains unchanged since it is not directly involved in the loop's iteration.
- `args` should now be a non-empty list with one less element than before.
- The standard output indicates that one element has been processed, so the next element in the list will be processed in the next iteration.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300\), `args` must be a non-empty list with one less element than before, the standard output contains the string representation of the next `s` followed by a space**.
