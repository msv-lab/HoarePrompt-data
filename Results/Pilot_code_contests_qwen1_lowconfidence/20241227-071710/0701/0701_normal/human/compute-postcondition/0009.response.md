Functionality: **The function `func_4()` takes no parameters and returns nothing (`None`). It iterates over the `args` list and writes each element (converted to a string) followed by a space to the standard output. After the iteration, it writes a newline character to the standard output. If `args` is empty, it will simply write a newline character without writing any elements. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not have any missing functionality based on the given information.**
