The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` does not affect the variables `n` and `args`. Instead, it writes the string representation of `s` followed by a space to the standard output. Since the initial state does not specify what `s` is, we cannot determine the exact output written to the standard output. However, we know that `s` is a variable that holds some value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 300, `args` must be a non-empty list, the standard output contains the string representation of `s` followed by a space**
