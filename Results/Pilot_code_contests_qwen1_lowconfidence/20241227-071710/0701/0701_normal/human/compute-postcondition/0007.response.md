The code `sys.stdout.write('\n')` writes a newline character to the standard output. This does not change the value of the variables `n` or `args`. The standard output will now include a newline character after the previous string representations of the elements in `args`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300\), `args` is a list with no elements left, the standard output contains the string representation of all elements in `args` followed by a newline character.**
