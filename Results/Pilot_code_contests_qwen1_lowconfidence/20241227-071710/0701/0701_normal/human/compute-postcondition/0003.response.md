The code `sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` writes the string representation of `s` followed by a space to the standard output. This operation does not change the values of the variables `n` or `args`. The value of `s` is written to the standard output, but its value in memory remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 300, `args` must be a non-empty list, the standard output contains the string representation of `s` followed by a space (with one element processed)**
