The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. The parameter `n` mentioned is not used within the function, and thus does not affect the function's behavior. The function does not return any specific value based on input parameters since there are none.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to return nothing (or more precisely, to return `None`).

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing (`None`).**
