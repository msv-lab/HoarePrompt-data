The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from the standard input (e.g., the user keyboard input) and returns it as a string. There are no parameters required for this function. An edge case to consider is if the input is empty (i.e., the user presses Enter without typing anything), in which case the function will still return an empty string. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; however, it is worth noting that the function does not perform any additional processing on the input string, such as trimming whitespace or checking for specific patterns.
