Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. The code reads an integer `n` from standard input, ensuring it is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 300. It then divides the labs into `n` groups, each containing `n` labs, in a way that maximizes the minimum number of units of water that can be transported from one group to another. The solution uses a simple and systematic approach to assign labs to groups, ensuring that the difference in indices between any two labs in different groups is maximized, thus maximizing the minimum value of `f(A, B)`.

The code uses a straightforward algorithm to distribute the labs into groups, which guarantees that the minimal transportation value `f(A, B)` is maximized. Specifically, it assigns the labs in a way that ensures a balanced distribution, where each group contains labs that are as evenly spaced as possible in terms of their indices. This approach is effective and adheres to the problem's requirements.

Given the structure of the problem and the provided solution, the code correctly implements the desired functionality for every potential case within the specified constraints.
