Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to divide the labs into \( n \) groups, each containing exactly \( n \) labs, such that the minimum value of \( f(A, B) \) is maximized. Here’s the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_1()` reads an integer \( n \) from standard input, ensuring it is within the valid range (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 300).
2. **Dividing Labs into Groups**: The program initializes an empty list `ans` with \( n \) sublists, each of length \( n \). It then fills these sublists with consecutive numbers starting from 1 up to \( n^2 \), distributing them evenly across the \( n \) sublists. This ensures each group contains exactly \( n \) labs.
3. **Outputting Groups**: The program converts each number in the `ans` list to a string and joins them with spaces, then prints each sublist on a new line. This output format matches the required format of the problem.

Given the problem description and the annotations, the program logically divides the labs into \( n \) groups as required and outputs the results in the correct format. The key aspect of maximizing the minimum \( f(A, B) \) value is achieved by evenly distributing the labs across the groups, which inherently ensures that the differences in lab indices between any two groups are minimized.

Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **False** is not accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The program meets the problem requirements as stated.
