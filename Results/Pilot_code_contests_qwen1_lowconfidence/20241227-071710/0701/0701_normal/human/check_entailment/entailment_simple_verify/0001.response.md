Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly implements the logic to divide the labs into \( n \) groups, each containing exactly \( n \) labs. The annotated version clearly shows that the program initializes the list `ans` to store the groups and then fills it according to the given constraints. Each group is filled sequentially, ensuring that the labs are distributed in a manner consistent with the problem statement.

The program then converts the lab numbers in each group to strings and prints them out in the required format. This ensures that the output matches the expected format, where each line contains \( n \) numbers representing the labs in each group.

Given that the annotated version accurately reflects the logic and the program meets the requirements of the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being **False** is inaccurate. Therefore, the program is correct, and the final assessment is **True**.
