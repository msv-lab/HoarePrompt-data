Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program consists only of function definitions and does not include any implementation of the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not contain any code that divides the labs into \( n \) groups or calculates the values of \( f(A, B) \) to ensure that the minimum value is maximized. 

Since the program does not implement the necessary logic to meet the requirements described in the problem statement, it cannot be considered correct.
