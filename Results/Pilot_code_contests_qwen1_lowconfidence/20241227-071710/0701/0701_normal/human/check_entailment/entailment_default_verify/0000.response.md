Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The code consists of utility functions for reading input and writing output but does not implement any logic to solve the problem of dividing the labs into groups to maximize the minimum number of units of water that can be transported between groups. The function `func_4` simply prints the provided arguments, which does not contribute to solving the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
