Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided Python program consists solely of function definitions and does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. The functions defined (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) do not perform the necessary operations to divide the labs into groups or calculate the values of \( f(A, B) \). The `func_4` function simply writes a sequence of numbers followed by a newline to the standard output, which does not contribute to solving the problem. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is not correct.
