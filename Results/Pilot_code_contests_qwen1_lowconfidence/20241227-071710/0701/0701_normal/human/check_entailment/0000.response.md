Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic for dividing the labs into groups or calculating the minimum number of units of water that can be transported between groups. The functions defined (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`) are utility functions for reading input and writing output but do not address the core problem of grouping the labs to maximize the minimum water transportation between groups.

To verify this, consider the following:
- The problem requires dividing \(n^2\) labs into \(n\) groups of size \(n\).
- The goal is to maximize the minimum number of units of water that can be transported from one group to another.
- The program does not implement any algorithm or logic to achieve this goal.

Since the program does not contain any code that attempts to solve the problem as described, it cannot be considered correct. Therefore, the output is `False`.
