You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: In order to do some research, n^2 labs are built on different heights of a mountain. Let's enumerate them with integers from 1 to n^2, such that the lab with the number 1 is at the lowest place, the lab with the number 2 is at the second-lowest place, …, the lab with the number n^2 is at the highest place.

To transport water between the labs, pipes are built between every pair of labs. A pipe can transport at most one unit of water at a time from the lab with the number u to the lab with the number v if u > v.

Now the labs need to be divided into n groups, each group should contain exactly n labs. The labs from different groups can transport water to each other. The sum of units of water that can be sent from a group A to a group B is equal to the number of pairs of labs (u, v) such that the lab with the number u is from the group A, the lab with the number v is from the group B and u > v. Let's denote this value as f(A,B) (i.e. f(A,B) is the sum of units of water that can be sent from a group A to a group B).

For example, if n=3 and there are 3 groups X, Y and Z: X = \{1, 5, 6\}, Y = \{2, 4, 9\} and Z = \{3, 7, 8\}. In this case, the values of f are equal to:

  * f(X,Y)=4 because of 5 → 2, 5 → 4, 6 → 2, 6 → 4, 
  * f(X,Z)=2 because of 5 → 3, 6 → 3, 
  * f(Y,X)=5 because of 2 → 1, 4 → 1, 9 → 1, 9 → 5, 9 → 6, 
  * f(Y,Z)=4 because of 4 → 3, 9 → 3, 9 → 7, 9 → 8, 
  * f(Z,X)=7 because of 3 → 1, 7 → 1, 7 → 5, 7 → 6, 8 → 1, 8 → 5, 8 → 6, 
  * f(Z,Y)=5 because of 3 → 2, 7 → 2, 7 → 4, 8 → 2, 8 → 4. 



Please, divide labs into n groups with size n, such that the value min f(A,B) over all possible pairs of groups A and B (A ≠ B) is maximal.

In other words, divide labs into n groups with size n, such that minimum number of the sum of units of water that can be transported from a group A to a group B for every pair of different groups A and B (A ≠ B) as big as possible.

Note, that the example above doesn't demonstrate an optimal division, but it demonstrates how to calculate the values f for some division.

If there are many optimal divisions, you can find any.

Input

The only line contains one number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300).

Output

Output n lines:

In the i-th line print n numbers, the numbers of labs of the i-th group, in any order you want.

If there are multiple answers, that maximize the minimum number of the sum of units of water that can be transported from one group the another, you can print any.

Example

Input


3


Output


2 8 5
9 3 4
7 6 1

Note

In the first test we can divide 9 labs into groups \{2, 8, 5\}, \{9, 3, 4\}, \{7, 6, 1\}.

From the first group to the second group we can transport 4 units of water (8 → 3, 8 → 4, 5 → 3, 5 → 4).

From the first group to the third group we can transport 5 units of water (2 → 1, 8 → 7, 8 → 6, 8 → 1, 5 → 1).

From the second group to the first group we can transport 5 units of water (9 → 2, 9 → 8, 9 → 5, 3 → 2, 4 → 2).

From the second group to the third group we can transport 5 units of water (9 → 7, 9 → 6, 9 → 1, 3 → 1, 4 → 1).

From the third group to the first group we can transport 4 units of water (7 → 2, 7 → 5, 6 → 2, 6 → 5).

From the third group to the second group we can transport 4 units of water (7 → 3, 7 → 4, 6 → 3, 6 → 4).

The minimal number of the sum of units of water, that can be transported from one group to another is equal to 4. It can be proved, that it is impossible to make a better division.
