#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 300.
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer input from standard input, which is within the range 2 <= n <= 300
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from standard input and ensures that the input is within the range 2 <= n <= 300. If the input is valid, it returns the integer. If the input is invalid (either less than 2 or greater than 300), the function will repeatedly prompt the user until a valid input is provided. The final state of the program is that it returns an integer input from standard input, which is guaranteed to be within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_2()` are provided in the function signature. The function reads input from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing integers. The input is expected to be a single line of space-separated integers representing the value of n.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers read from stdin as a single line of space-separated integers representing the value of n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts no parameters and reads a single line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin). It then returns a map object containing these integers. The function expects the input to be provided as a single line of space-separated integers. If the input does not conform to this expectation, the behavior is undefined. There are no error checks for invalid input formats.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no information provided about the input or variables used in the `func_3` function signature. The function does not take any parameters and reads a single line from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline()
    #The program returns a string read from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from the standard input (e.g., the user keyboard input) and returns it as a string. There are no parameters required for this function. An edge case to consider is if the input is empty (i.e., the user presses Enter without typing anything), in which case the function will still return an empty string. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; however, it is worth noting that the function does not perform any additional processing on the input string, such as trimming whitespace or checking for specific patterns.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 300. The function does not use the variable n or any of the args provided, and it is not directly related to solving the main problem described.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300\), `args` is a list with no elements left, the standard output contains the string representation of all elements in `args` followed by spaces.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` takes no parameters and returns nothing (`None`). It iterates over the `args` list and writes each element (converted to a string) followed by a space to the standard output. After the iteration, it writes a newline character to the standard output. If `args` is empty, it will simply write a newline character without writing any elements. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code does not have any missing functionality based on the given information.
