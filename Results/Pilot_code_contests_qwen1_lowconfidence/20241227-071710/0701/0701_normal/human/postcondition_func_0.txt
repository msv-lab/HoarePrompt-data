The function `func_1` reads an integer input from standard input and ensures that the input is within the range 2 <= n <= 300. If the input is valid, it returns the integer. If the input is invalid (either less than 2 or greater than 300), the function will repeatedly prompt the user until a valid input is provided. The final state of the program is that it returns an integer input from standard input, which is guaranteed to be within the specified range.
