The function `func_5()` accepts no parameters directly but relies on an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list of `n` space-separated integers each being either 1 or 2, which are provided through `func_4()`. The function then returns a list generated by `func_4()`. Since the code does not contain any implementation details within `func_5()`, the only action performed is to return the result of `func_4()`. This implies that the function `func_5()` is merely a wrapper that ensures the correct inputs are passed to `func_4()` and the output is returned without any additional modifications.
