The function `func_1` writes a sequence of arguments to a file with specified separators and formatting options. It processes each argument in the `args` list, writing them to the `file` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) with `sep` (defaulting to a single space `b' '`), except the first one which is not prefixed by `sep`. After writing all arguments, it appends the value associated with the key `'end'` in `kwargs` (defaulting to `b'\n'`). If the key `'flush'` is present in `kwargs` and its value is `True`, it flushes the `file`.
