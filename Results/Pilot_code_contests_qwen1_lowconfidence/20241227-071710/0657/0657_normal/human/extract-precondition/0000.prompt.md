You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: We're giving away nice huge bags containing number tiles! A bag we want to present to you contains n tiles. Each of them has a single number written on it — either 1 or 2.

However, there is one condition you must fulfill in order to receive the prize. You will need to put all the tiles from the bag in a sequence, in any order you wish. We will then compute the sums of all prefixes in the sequence, and then count how many of these sums are prime numbers. If you want to keep the prize, you will need to maximize the number of primes you get.

Can you win the prize? Hurry up, the bags are waiting!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of number tiles in the bag. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i ∈ \{1, 2\}) — the values written on the tiles.

Output

Output a permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_n of the input sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) maximizing the number of the prefix sums being prime numbers. If there are multiple optimal permutations, output any.

Examples

Input


5
1 2 1 2 1


Output


1 1 1 2 2


Input


9
1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1


Output


1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1

Note

The first solution produces the prefix sums 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}} (four primes constructed), while the prefix sums in the second solution are 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, 6, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}}, 8, 10, \mathbf{\color{blue}{11}} (five primes). Primes are marked bold and blue. In each of these cases, the number of produced primes is maximum possible.
