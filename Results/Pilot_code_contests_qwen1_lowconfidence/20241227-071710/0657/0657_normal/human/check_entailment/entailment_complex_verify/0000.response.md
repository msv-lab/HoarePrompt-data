Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly generate a permutation that maximizes the number of prefix sums being prime numbers. Specifically, the logic used in `func_14` does not ensure that the prefix sums are maximized in terms of being prime. The annotated version clarifies that the sequence generation logic does not guarantee the prefix sums will be prime, as demonstrated by the commented-out sections and the active sections. The provided example input and the annotated code both highlight this issue, confirming that the program fails to meet the problem requirements.
