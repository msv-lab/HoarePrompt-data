You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We're giving away nice huge bags containing number tiles! A bag we want to present to you contains n tiles. Each of them has a single number written on it — either 1 or 2.

However, there is one condition you must fulfill in order to receive the prize. You will need to put all the tiles from the bag in a sequence, in any order you wish. We will then compute the sums of all prefixes in the sequence, and then count how many of these sums are prime numbers. If you want to keep the prize, you will need to maximize the number of primes you get.

Can you win the prize? Hurry up, the bags are waiting!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of number tiles in the bag. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i ∈ \{1, 2\}) — the values written on the tiles.

Output

Output a permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_n of the input sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) maximizing the number of the prefix sums being prime numbers. If there are multiple optimal permutations, output any.

Examples

Input


5
1 2 1 2 1


Output


1 1 1 2 2


Input


9
1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1


Output


1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1

Note

The first solution produces the prefix sums 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}} (four primes constructed), while the prefix sums in the second solution are 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, 6, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}}, 8, 10, \mathbf{\color{blue}{11}} (five primes). Primes are marked bold and blue. In each of these cases, the number of produced primes is maximum possible.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation that maximizes the number of prefix sums being prime numbers. The program seems to attempt to construct a sequence based on the counts of 1s and 2s, but it does not guarantee that the prefix sums will be maximized in terms of being prime.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
3
2 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
A valid output should be a permutation that maximizes the number of prefix sums that are prime. For example, `[2, 1, 1]` results in prefix sums `2`, `3`, `4`. Here, only `2` and `3` are prime, so the output could be `[2, 1, 1]` or `[1, 2, 1]` (both resulting in the same prefix sums).

However, the provided program generates a sequence `[2]` followed by a series of additions that do not necessarily ensure the prefix sums are maximized in terms of being prime. This is evident in the following lines:

```python
s = [2]
p = [2]
two -= 1
for i in range(1, n):
    if p[-1] % 2 == 0:
        if one != 0:
            s.append(1)
            p.append(p[-1] + 1)
            one -= 1
        else:
            s.append(2)
            p.append(p[-1] + 2)
            two -= 1
    elif two != 0:
        s.append(2)
        p.append(p[-1] + 2)
        two -= 1
    else:
        s.append(1)
        p.append(p[-1] + 1)
        one -= 1
```

This logic does not ensure that the prefix sums are maximized in terms of being prime. Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output for all inputs, leading to a **False** correctness verdict.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct relationship or precondition involving variables related to the number tiles or their arrangement within the function `func_1`. This function does not contribute to solving the main problem described. It appears to be a separate utility function for writing arguments to a file with specified separators and other formatting options.
def func_1():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `file` contains the concatenation of all elements in `args` with `sep` between each pair of elements, starting from the second element, `args` is a list containing all original elements, `sep` is `b' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `kwargs` remains unchanged.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `file` is `sys.stdout` with the concatenated string of `args` and `b'\n'` appended, `args` is a list containing all original elements, `sep` is `b' '`, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'` and `'flush'` and retains any other unchanged keys.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` writes a sequence of arguments to a file with specified separators and formatting options. It processes each argument in the `args` list, writing them to the `file` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) with `sep` (defaulting to a single space `b' '`), except the first one which is not prefixed by `sep`. After writing all arguments, it appends the value associated with the key `'end'` in `kwargs` (defaulting to `b'\n'`). If the key `'flush'` is present in `kwargs` and its value is `True`, it flushes the `file`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided, but the function reads an integer input representing the number of number tiles in the bag.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input representing the number of number tiles in the bag
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer input from the user representing the number of number tiles in a bag and returns that integer. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond reading the input. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, in which case the program will raise a `ValueError`. No other functionality or actions are specified in the provided code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_3()` are defined in its signature, so there are no explicit preconditions provided. However, based on the problem description, `func_3` should be part of a larger solution where `n` and the list of tiles `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are provided as input to the main function, not within `func_3`.
def func_3():
    return str(input())
    #The program returns a string input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to enter a string. It then returns this string input. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that handle special inputs such as empty strings or non-string inputs. The function simply reads a line of text from the standard input and returns it as a string.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided in the code snippet. However, the function `func_4()` reads input from the standard input, which consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (the number of number tiles in the bag), and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the values written on the tiles (either 1 or 2).
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from the second line of input, where the input consists of the number of number tiles followed by their values (either 1 or 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` reads input from the standard input, consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n`, representing the number of number tiles in the bag, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers, each either 1 or 2, representing the values written on the tiles. The function returns a map object containing these integers. Potential edge cases include the possibility that the second line might not contain exactly `n` integers, or the integers might not be either 1 or 2. In such cases, the function will still attempt to parse the integers, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the following line of input contains n space-separated integers each being either 1 or 2.
def func_5():
    return list(func_4())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_4(), which takes as input an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list of n space-separated integers each being either 1 or 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5()` accepts no parameters directly but relies on an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list of `n` space-separated integers each being either 1 or 2, which are provided through `func_4()`. The function then returns a list generated by `func_4()`. Since the code does not contain any implementation details within `func_5()`, the only action performed is to return the result of `func_4()`. This implies that the function `func_5()` is merely a wrapper that ensures the correct inputs are passed to `func_4()` and the output is returned without any additional modifications.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the first element is of a type that can be compared and sorted (e.g., integer, float, string).
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
    #The program returns the first element of the tuple or list 'item', which is of a type that can be compared and sorted
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be a tuple or list containing at least one element. The function returns the first element of `item`. The first element is expected to be of a type that can be compared and sorted (e.g., integer, float, string). If `item` is an empty tuple or list, the function will raise an `IndexError`. No additional actions are performed by the function beyond returning the first element.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2.
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers from 'l', where each integer is either 1 or 2, using the 'getKey' function as the sorting key
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l`, using the `getKey` function as the sorting key. The returned list contains the same elements as `l`, but in ascending order based on the values returned by `getKey`. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If `l` contains only one element, the function returns a list with that single element. No other modifications are made to the original list `l`; it remains unchanged.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list, and num is an integer either 1 or 2.
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list with 'n' rows and 'm' columns, where each element in the list is equal to 'num', which is either 1 or 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list, and `num` is an integer either 1 or 2. The function returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is equal to `num`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that constructs the 2D list with the specified dimensions and fills it with the value `num`. The function handles the case where `n` or `m` could be zero, resulting in an empty 2D list. No other edge cases are explicitly mentioned, but the code itself does not handle scenarios where `num` is neither 1 nor 2, which would result in an incorrect behavior according to the annotations.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_9(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns True if x is 0 or False if x is a non-zero non-negative integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, and `False` if `x` is any other non-negative integer. The function achieves this by evaluating the expression `return x and not x & x - 1`. This expression effectively checks if `x` is 0. If `x` is 0, `x & x - 1` results in 0 (since 0 & anything is 0), and `not 0` evaluates to `True`. If `x` is any other non-negative integer, `x & x - 1` is non-zero, making the entire expression evaluate to `False`. This covers all potential cases where `x` can be a non-negative integer.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{200,000}.
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns a binary string representation of integer 'n', without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{200,000}\), and returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. The function converts the integer `n` to its binary form using Python’s built-in `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix. This conversion handles all valid integers within the specified range, including the minimum value (1) and the maximum value (\(2^{200,000}\)). The function ensures that the output is a valid binary string representation of the input integer.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the binary representation of n consists only of the digits 1 and 2.
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2 based on the binary representation of the initial integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the binary representation of `n` consists only of the digits 1 and 2. It converts `n` into its binary representation, where each digit in the binary form is extracted and converted to an integer (either 1 or 2), and returns a list of these integers. The function handles the given constraints and ensures that the output list correctly represents the binary digits of `n`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned, but the function will work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range and binary constraints.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer, y is a positive integer, and p is a prime number.
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: `y` is 0, `res` is the result of `x^k % p` where `k` is the number of times `y` was odd, `x` is the final value after all squaring operations, `p` and `p1` remain unchanged.
    return res
    #`The program returns res which is the result of x^k % p where k is the number of times y was odd, and x is the final value after all squaring operations`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer), `y` (a positive integer), and `p` (a prime number). It calculates and returns `res`, which is the result of \( x^k \mod p \), where \( k \) is the number of times `y` is odd. This is achieved through a loop that squares `x` and multiplies `res` by `x` when `y` is odd. After the loop, `y` becomes 0, and `res` holds the desired result. The function handles the case where `y` is even by only squaring `x` without modifying `res`. If `y` is initially 0, the function will directly return 1 since no multiplication needs to occur.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, and x and y represent two numbers whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is to be computed.
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x_0` and `y_0`; `y` is 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `x_0` and `y_0`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the function returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function handles the case where either `x` or `y` is zero by reducing the problem to finding the GCD of the non-zero number and the remainder when the non-zero number is divided by the zero number. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function will enter an infinite loop since the condition `while y:` will always be true. Therefore, it is assumed that at least one of the inputs is non-zero.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is a sequence of `1`s and `2`s starting with `2` and having a length of `n`, `one` is `0`, `two` is `0`, `p` is a list of integers starting with `2` and having a length of `n`, with the last element being even if `one` was used in the last iteration and odd if `two` was used in the last iteration.
    func_1(*s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14()` accepts no direct parameters but relies on values returned by `func_2()` and `func_5()`. It generates a list `s` of length `n` (where `n` is the result of `func_2()`), consisting of integers `1` and `2`. The list starts with `2` and alternates between `1` and `2` based on the counts of `1`s and `2`s in the list `l` (returned by `func_5()`). If the counts of `1`s and `2`s are equal, it fills `s` with alternating `1`s and `2`s starting from `2`. Otherwise, it uses the available `1`s and `2`s to fill `s` while maintaining the count of `1`s and `2`s. The function ensures that the list `p` is constructed such that each element is the sum of the previous element and either `1` or `2` based on the choice of `1` or `2` in `s`. Finally, the function calls `func_1(*s)` with the generated list `s`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
