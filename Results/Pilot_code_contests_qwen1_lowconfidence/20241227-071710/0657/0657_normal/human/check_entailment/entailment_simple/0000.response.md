Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The main issue lies in the logic implemented in `func_14`, which is supposed to generate a permutation of the input list `l` that maximizes the number of prefix sums being prime numbers. Let's analyze why the current implementation is flawed:

1. **Initial Assumptions and Logic Flaws:**
   - The initial logic in `func_14` tries to construct a sequence `s` by alternating `1`s and `2`s, which is a naive approach and does not guarantee the maximum number of prime prefix sums.
   - The commented-out section of the code is more complex and attempts to handle different cases of counts of `1`s and `2`s, but it still does not guarantee the optimal solution.

2. **Current Implementation Issues:**
   - The current implementation initializes `s` with `[2]` and then iterates through the remaining indices, appending `1`s and `2`s based on certain conditions. However, this approach does not necessarily lead to the maximum number of prime prefix sums.
   - The logic to append `1`s and `2`s is based on the parity of the previous prefix sum (`p[-1]`), which might not always yield the best sequence.

3. **Example Counter-Case:**
   - Consider an input like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2]`. The current implementation might produce a sequence like `[2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, which results in prefix sums of `[2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. This sequence only has 3 prime prefix sums (`2, 3, 5, 7`), which is not the maximum possible.

4. **Optimal Solution Approach:**
   - To maximize the number of prime prefix sums, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One effective strategy is to start with `2` and then alternate between `1`s and `2`s in a way that ensures the maximum number of prefix sums are prime. For example, the sequence `[2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, ...]` could potentially yield more prime prefix sums.

### Correct Implementation Outline:
1. Start with `2`.
2. Append `1`s and `2`s in a way that ensures the prefix sums are as likely as possible to be prime.
3. Use a dynamic programming or greedy approach to ensure the maximum number of prime prefix sums.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
