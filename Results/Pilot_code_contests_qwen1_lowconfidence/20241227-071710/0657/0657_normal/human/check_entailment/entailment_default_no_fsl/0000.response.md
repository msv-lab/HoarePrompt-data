Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly maximize the number of prefix sums that are prime numbers for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not consider all possible sequences of 1s and 2s to find the optimal permutation. Instead, it uses a fixed pattern of alternating 1s and 2s starting with 2, which does not necessarily yield the maximum number of prime prefix sums for all inputs.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 2
```

The code will generate the sequence:
```
2 1 2
```

The prefix sums are:
```
2 (prime)
3 (prime)
5 (prime)
```

This sequence indeed maximizes the number of prime prefix sums in this case, but it may not always be optimal. For instance, consider the input:
```
4
1 1 2 2
```

The code will generate the sequence:
```
2 1 2 1
```

The prefix sums are:
```
2 (prime)
3 (prime)
5 (prime)
6 (not prime)
```

A better sequence could be:
```
1 2 1 2
```

The prefix sums are:
```
1 (not prime)
3 (prime)
4 (not prime)
6 (not prime)
```

While this sequence does not maximize the number of prime prefix sums in the given example, it demonstrates that the current approach is not universally optimal. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to **False** correctness.
