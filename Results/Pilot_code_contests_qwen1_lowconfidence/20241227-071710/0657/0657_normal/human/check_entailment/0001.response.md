Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to maximize the number of prefix sums that are prime numbers. However, the logic in the code is flawed and does not guarantee the optimal permutation for all inputs. Specifically, the code has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Prime Sum Calculation**: The code tries to append `1` and `2` in a way that does not necessarily maximize the number of prime prefix sums. For instance, consider the input `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`. The code may produce a sequence like `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1]`, which results in prefix sums `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`. Here, only three prefix sums (2, 3, 5) are prime, but the optimal sequence would be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`, which results in prefix sums `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, with four prefix sums (2, 3) being prime.

2. **Hardcoded Values**: The code uses hardcoded values (`[1, 1, 1, 2] * 50000`) for testing, which does not cover all possible scenarios. This means the logic might fail for more complex or different input distributions.

3. **Incomplete Logic Handling**: The conditional checks and assignments within the loop do not fully address all edge cases. For example, the logic for appending `1` or `2` based on the parity of the last sum and the remaining counts of `1`s and `2`s is not sufficient to ensure the maximum number of prime prefix sums for all inputs.

To fix this, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as a dynamic programming or greedy algorithm to construct the optimal sequence. Without addressing these issues, the code cannot be considered correct for every potential case.
