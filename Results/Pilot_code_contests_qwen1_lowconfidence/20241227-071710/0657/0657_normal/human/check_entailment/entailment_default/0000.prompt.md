You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We're giving away nice huge bags containing number tiles! A bag we want to present to you contains n tiles. Each of them has a single number written on it — either 1 or 2.

However, there is one condition you must fulfill in order to receive the prize. You will need to put all the tiles from the bag in a sequence, in any order you wish. We will then compute the sums of all prefixes in the sequence, and then count how many of these sums are prime numbers. If you want to keep the prize, you will need to maximize the number of primes you get.

Can you win the prize? Hurry up, the bags are waiting!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of number tiles in the bag. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i ∈ \{1, 2\}) — the values written on the tiles.

Output

Output a permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_n of the input sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) maximizing the number of the prefix sums being prime numbers. If there are multiple optimal permutations, output any.

Examples

Input


5
1 2 1 2 1


Output


1 1 1 2 2


Input


9
1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1


Output


1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1

Note

The first solution produces the prefix sums 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}} (four primes constructed), while the prefix sums in the second solution are 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, 6, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}}, 8, 10, \mathbf{\color{blue}{11}} (five primes). Primes are marked bold and blue. In each of these cases, the number of produced primes is maximum possible.

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` writes a sequence of arguments to a file with specified separators and formatting options. It processes each argument in the `args` list, writing them to the `file` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) with `sep` (defaulting to a single space `b' '`), except the first one which is not prefixed by `sep`. After writing all arguments, it appends the value associated with the key `'end'` in `kwargs` (defaulting to `b'\n'`). If the key `'flush'` is present in `kwargs` and its value is `True`, it flushes the `file`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads an integer input from the user representing the number of number tiles in a bag and returns that integer. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond reading the input. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, in which case the program will raise a `ValueError`. No other functionality or actions are specified in the provided code.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return str(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to enter a string. It then returns this string input. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that handle special inputs such as empty strings or non-string inputs. The function simply reads a line of text from the standard input and returns it as a string.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4()` reads input from the standard input, consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n`, representing the number of number tiles in the bag, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers, each either 1 or 2, representing the values written on the tiles. The function returns a map object containing these integers. Potential edge cases include the possibility that the second line might not contain exactly `n` integers, or the integers might not be either 1 or 2. In such cases, the function will still attempt to parse the integers, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_4())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5()` accepts no parameters directly but relies on an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list of `n` space-separated integers each being either 1 or 2, which are provided through `func_4()`. The function then returns a list generated by `func_4()`. Since the code does not contain any implementation details within `func_5()`, the only action performed is to return the result of `func_4()`. This implies that the function `func_5()` is merely a wrapper that ensures the correct inputs are passed to `func_4()` and the output is returned without any additional modifications.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be a tuple or list containing at least one element. The function returns the first element of `item`. The first element is expected to be of a type that can be compared and sorted (e.g., integer, float, string). If `item` is an empty tuple or list, the function will raise an `IndexError`. No additional actions are performed by the function beyond returning the first element.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l`, using the `getKey` function as the sorting key. The returned list contains the same elements as `l`, but in ascending order based on the values returned by `getKey`. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If `l` contains only one element, the function returns a list with that single element. No other modifications are made to the original list `l`; it remains unchanged.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list, and `num` is an integer either 1 or 2. The function returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is equal to `num`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that constructs the 2D list with the specified dimensions and fills it with the value `num`. The function handles the case where `n` or `m` could be zero, resulting in an empty 2D list. No other edge cases are explicitly mentioned, but the code itself does not handle scenarios where `num` is neither 1 nor 2, which would result in an incorrect behavior according to the annotations.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, and `False` if `x` is any other non-negative integer. The function achieves this by evaluating the expression `return x and not x & x - 1`. This expression effectively checks if `x` is 0. If `x` is 0, `x & x - 1` results in 0 (since 0 & anything is 0), and `not 0` evaluates to `True`. If `x` is any other non-negative integer, `x & x - 1` is non-zero, making the entire expression evaluate to `False`. This covers all potential cases where `x` can be a non-negative integer.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2^{200,000}\), and returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. The function converts the integer `n` to its binary form using Python’s built-in `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix. This conversion handles all valid integers within the specified range, including the minimum value (1) and the maximum value (\(2^{200,000}\)). The function ensures that the output is a valid binary string representation of the input integer.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the binary representation of `n` consists only of the digits 1 and 2. It converts `n` into its binary representation, where each digit in the binary form is extracted and converted to an integer (either 1 or 2), and returns a list of these integers. The function handles the given constraints and ensures that the output list correctly represents the binary digits of `n`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned, but the function will work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range and binary constraints.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p1
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer), `y` (a positive integer), and `p` (a prime number). It calculates and returns `res`, which is the result of \( x^k \mod p \), where \( k \) is the number of times `y` is odd. This is achieved through a loop that squares `x` and multiplies `res` by `x` when `y` is odd. After the loop, `y` becomes 0, and `res` holds the desired result. The function handles the case where `y` is even by only squaring `x` without modifying `res`. If `y` is initially 0, the function will directly return 1 since no multiplication needs to occur.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the function returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function handles the case where either `x` or `y` is zero by reducing the problem to finding the GCD of the non-zero number and the remainder when the non-zero number is divided by the zero number. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function will enter an infinite loop since the condition `while y:` will always be true. Therefore, it is assumed that at least one of the inputs is non-zero.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''

    func_1(*s)
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14()` accepts no direct parameters but relies on values returned by `func_2()` and `func_5()`. It generates a list `s` of length `n` (where `n` is the result of `func_2()`), consisting of integers `1` and `2`. The list starts with `2` and alternates between `1` and `2` based on the counts of `1`s and `2`s in the list `l` (returned by `func_5()`). If the counts of `1`s and `2`s are equal, it fills `s` with alternating `1`s and `2`s starting from `2`. Otherwise, it uses the available `1`s and `2`s to fill `s` while maintaining the count of `1`s and `2`s. The function ensures that the list `p` is constructed such that each element is the sum of the previous element and either `1` or `2` based on the choice of `1` or `2` in `s`. Finally, the function calls `func_1(*s)` with the generated list `s`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
