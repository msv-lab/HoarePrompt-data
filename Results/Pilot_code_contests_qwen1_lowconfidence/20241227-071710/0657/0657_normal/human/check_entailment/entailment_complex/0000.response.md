Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the case where the counts of 1's and 2's in the input list `l` are not equal. 

The code attempts to alternate between 1's and 2's to maximize the number of prefix sums that are prime numbers. However, it does not ensure that the sequence generated maximizes the number of prime prefix sums in all cases. For instance, consider the following input:

**Input:**
```
3
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 1
```

This sequence gives prefix sums 1, 3, 4. Here, only 3 is a prime number, which is the maximum possible.

However, the current implementation does not guarantee this outcome. The code tries to generate a sequence by alternating between 1's and 2's, but it does not consider the exact distribution of 1's and 2's to maximize the number of prime prefix sums. As a result, it may produce suboptimal sequences in some cases.

For example, for the above input, the code might produce a sequence like `[2, 1, 2]` or `[1, 2, 2]`, which do not achieve the maximum number of prime prefix sums.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
