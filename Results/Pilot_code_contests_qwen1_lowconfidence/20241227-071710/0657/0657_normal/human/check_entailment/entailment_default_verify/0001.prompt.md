You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We're giving away nice huge bags containing number tiles! A bag we want to present to you contains n tiles. Each of them has a single number written on it — either 1 or 2.

However, there is one condition you must fulfill in order to receive the prize. You will need to put all the tiles from the bag in a sequence, in any order you wish. We will then compute the sums of all prefixes in the sequence, and then count how many of these sums are prime numbers. If you want to keep the prize, you will need to maximize the number of primes you get.

Can you win the prize? Hurry up, the bags are waiting!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of number tiles in the bag. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i ∈ \{1, 2\}) — the values written on the tiles.

Output

Output a permutation b_1, b_2, ..., b_n of the input sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) maximizing the number of the prefix sums being prime numbers. If there are multiple optimal permutations, output any.

Examples

Input


5
1 2 1 2 1


Output


1 1 1 2 2


Input


9
1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1


Output


1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1

Note

The first solution produces the prefix sums 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}} (four primes constructed), while the prefix sums in the second solution are 1, \mathbf{\color{blue}{2}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{3}}, \mathbf{\color{blue}{5}}, 6, \mathbf{\color{blue}{7}}, 8, 10, \mathbf{\color{blue}{11}} (five primes). Primes are marked bold and blue. In each of these cases, the number of produced primes is maximum possible.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to maximize the number of prefix sums that are prime numbers. However, the logic in the code is flawed and does not guarantee the optimal permutation for all inputs. Specifically, the code has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Prime Sum Calculation**: The code tries to append `1` and `2` in a way that does not necessarily maximize the number of prime prefix sums. For instance, consider the input `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`. The code may produce a sequence like `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1]`, which results in prefix sums `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`. Here, only three prefix sums (2, 3, 5) are prime, but the optimal sequence would be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`, which results in prefix sums `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`, with four prefix sums (2, 3) being prime.

2. **Hardcoded Values**: The code uses hardcoded values (`[1, 1, 1, 2] * 50000`) for testing, which does not cover all possible scenarios. This means the logic might fail for more complex or different input distributions.

3. **Incomplete Logic Handling**: The conditional checks and assignments within the loop do not fully address all edge cases. For example, the logic for appending `1` or `2` based on the parity of the last sum and the remaining counts of `1`s and `2`s is not sufficient to ensure the maximum number of prime prefix sums for all inputs.

To fix this, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as a dynamic programming or greedy algorithm to construct the optimal sequence. Without addressing these issues, the code cannot be considered correct for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 14 : The function `func_14()` accepts no direct parameters but relies on values returned by `func_2()` and `func_5()`. It generates a list `s` of length `n` (where `n` is the result of `func_2()`), consisting of integers `1` and `2`. The list starts with `2` and alternates between `1` and `2` based on the counts of `1`s and `2`s in the list `l` (returned by `func_5()`). If the counts of `1`s and `2`s are equal, it fills `s` with alternating `1`s and `2`s starting from `2`. Otherwise, it uses the available `1`s and `2`s to fill `s` while maintaining the count of `1`s and `2`s. The function ensures that the list `p` is constructed such that each element is the sum of the previous element and either `1` or `2` based on the choice of `1` or `2` in `s`. Finally, the function calls `func_1(*s)` with the generated list `s`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
