The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, the function returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function handles the case where either `x` or `y` is zero by reducing the problem to finding the GCD of the non-zero number and the remainder when the non-zero number is divided by the zero number. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function will enter an infinite loop since the condition `while y:` will always be true. Therefore, it is assumed that at least one of the inputs is non-zero.
