The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is 0, and `False` if `x` is any other non-negative integer. The function achieves this by evaluating the expression `return x and not x & x - 1`. This expression effectively checks if `x` is 0. If `x` is 0, `x & x - 1` results in 0 (since 0 & anything is 0), and `not 0` evaluates to `True`. If `x` is any other non-negative integer, `x & x - 1` is non-zero, making the entire expression evaluate to `False`. This covers all potential cases where `x` can be a non-negative integer.
