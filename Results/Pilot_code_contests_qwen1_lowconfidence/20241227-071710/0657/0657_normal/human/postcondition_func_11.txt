The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x` (an integer), `y` (a positive integer), and `p` (a prime number). It calculates and returns `res`, which is the result of \( x^k \mod p \), where \( k \) is the number of times `y` is odd. This is achieved through a loop that squares `x` and multiplies `res` by `x` when `y` is odd. After the loop, `y` becomes 0, and `res` holds the desired result. The function handles the case where `y` is even by only squaring `x` without modifying `res`. If `y` is initially 0, the function will directly return 1 since no multiplication needs to occur.
