None of the variables in the function `func_3()` are defined in its signature, so there are no explicit preconditions provided. However, based on the problem description, `func_3` should be part of a larger solution where `n` and the list of tiles `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are provided as input to the main function, not within `func_3`.
