`p.append(p[-1] + 2)` appends to the list `p` the value of its last element plus 2. Given the initial conditions, `p` can be either `[2, 3, 4]` (with the last element being even) or `[2, 4, 6]` (with the last element being even), or `[2, 3, 5]` (with the last element being odd) or `[2, 4, 6]` (with the last element being even).

- If `p` is `[2, 3, 4]`, appending `4 + 2` results in `[2, 3, 4, 6]`.
- If `p` is `[2, 4, 6]`, appending `6 + 2` results in `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
- If `p` is `[2, 3, 5]`, appending `5 + 2` results in `[2, 3, 5, 7]`.

In all cases, the last element of `p` is now even.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is either `[2, 1, 1, 2]`, `[2, 2, 1, 2]`, or `[2, 1, 1, 2]`, `one` is either `one - 2` or `one - 1`, `two` is either -2, -3, or -2, `p` is either `[2, 3, 4, 6]` or `[2, 4, 6, 8]` or `[2, 3, 5, 7]` with the last element being even, `i` is 3**
