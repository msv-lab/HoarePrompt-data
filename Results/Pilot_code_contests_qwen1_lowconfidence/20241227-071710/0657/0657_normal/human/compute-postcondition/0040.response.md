`s` is appended with the value `2`. Since `s` was either `[2, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, or `[2, 1]`, appending `2` to each of these lists results in `[2, 1, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2]`, or `[2, 1, 2]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is either `[2, 1, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2]`, or `[2, 1, 2]`; `one` is either `one - 1` or unchanged; `two` is either -2 or its initial value -1; `p` is either `[2, 3]` or `[2, 4]` with the last element of `p` being even in the if part and odd in the else part; `i` is 2.**
