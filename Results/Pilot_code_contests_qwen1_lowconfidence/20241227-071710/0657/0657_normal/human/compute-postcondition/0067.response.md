Functionality: **The function `func_14()` accepts no direct parameters but relies on values returned by `func_2()` and `func_5()`. It generates a list `s` of length `n` (where `n` is the result of `func_2()`), consisting of integers `1` and `2`. The list starts with `2` and alternates between `1` and `2` based on the counts of `1`s and `2`s in the list `l` (returned by `func_5()`). If the counts of `1`s and `2`s are equal, it fills `s` with alternating `1`s and `2`s starting from `2`. Otherwise, it uses the available `1`s and `2`s to fill `s` while maintaining the count of `1`s and `2`s. The function ensures that the list `p` is constructed such that each element is the sum of the previous element and either `1` or `2` based on the choice of `1` or `2` in `s`. Finally, the function calls `func_1(*s)` with the generated list `s`.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the counts of `1`s and `2`s in `l` are equal, the function generates an alternating sequence starting with `2`.
- If `l` contains more `1`s than `2`s, the function prioritizes `1`s first, then `2`s.
- If `l` contains more `2`s than `1`s, the function prioritizes `2`s first, then `1`s.
- If either `one` or `two` becomes zero before the loop ends, the remaining elements are filled with the remaining `1`s or `2`s.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The original commented-out code had additional logic to handle specific conditions. However, these conditions were removed in the final version, so the function now strictly follows the current logic described above.
