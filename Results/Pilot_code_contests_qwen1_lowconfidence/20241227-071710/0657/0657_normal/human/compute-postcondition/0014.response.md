`p` is a list with the last element being even. The code appends to `p` the value of the last element plus 1. Since the last element of `p` is 2 (an even number), adding 1 to it results in 3. Therefore, `p` is updated to include 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is `[2, 1]`; `one` is unchanged and not equal to 0; `two` is its initial value - 1; `p` is `[2, 3]`.**
