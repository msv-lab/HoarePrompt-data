`s` is a list containing the value `[2]`. The code `s.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `s`. Therefore, the updated list `s` will now contain `[2, 1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()'; `s` is `[2, 1]`; `one` is unchanged; `two` is its initial value - 1; `p` is `[2]`; the last element of `p` is odd; `two` is not equal to 0**
