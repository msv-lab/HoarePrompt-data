`one` is decremented by 1. The value of `one` could previously be `one - 2` or `one - 1`, so after decrementing by 1, the new value of `one` would be `one - 3` or `one - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is either `[2, 1, 1, 1]`, `[2, 2, 1, 1]`, or `[2, 1, 1, 1]`, `one` is either `one - 3` or `one - 2`, `two` is either -2, -3, or -2, `p` is either `[2, 3, 4, 5]` or `[2, 4, 6, 7]` with the last element being odd, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is either `[2, 1, 1, 1]`, `[2, 2, 1, 1]`, or `[2, 1, 1, 1]`, `one` is either `one - 3` or `one - 2`, `two` is either -2, -3, or -2, `p` is either `[2, 3, 4, 5]` or `[2, 4, 6, 7]` with the last element being odd, `i` is 3**
