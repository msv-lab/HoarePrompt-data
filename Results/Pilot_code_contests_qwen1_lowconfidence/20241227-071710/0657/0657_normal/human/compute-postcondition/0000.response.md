The code `n = func_2()` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and no specific value for `n` is provided, the only change here is that `n` now holds the value returned by `func_2()`. The function `func_2()` could return any integer within the specified range, but without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2()`, we can only say that `n` is now the value returned by `func_2()`.

The list `l` remains unchanged as the code does not interact with it. The initial state of `l` being a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2 is preserved.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `l` is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2**
