Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The for loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`. This means that the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

2. **Determine the Minimum Value of `n` for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute even once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`).

3. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`l`, `s`, `one`, `two`, and `p`) are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Based on this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute.

### Final State Adjustment
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is `[2]`, `one` is unchanged, `two` is its initial value - 1, `p` is `[2]`**
