The code snippet `p.append(p[-1] + 1)` appends the value of the last element of `p` plus 1 to the list `p`. 

- In the initial state, `p` is either `[2, 3]` (last element is even) or `[2, 4]` (last element is odd).
- If `p` is `[2, 3]`, the new last element will be `3 + 1 = 4`.
- If `p` is `[2, 4]`, the new last element will be `4 + 1 = 5`.

The other variables (`n`, `l`, `s`, `one`, `two`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- If `p` was `[2, 3]`, it becomes `[2, 3, 4]`.
- If `p` was `[2, 4]`, it becomes `[2, 4, 5]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is either `[2, 1, 1]`, `[2, 2, 1]`, or `[2, 1, 1]`; `one` is either `one - 1` or unchanged; `two` is either -2 or its initial value -1; `p` is either `[2, 3, 4]` or `[2, 4, 5]`, with the last element of `p` being even in the if part and odd in the else part; `i` is 2.**
