`l` is reassigned to the value returned by `func_5()`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was assigned by `func_2()` previously. The exact values in `l` depend on what `func_5()` returns, but it is known that `l` is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `l` is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2, and `l` is reassigned to the value returned by `func_5()`**
