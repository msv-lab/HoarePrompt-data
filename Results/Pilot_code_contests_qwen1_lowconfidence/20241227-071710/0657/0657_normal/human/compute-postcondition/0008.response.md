The code assigns the value `[2]` to the variable `p`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, `s`, `one`, or `two`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is `[2]`, `one` is unchanged, `two` is unchanged, `p` is `[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is `[2]`, `one` is unchanged, `two` is unchanged, `p` is `[2]`**
