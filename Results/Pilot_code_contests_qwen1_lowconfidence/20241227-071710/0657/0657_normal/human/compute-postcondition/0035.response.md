`one` is decremented by 1. Since `one` was either `one - 1` or unchanged, after the operation, `one` will now be `one - 2`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is either `[2, 1, 1]`, `[2, 2, 1]`, or `[2, 1, 1]`, `one` is `one - 2`, `two` is either -2 or its initial value -1, `p` is `[2, 3, 4]`, `i` is 2.**
