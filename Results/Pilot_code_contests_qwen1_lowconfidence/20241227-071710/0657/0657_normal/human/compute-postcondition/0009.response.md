`two` is decremented by 1. The value of `n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, the list `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is `[2]`, `one` is unchanged, and `p` is `[2]`. After executing `two -= 1`, the value of `two` will be reduced by 1, but its initial value is not specified.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is `[2]`, `one` is unchanged, `two` is its initial value - 1, `p` is `[2]`**
