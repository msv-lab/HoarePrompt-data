`one` is decremented by 1. The initial state was that `one` is not equal to 0, so after decrementing, `one` will be equal to `one - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is `[2, 1]`; `one` is `one - 1`; `two` is its initial value - 1; `p` is `[2, 3]`.**
