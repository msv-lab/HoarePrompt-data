`p.append(p[-1] + 2)` appends to the list `p` the value of the last element plus 2. Given the precondition that `p` is either `[2, 3]` (if the last element was even) or `[2, 4]` (if the last element was odd), we can determine the new value of `p`:

- If `p` was `[2, 3]`, the last element is 3 (odd), so appending `3 + 2` results in `[2, 3, 5]`.
- If `p` was `[2, 4]`, the last element is 4 (even), so appending `4 + 2` results in `[2, 4, 6]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `p` will be either `[2, 3, 5]` or `[2, 4, 6]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is either `[2, 1, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2]`, or `[2, 1, 2]`; `one` is either `one - 1` or unchanged; `two` is either -2 or its initial value -1; `p` is either `[2, 3, 5]` or `[2, 4, 6]`, with the last element of `p` being 5 or 6; `i` is 2.**
