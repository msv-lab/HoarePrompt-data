The function `func_14` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2. Based on the given output cases, the function does not directly return any values but rather seems to process the list `l` in some way.

However, since no specific return values are mentioned, we can only describe the parameters accepted and the nature of the operation without inferring the return type from the provided information alone.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `l`, a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2.**
