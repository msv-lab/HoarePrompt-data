`two` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `two` is -1, so after decrementing by 1, `two` becomes -2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is `[2, 2]`, `one` is equal to 0, `two` is -2, `p` is `[2, 4]` and the last element of `p` is even.
