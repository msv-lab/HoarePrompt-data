`s` is a list that can be either `[2, 1, 1]`, `[2, 2, 1]`, or `[2, 1, 1]`. The code appends the value `2` to the list `s`. Therefore, the new value of `s` will be one of the following: `[2, 1, 1, 2]`, `[2, 2, 1, 2]`, or `[2, 1, 1, 2]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is either `[2, 1, 1, 2]`, `[2, 2, 1, 2]`, or `[2, 1, 1, 2]`; `one` is either `one - 2` or `one - 1`; `two` is either -2, -3, or -2; `p` is either `[2, 3, 4]` or `[2, 4, 6]` with the last element being even, or `[2, 3, 5]` or `[2, 4, 6]` with the last element being odd; `i` is 3**
