`p.append(p[-1] + 2)` appends a new element to the list `p`. The last element of `p` before this operation is either 4 (if the last element was 2) or 6 (if the last element was 4). Adding 2 to the last element results in appending either 6 or 8 to the list `p`.

The initial conditions state that `p` is either `[2, 3, 4]` or `[2, 4, 6]` with the last element being even, or `[2, 3, 5]` or `[2, 4, 6]` with the last element being odd.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `p` is `[2, 3, 4]`, the last element is 4, and adding 2 gives 6. So, `p` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 6]`.
2. If `p` is `[2, 4, 6]`, the last element is 6, and adding 2 gives 8. So, `p` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.

In both scenarios, the last element is even, and the length of `p` increases by one.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()'; `s` is either `[2, 1, 1, 2]`, `[2, 2, 1, 2]`, or `[2, 1, 1, 2]`; `one` is either `one - 2` or `one - 1`; `two` is either -2, -3, or -2; `p` is either `[2, 3, 4, 6]` or `[2, 4, 6, 8]` with the last element being even; `i` is 3**
