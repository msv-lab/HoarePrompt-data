`s` is a list that initially contains the value `[2]`. The code snippet appends the value `1` to the list `s`. Therefore, the updated list `s` will be `[2, 1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is `[2, 1]`; `one` is unchanged and not equal to 0; `two` is its initial value - 1; `p` is `[2]` with the last element being even.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is `[2, 1]`; `one` is unchanged and not equal to 0; `two` is its initial value - 1; `p` is `[2]` with the last element being even.**
