`s` is reassigned to be a list containing the single element `2`. The value of `n` is unchanged and is the value returned by `func_2()`. The value of `l` is unchanged and is the list returned by `func_5()`. The values of `one` and `two` are also unchanged as no operations affecting them are performed in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is `[2]`, `one` is unchanged, `two` is unchanged.**
