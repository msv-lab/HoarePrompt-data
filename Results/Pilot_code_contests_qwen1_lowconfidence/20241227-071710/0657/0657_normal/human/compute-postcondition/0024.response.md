The code appends the value of the last element in `p` plus 2 to `p`. The last element of `p` is 2 (an odd number), so the new element appended to `p` is `2 + 2 = 4`.

- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `l` is the list returned by `func_5()` (unchanged).
- `s` is `[2, 2]` (unchanged).
- `one` is unchanged (unchanged).
- The current value of `two` is -1 (unchanged).
- `p` was `[2]` and now it becomes `[2, 4]` because the last element is 2 and adding 2 to it gives 4.
- The condition that `two` is not equal to 0 remains true.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is `[2, 2]`; `one` is unchanged; the current value of `two` is -1; `p` is `[2, 4]`**
