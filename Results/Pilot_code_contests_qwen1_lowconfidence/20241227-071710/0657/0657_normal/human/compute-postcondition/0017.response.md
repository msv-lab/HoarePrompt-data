`s` is a list containing the value 2. The code `s.append(2)` appends the value 2 to the list `s`. Since `s` already contains the value 2, after appending another 2, the list `s` will contain `[2, 2]`.

The other variables (`n`, `l`, `one`, `two`, `p`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is `[2, 2]`, `one` is equal to 0, `two` is its initial value - 1, `p` is `[2]` and the last element of `p` is even.**
