The code `p.append(p[-1] + 2)` appends a new element to the list `p`. The last element of `p` is currently 2 (as given in the initial state). Adding 2 to this last element results in 4. Therefore, the new list `p` will have the elements `[2, 4]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is `[2, 2]`, `one` is equal to 0, `two` is its initial value -1, `p` is `[2, 4]` and the last element of `p` is even.**
