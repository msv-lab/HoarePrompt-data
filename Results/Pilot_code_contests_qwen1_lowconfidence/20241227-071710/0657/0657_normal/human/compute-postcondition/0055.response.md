Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`. Depending on whether `one` is not 0, `s` can be either `[2, 1, 1, 1]` or `[2, 1, 1, 2]`, `one` can be either `one - 3`, `one - 2`, or `one - 1`, `two` can be either -2, -3, or -4, `p` can be either `[2, 3, 4, 5]` or `[2, 4, 6, 7]` with the last element being odd, `[2, 3, 4, 6]` or `[2, 4, 6, 8]` with the last element being even, or `[2, 3, 5, 7]` with the last element being odd, and `i` is 3.***
