The value of `two` is decremented by 1. Initially, `two` is -1, so after executing `two -= 1`, the value of `two` becomes -2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()'; `s` is `[2, 2]`; `one` is unchanged; `two` is -2; `p` is `[2, 4]`.**
