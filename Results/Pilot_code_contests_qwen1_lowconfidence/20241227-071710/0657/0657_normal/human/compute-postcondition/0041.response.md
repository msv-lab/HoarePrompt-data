The code `p.append(p[-1] + 2)` appends to the list `p` the value of the last element plus 2. Given the initial conditions, `p` is either `[2, 3]` (if the condition was true) or `[2, 4]` (if the condition was false), and the last element of `p` is either even or odd accordingly.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `p` is `[2, 3]` (last element is odd):
   - The new value to append would be `3 + 2 = 5`.
   - So, `p` becomes `[2, 3, 5]`.

2. If `p` is `[2, 4]` (last element is even):
   - The new value to append would be `4 + 2 = 6`.
   - So, `p` becomes `[2, 4, 6]`.

In both cases, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is either `[2, 1, 2]`, `[2, 2, 2]`, or `[2, 1, 2]`; `one` is either `one - 1` or unchanged; `two` is either -2 or its initial value -1; `p` is either `[2, 3, 5]` or `[2, 4, 6]` with the last element being odd or even respectively; `i` is 2.**
