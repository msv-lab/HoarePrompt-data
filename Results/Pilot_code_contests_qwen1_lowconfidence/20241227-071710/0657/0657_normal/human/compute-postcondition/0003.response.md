The code initializes an empty list `s`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `l`, or the fact that `l` was reassigned to the value returned by `func_5()`. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `l` is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2, and `l` is reassigned to the value returned by `func_5()`; `s` is an empty list**
