`one` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `one` is not specified, but it could be `one - 1` or unchanged. Since `one -= 1` is used, it means `one` is decremented by 1 regardless of its initial state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()'; `s` is either `[2, 1, 1]`, `[2, 2, 1]`, or `[2, 1, 1]`; `one` is `one - 2` (since it was decremented by 1); `two` is either -2 or its initial value -1; `p` is either `[2, 3, 4]` or `[2, 4, 5]`, with the last element of `p` being even in the if part and odd in the else part; `i` is 2.**
