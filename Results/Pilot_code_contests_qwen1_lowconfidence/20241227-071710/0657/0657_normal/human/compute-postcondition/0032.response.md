Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`.
   - `s` is either `[2, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, or `[2, 1]` (repeated for clarity, likely a typo; we'll assume it is `[2, 1]`).
   - `one` is either `one - 1` or unchanged.
   - `two` is either -2 or its initial value -1.
   - `p` is either `[2, 3]` or `[2, 4]`, with the last element of `p` being even in the if part and odd in the else part.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

3. **State Adjustment:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `i` was one less than the current `n`. Therefore, if `n` is greater than 1, the loop starts at `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `2` (since it starts at `1`).
   - `n` remains the same as it is only decremented within the loop based on certain conditions, but here we are only considering the start of the next iteration.

5. **Modified States:**
   - `i` is now `2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it must still be greater than `1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`, `s` is either `[2, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, or `[2, 1]`, `one` is either `one - 1` or unchanged, `two` is either -2 or its initial value -1, `p` is either `[2, 3]` or `[2, 4]`, with the last element of `p` being even in the if part and odd in the else part, `i` is 2.**
