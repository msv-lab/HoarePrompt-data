The code appends the next odd number (since the last element of `p` is odd) to the list `p`. Given that the last element of `p` is odd, the new element appended will be the next odd number.

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is `[2, 1]`; `one` is unchanged; `two` is its initial value -1; `p` is `[2]`; the last element of `p` is odd; `two` is not equal to 0

Step-by-step Impact:
1. The last element of `p` is odd (2).
2. The next odd number after 2 is 3.
3. `p.append(3)` appends 3 to `p`.

Updated State:
- `p` now contains `[2, 3]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `l` is the list returned by `func_5()`; `s` is `[2, 1]`; `one` is unchanged; `two` is its initial value -1; `p` is `[2, 3]`; the last element of `p` is odd; `two` is not equal to 0**
