The function `func_4()` reads input from the standard input, consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n`, representing the number of number tiles in the bag, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers, each either 1 or 2, representing the values written on the tiles. The function returns a map object containing these integers. Potential edge cases include the possibility that the second line might not contain exactly `n` integers, or the integers might not be either 1 or 2. In such cases, the function will still attempt to parse the integers, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
