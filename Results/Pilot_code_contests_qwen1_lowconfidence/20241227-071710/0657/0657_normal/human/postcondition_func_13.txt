The function `func_14()` accepts no direct parameters but relies on values returned by `func_2()` and `func_5()`. It generates a list `s` of length `n` (where `n` is the result of `func_2()`), consisting of integers `1` and `2`. The list starts with `2` and alternates between `1` and `2` based on the counts of `1`s and `2`s in the list `l` (returned by `func_5()`). If the counts of `1`s and `2`s are equal, it fills `s` with alternating `1`s and `2`s starting from `2`. Otherwise, it uses the available `1`s and `2`s to fill `s` while maintaining the count of `1`s and `2`s. The function ensures that the list `p` is constructed such that each element is the sum of the previous element and either `1` or `2` based on the choice of `1` or `2` in `s`. Finally, the function calls `func_1(*s)` with the generated list `s`.
