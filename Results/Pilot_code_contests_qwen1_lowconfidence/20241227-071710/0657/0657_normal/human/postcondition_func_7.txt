The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list, and `num` is an integer either 1 or 2. The function returns a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element in the list is equal to `num`. This is achieved through a list comprehension that constructs the 2D list with the specified dimensions and fills it with the value `num`. The function handles the case where `n` or `m` could be zero, resulting in an empty 2D list. No other edge cases are explicitly mentioned, but the code itself does not handle scenarios where `num` is neither 1 nor 2, which would result in an incorrect behavior according to the annotations.
