The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which must be a tuple or list containing at least one element. The function returns the first element of `item`. The first element is expected to be of a type that can be compared and sorted (e.g., integer, float, string). If `item` is an empty tuple or list, the function will raise an `IndexError`. No additional actions are performed by the function beyond returning the first element.
