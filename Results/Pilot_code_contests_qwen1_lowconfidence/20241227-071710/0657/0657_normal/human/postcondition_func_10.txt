The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the binary representation of `n` consists only of the digits 1 and 2. It converts `n` into its binary representation, where each digit in the binary form is extracted and converted to an integer (either 1 or 2), and returns a list of these integers. The function handles the given constraints and ensures that the output list correctly represents the binary digits of `n`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned, but the function will work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range and binary constraints.
