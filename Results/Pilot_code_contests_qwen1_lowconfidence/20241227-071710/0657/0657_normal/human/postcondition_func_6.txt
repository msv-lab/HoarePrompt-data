The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers where each integer is either 1 or 2. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l`, using the `getKey` function as the sorting key. The returned list contains the same elements as `l`, but in ascending order based on the values returned by `getKey`. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If `l` contains only one element, the function returns a list with that single element. No other modifications are made to the original list `l`; it remains unchanged.
