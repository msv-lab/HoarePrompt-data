None of the variables in the function signature are provided in the code snippet. However, the function `func_4()` reads input from the standard input, which consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (the number of number tiles in the bag), and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the values written on the tiles (either 1 or 2).
