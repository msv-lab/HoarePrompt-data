`num2` is assigned the value of `nums[node2]`. Since `node2` is `node1 + 3`, the value of `num2` is updated to `nums[node1 + 3]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node1 + 3]`, `node2` is `node1 + 3`, and `n` is greater than `node1 + 3**
