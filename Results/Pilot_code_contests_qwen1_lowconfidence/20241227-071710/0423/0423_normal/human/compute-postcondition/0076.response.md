The code `print(max_)` simply prints the value of `max_`. It does not change the value of `max_` or any other variable. Therefore, the value of `max_` remains unchanged, and the only difference is that its value is printed.

Output State: **`node` is a value in the range `[0, n-1]`, `n` is known and valid, `len_` is the length of the longest path starting from `node` in the graph, `lens` is a list where `lens[node]` is the length of the longest path starting from `node`, `max_` is the maximum length of any path found in the graph, and the value of `max_` is printed.**
