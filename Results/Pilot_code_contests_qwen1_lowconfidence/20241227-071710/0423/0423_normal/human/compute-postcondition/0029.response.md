The code appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. Initially, `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, and `graph` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `graph[node2]` will include `node1`.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, and `graph[node2]` includes `node1`.**
