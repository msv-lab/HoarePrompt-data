According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `node1`, `node2`, and `n`.

Before the loop starts, we know the following:
- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `node2` should be in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n - 1`.
2. `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1` to ensure there are values in the range to iterate over.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the initial state as follows:

- Ensure `n` is greater than `node1 + 1`.
- Set `node2` to `node1 + 1` initially since the loop will start iterating from this value.

Therefore, the state adjustments required are:

State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `node2` is `node1 + 1`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`**
