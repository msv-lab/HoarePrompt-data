Postcondition: ***`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is `nums[node2]`, `node2` is `node1 + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `node2`. If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, then graph[node2] contains node1 as an additional element. If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is greater than `k`, no additional action is taken.***
