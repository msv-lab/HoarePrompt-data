Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`
   - `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`
   - `node2` is `node1 + 2`
   - `n` is greater than `node2`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `node2` starting from `node1 + 1` up to but not including `n`.
   - At each iteration, it checks if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` (where `num2 = nums[node2]`) is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If the condition is met, `graph[node2]` includes `node1`.

4. **Analyzing the Current State:**
   - `node2` is currently `node1 + 2`.
   - Since the loop increments `node2` by 1, the next value of `node2` would be `node1 + 3`.

5. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` must still be greater than the new `node2` value, which is `node1 + 3`.
   - The values of `num1` and `num2` remain the same unless the loop body modifies them, but since the problem statement does not mention any modification, we assume they stay as `nums[node1]` and `nums[node1 + 3]` respectively.

6. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - `node2` will be incremented to `node1 + 3`.
   - `n` must be greater than `node1 + 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node1 + 3]`, `node2` is `node1 + 3`, and `n` is greater than `node1 + 3`**.
