The code appends the value of `len_` to the list `lens`. The initial state is provided as follows:

- `node` is 2
- `len_` is either 1, 5, or 8
- `lens` is a list with three elements where the second and third elements are the same and equal to `len_`
- `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4

If `len(graph[node]) == 0`, then `len_` is 1. Otherwise, `len_` is updated to `max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]) + 1`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Determine the value of `len_`:
   - If `len(graph[node]) == 0`, then `len_` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `len_` is updated to `max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]) + 1`.

Since the exact structure of `graph` is not given, we will consider both scenarios for `len_`.

### Scenario 1: `len(graph[node]) == 0`
In this case, `len_` is 1.

### Scenario 2: `len(graph[node]) != 0`
In this case, `len_` is updated to `max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]) + 1`. Since the elements of `lens` are all equal to `len_`, the maximum value of `lens` is `len_` itself. Thus, `len_` becomes `len_ + 1`.

Let's assume `len(graph[node]) != 0` for this example (the reasoning for `len(graph[node]) == 0` would follow similarly):

- Suppose `lens` is `[a, b, b]` where `b = len_`. Then `max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]])` is `len_` because all elements are `len_`.
- Therefore, `len_` becomes `len_ + 1`.

Given `len_` can be 1, 5, or 8, let's take the general case:

- If `len_` is 1, then it becomes 2.
- If `len_` is 5, then it becomes 6.
- If `len_` is 8, then it becomes 9.

Since `lens.append(len_)` appends the new value of `len_` to the list `lens`, the list `lens` will have one more element which is the new value of `len_`.

Output State: **`node` is 2; `len_` is either 2, 6, or 9; `lens` is a list with four elements where the second and third elements are the same and equal to `len_`; `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4.**
