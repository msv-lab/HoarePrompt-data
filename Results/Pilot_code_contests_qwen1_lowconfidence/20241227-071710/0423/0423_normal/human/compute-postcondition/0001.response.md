The code `n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))` reads two space-separated integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the input is not provided, the values of `n` and `k` are now specific integers within the given constraints, but their exact values are not known. However, we can state that they are integers between 1 and 300,000 inclusive.

The sequence `A` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it or access its elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 300,000; the sequence `A` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `A_i` ≤ 300,000 for each `i` in range 1 to `n`.**
