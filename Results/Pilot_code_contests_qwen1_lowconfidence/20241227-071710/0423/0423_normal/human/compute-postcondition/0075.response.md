Output State: **`node` is a value in the range `[0, n-1]`, `n` is known and valid, `len_` is the length of the longest path starting from `node` in the graph, `lens` is a list where `lens[node]` is the length of the longest path starting from `node`, `max_` is the maximum length of any path found in the graph.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `num1` is the original value of `nums[node1]`.
   - `node1` is the original value of `node1`.
   - `nums` is in its original state.
   - `graph` is constructed based on the condition `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k`.
   - `lens` is an empty list.
   - `max_` is 0.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each node in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - For each node, `len_` is calculated as either 1 (if the node has no children) or the maximum length of paths from its children plus 1.
   - This value is appended to `lens`.
   - `max_` is updated to be the maximum of the current `len_` and the previous `max_`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all nodes have been processed, `lens` will contain the length of the longest path starting from each node.
   - `max_` will contain the maximum length of any path found in the graph.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the graph is empty or no nodes satisfy the condition to form a path, `max_` will remain 0.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, `node` will be a value within the valid range, `n` will be unchanged, `len_` will be the length of the longest path starting from `node`, `lens` will store these lengths for each node, and `max_` will be the maximum path length found in the graph.
