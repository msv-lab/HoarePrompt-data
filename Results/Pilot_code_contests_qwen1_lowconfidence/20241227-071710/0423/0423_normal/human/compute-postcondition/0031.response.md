According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `node2`. The loop iterates over all nodes from `node1 + 1` to `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states were true:
- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`
- `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`
- `graph` remains unchanged

For the loop to execute one more time, `node2` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `num1` will still be equal to `nums[node1]`
- `num2` will now be equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`
- `graph` will remain unchanged

The loop will continue as long as `node2` is less than `n`.

State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`, and `graph` remains unchanged.**
