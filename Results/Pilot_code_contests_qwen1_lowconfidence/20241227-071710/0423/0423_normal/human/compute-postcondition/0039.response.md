The code assigns the value of `nums[node2]` to the variable `num2`. The previous value of `num2` was undefined, but now it is assigned the value of `nums[node2]`. The state of `nums` and `node2` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num2` is `nums[node2]`, `nums` is in its original state, `node2` is in its original state**
