Let's analyze the loop and determine the output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`
- No other variables are initialized in the loop.

### Loop Code
```python
for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
    num2 = nums[node2]
    if abs(num1 - num2) <= k:
        graph[node2].append(node1)
```

### Analysis

1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than `node1`.

2. **Variable Values After Each Iteration**:
   - `num1` remains constant as it is initialized before the loop and does not change inside the loop.
   - `num2` changes with each iteration as it is set to `nums[node2]`.
   - `node2` increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - `graph[node2]` may or may not contain `node1` based on the condition `abs(num1 - num2) <= k`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `node2` will be `n-1` (assuming the loop runs until the last possible value).
   - `num1` will still be `nums[node1]`.
   - `num2` will be `nums[n-1]` (if the loop runs to completion).
   - For each `node2` where `abs(num1 - num2) <= k`, `node1` will be added to `graph[node2]`.

4. **General Case**:
   - If the loop does not run at all (i.e., `n <= node1`), then `num1` remains `nums[node1]`, and `graph` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion
- The loop will add `node1` to `graph[node2]` for every `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]` where the condition `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k` holds true.
- If the loop does not execute, `graph` remains unchanged, and `num1` remains `nums[node1]`.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `graph` is updated such that for each `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]` where `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, `node1` is appended to `graph[node2]`. If the loop does not execute, `num1` remains `nums[node1]` and `graph` remains unchanged.**
