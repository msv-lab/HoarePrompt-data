The code updates the variable `max_` to be the maximum of `len_` and `max_`. Since `max_` is initially undefined (or considered as 0 in this context), it will be updated to the value of `len_`.

- `node` remains unchanged and is 0.
- `n` remains unchanged and is known and valid.
- `len_` remains unchanged and is either 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is 0) or the maximum length among the children of `node` incremented by 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is not 0).
- `lens` remains unchanged and is a list with one additional element, which is the value of `len_`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `node` is 0, `n` is known and valid, `len_` is either 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is 0) or the maximum length among the children of `node` incremented by 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is not 0), `lens` is a list with one additional element, which is the value of `len_`; `max_` is the value of `len_`.

Output State: **`node` is 0, `n` is known and valid, `len_` is either 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is 0) or the maximum length among the children of `node` incremented by 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is not 0), `lens` is a list with one additional element, which is the value of `len_`; `max_` is the value of `len_`.**
