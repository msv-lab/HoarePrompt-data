`lens.append(len_)` appends the value of `len_` to the list `lens`. The value of `len_` depends on the length of `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` is empty, `len_` is 1. Otherwise, `len_` is the maximum length among the children of `node` incremented by 1. The variables `node`, `n`, and `graph` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is 0, `n` is known and valid, `len_` is either 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is 0) or `len_` is the maximum length among the children of `node` incremented by 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is not 0); `lens` is a list with one additional element, which is the value of `len_`.**
