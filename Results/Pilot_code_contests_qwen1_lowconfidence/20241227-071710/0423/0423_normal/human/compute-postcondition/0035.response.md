Let's analyze the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State
- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`.
- `graph` remains unchanged.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `node2` from `node1 + 1` to `n-1` and checks if the absolute difference between `num1` and `nums[node2]` is less than or equal to `k`. If this condition is met, `node1` is appended to `graph[node2]`.

### Key Points to Consider
- The loop will iterate `n - node1 - 1` times, as it starts from `node1 + 1` and goes up to `n-1`.
- After the loop, `num1` will still be equal to `nums[node1]` because the loop does not modify `num1`.
- `graph` will be updated based on the condition in the loop.

### Final Output State
After the loop completes all its iterations, for each `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]`, if the condition `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k` was met, `node1` will be appended to `graph[node2]`.

Thus, the final state of the variables will be:

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `graph` contains all nodes `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]` such that `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k`, and `graph` remains unchanged otherwise.**

This means that after the loop has finished executing, `graph` will contain a list of all nodes `node2` (in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]`) for which the condition `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k` holds true.
