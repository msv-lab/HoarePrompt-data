The code initializes an empty list `lens`. This does not affect the values of `num1`, `node1`, `nums`, or `graph`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `lens` list.

Output State: **`num1` is the original value of `nums[node1]`, `node1` is the original value of `node1`, `nums` is in its original state, `graph` is a list of lists where for each `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]` and for every pair `(node1, node2)` where `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k`, `node1` is appended to `graph[node2]`, and `lens` is an empty list.**
