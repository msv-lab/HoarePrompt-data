The code `graph[node2].append(node1)` appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. Given the initial state:

- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`
- `num2` is equal to `nums[node1 + 3]`
- `node2` is `node1 + 3`
- `n` is greater than `node1 + 3`

After executing the code, `graph[node2]` will have `node1` appended to it. The values of `num1`, `num2`, `node2`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node1 + 3]`, `node2` is `node1 + 3`, and `n` is greater than `node1 + 3`; `graph[node2]` contains `[node1]`**
