The code creates a list of empty lists, where the length of the outer list is `n`. Each inner list is initialized as an empty list. This does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `A`, or `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 300,000; the sequence `A` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `A_i` ≤ 300,000 for each `i` in range 1 to `n`; `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from input and converted to integers; `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists**
