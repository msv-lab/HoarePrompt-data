`graph[node2].append(node1)` appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. Based on the initial state, `node2` is updated to `node2 + 2`, and `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`. The output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`num2` is `nums[node2]` where `node2` is `node2 + 2`; `node2` is `node2 + 2`; `nums` is in its original state; `graph[node2]` now includes `node1`**
