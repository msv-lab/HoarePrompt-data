The code appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. Given the initial conditions, `node2` starts from `node1 + 1`, and the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.

- `num1` remains equal to `nums[node1]`.
- `num2` remains equal to `nums[node2]`.
- The graph structure changes such that `node1` is appended to the list at `graph[node2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `graph` remains unchanged except for the addition of `node1` to `graph[node2]`, `node2` starts from `node1 + 1`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, and the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
