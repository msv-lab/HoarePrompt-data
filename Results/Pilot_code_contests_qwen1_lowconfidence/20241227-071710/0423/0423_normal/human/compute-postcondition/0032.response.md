The code updates `num2` to be equal to `nums[node2]`. The initial state was `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`, and `graph` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `num2` is now updated to `nums[node2]`.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, and `graph` remains unchanged.**
