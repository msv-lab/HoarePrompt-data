The code `nums = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]` creates a list `nums` by reading `n` integers from input and converting them to integers. This operation affects the variable `nums` while `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Since the exact values of the input integers are not known, we will represent them generically.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 300,000; `k` is an integer between 1 and 300,000; the sequence `A` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `A_i` ≤ 300,000 for each `i` in range 1 to `n`; `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from input and converted to integers.**
