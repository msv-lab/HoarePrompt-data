Postcondition: ***`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, and `graph` remains unchanged. If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `num2` is contained in `graph[node2]` and `graph[node2]` includes `num1`. Otherwise, the condition remains as initially stated.***
