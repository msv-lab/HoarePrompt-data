According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `node2`. The loop iterates over the range from `node1 + 1` to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `num2` is `nums[node2]`
- `nums` is in its original state
- `node2` is in its original state
- `graph[node2]` is `[num2, node1]`
- The absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`

For the loop to execute one more time, `node2` must be incremented and must still be within the range `node1 + 1` to `n`.

Given that `node2` was at the end of the last iteration, let's assume it was `node2_end`. For the loop to continue, `node2_end + 1` must be within the range `node1 + 1` to `n`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- `num2` will be `nums[node2 + 1]` (assuming the next valid value for `node2` is `node2 + 1`)
- `node2` will be `node2 + 1`
- `graph[node2]` will be `[num2, node1]` (with `node2` updated)

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num2` is `nums[node2 + 1]`, `nums` is in its original state, `node2` is `node2 + 1`, `graph[node2]` is `[num2, node1]`**
