The line `max_ = 0` initializes the variable `max_` to 0. This does not affect the values of `num1`, `node1`, `nums`, `graph`, or `lens`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `max_` being set to 0.

Output State: **`num1` is the original value of `nums[node1]`, `node1` is the original value of `node1`, `nums` is in its original state, `graph` is a list of lists where for each `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]` and for every pair `(node1, node2)` where `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k`, `node1` is appended to `graph[node2]`, `lens` is an empty list, and `max_` is 0.**
