To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the information provided and analyze what the loop requires:

1. **Variables and their initial states:**
   - `num1`: The original value of `nums[node1]`.
   - `node1`: The original value of `node1`.
   - `nums`: In its original state.
   - `graph`: A list of lists where for each `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]` and for every pair `(node1, node2)` where `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k`, `node1` is appended to `graph[node2]`.
   - `lens`: An empty list.
   - `max_`: 0.

2. **Loop analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `node` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **What the loop needs:**
   - For the loop to execute, `node` must have valid values within the specified range. Specifically, `node` should iterate through all indices from `0` to `n-1`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop variable `node` is set up correctly to start iterating over the range `[0, n-1]`. Hereâ€™s the state that needs to be adjusted:

- `node` must be initialized to 0.
- The loop will continue as long as `node < n`.

Therefore, the state to adjust is:

State: **`node` is 0, `n` is known and valid**.

This ensures that the loop will start executing with `node` initialized to 0 and will continue until `node` reaches `n-1`.
