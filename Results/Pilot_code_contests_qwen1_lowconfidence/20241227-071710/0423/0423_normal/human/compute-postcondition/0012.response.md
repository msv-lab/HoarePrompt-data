`num2` is reassigned the value of `nums[node2]`. The previous value of `num2` was `nums[node1 + 2]`, so now `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `node2` (i.e., `node1 + 2`).**
