Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`.
   - `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`.
   - `graph` remains unchanged (except possibly for the addition of `node1` to `graph[node2]`).
   - The condition for adding `node1` to `graph[node2]` is if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `node2` from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.

3. **Key Variables and Their Changes:**
   - `num1` remains unchanged as it is based on `nums[node1]`.
   - `num2` changes to `nums[node2]` for each new iteration of the loop.
   - `graph` may change if the condition is met, but we are focusing on the states before the condition is checked.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition to add `node1` to `graph[node2]` is `abs(num1 - num2) <= k`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `node2` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `num2` will now be `nums[node2 + 1]` (since `node2` starts from `node1 + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration).

6. **Final States:**
   - `num1` remains `nums[node1]`.
   - `num2` becomes `nums[node2 + 1]`.
   - `graph` remains unchanged until the condition is checked.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2 + 1]`, and `graph` remains unchanged.**
