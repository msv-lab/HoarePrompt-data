The given code snippet is defining an input function using `lambda` and `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`. This does not assign any values to variables or change any existing values; it simply defines a new way to read input from the standard input stream. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **N and K are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 300,000 and 0 ≤ K ≤ 300,000; the sequence A is a list of N integers where 0 ≤ A_i ≤ 300,000 for each i in range 1 to N.**
