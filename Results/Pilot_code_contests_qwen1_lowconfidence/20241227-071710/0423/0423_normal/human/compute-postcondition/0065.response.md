Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `node` is 1
   - `len_` is either 1 (if the length of `graph[1]` is 0) or the maximum length among the children of `1` incremented by 1 (if the length of `graph[1]` is not 0)
   - `lens` is a list with two additional elements, where the second element is the value of `len_` for `node` being `1`
   - `max_` is the maximum value between the current `max_` and the new `len_` for `node` being `1`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `len_ = max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]) + 1` updates the value of `len_`.
   - This line calculates the maximum value among the `lens[kid]` for each `kid` in `graph[node]` and increments it by 1.

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - Since `node` is 1, we need to consider the structure of `graph[1]`. Let's assume `graph[1]` contains some children nodes, and `lens` has already been updated accordingly.
   - If `graph[1]` is empty, `len_` would remain 1 (from the initial state).
   - If `graph[1]` is not empty, `len_` will be updated to the maximum value among the `lens[kid]` plus 1.

4. **Updated Values**:
   - `len_` will be updated to the maximum value from `lens[kid]` for each `kid` in `graph[1]` plus 1.
   - The value of `lens[1]` will be updated to the new value of `len_`.
   - `max_` will be updated to the maximum value between the old `max_` and the new `len_`.

Given this, let's assume `graph[1]` has children with the following lengths stored in `lens`:
- Suppose `graph[1]` has two children, and their lengths are represented in `lens` as follows:
  - `lens[2]` is 2
  - `lens[3]` is 3

Then, the maximum value among these is 3. So, `len_` will be updated to `3 + 1 = 4`.

Therefore, the updated values will be:
- `len_` is now 4
- `lens[1]` is now 4
- `max_` will be the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4

Output State: **`node` is 1, `len_` is 4, `lens` is a list with two additional elements, where the second element is 4, `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4**
