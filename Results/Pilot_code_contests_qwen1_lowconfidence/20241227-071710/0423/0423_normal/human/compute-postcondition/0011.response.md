According to the code, the loop iterates over `node2` starting from `node1 + 1` up to `n`. The loop body depends on the conditions involving `num1`, `num2`, and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`
- `num2` is `nums[node2]`
- `node2` is `node1 + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `node2`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `node2` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value (`node1 + 1`).
- `num2` must be updated to `nums[node2]`, where `node2` is now `node1 + 2`.
- `n` must still be greater than `node2`.

Let's summarize these changes:

- `node2` becomes `node1 + 2`.
- `num2` becomes `nums[node1 + 2]`.
- `n` must still be greater than `node2` (i.e., `node1 + 2`).

Therefore, the new state is:
State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is `nums[node1 + 2]`, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `node2` (i.e., `node1 + 2`).**
