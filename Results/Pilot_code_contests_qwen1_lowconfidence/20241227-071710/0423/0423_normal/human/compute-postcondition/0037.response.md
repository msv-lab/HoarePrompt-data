`num1` is assigned the value of `nums[node1]`. The value of `node1` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `num1` without knowing `node1`. However, we know that `num1` was previously equal to `nums[n-2]`. Since the code assigns `nums[node1]` to `num1`, `num1` now holds the value of `nums[node1]`.

The conditions for `graph` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not affect `graph`.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `graph` contains nodes in the range `[n-1, n-1]` that satisfy the condition, and `graph` remains unchanged otherwise.**
