`num2` is assigned the value of `nums[node2]`. The value of `num1` remains `nums[node1]`, `graph` remains unchanged, and `node2` starts from `node1 + 1`. There must be at least one valid `node2` in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`. Therefore, `num2` is now a specific value from the `nums` list at index `node2`.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `graph` remains unchanged, `node2` starts from `node1 + 1`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`**
