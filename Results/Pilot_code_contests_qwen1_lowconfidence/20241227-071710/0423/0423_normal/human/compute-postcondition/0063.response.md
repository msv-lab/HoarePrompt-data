Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `node` is 0
   - `n` is known and valid
   - `len_` is either 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is 0) or the maximum length among the children of `node` incremented by 1 (if the length of `graph[node]` is not 0)
   - `lens` is a list with one additional element, which is the value of `len_`
   - `max_` is the value of `len_`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for node in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over nodes from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `node` was `0`, meaning the loop has just completed its first iteration.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `node` must be incremented to `1`.
   - Since `lens` and `max_` were updated based on the processing of `node` being `0`, these values need to be adjusted for `node` now being `1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `node` will become `1` in the next iteration.
   - `len_` will be recalculated based on the graph structure for `node` being `1`.
   - `lens` will have an additional element corresponding to the new `len_` for `node` being `1`.
   - `max_` will be updated if the new `len_` for `node` being `1` is greater than the current `max_`.

6. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `node` is 1
   - `len_` is either 1 (if the length of `graph[1]` is 0) or the maximum length among the children of `1` incremented by 1 (if the length of `graph[1]` is not 0)
   - `lens` is a list with two additional elements, where the second element is the value of `len_` for `node` being `1`
   - `max_` is the maximum value between the current `max_` and the new `len_` for `node` being `1`

State: **`node` is 1, `len_` is either 1 (if the length of `graph[1]` is 0) or the maximum length among the children of `1` incremented by 1 (if the length of `graph[1]` is not 0), `lens` is a list with two additional elements, where the second element is the value of `len_` for `node` being `1`, `max_` is the maximum value between the current `max_` and the new `len_` for `node` being `1`**
