Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`.
- `graph` contains all nodes `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]` such that `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k`.
- The graph remains unchanged otherwise.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for node1 in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `node1` from `0` to `n-2` (since `range(n-1)` generates values from `0` to `n-2`).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `node1` is one value lower than it was at the beginning of that iteration.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - If `node1` is currently `n-2`, then the loop will stop because `range(n-1)` does not include `n-1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `node1` must be `n-3`.

### Adjusted States:
- Since the loop will increment `node1` by 1, the new `node1` value will be `n-2` for the next iteration.
- `num1` will be updated to `nums[n-2]` (assuming `node1` changes to `n-2`).
- The condition for `graph` remains the same, as the graph does not change during the loop iterations based on the given information.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[n-2]`, `graph` contains all nodes `node2` in the range `[n-2 + 1, n-1]` such that `abs(nums[n-2] - nums[node2]) <= k`, and `graph` remains unchanged otherwise.**

In simpler terms:
State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[n-2]`, `graph` contains nodes in the range `[n-1, n-1]` that satisfy the condition, and `graph` remains unchanged otherwise.**
