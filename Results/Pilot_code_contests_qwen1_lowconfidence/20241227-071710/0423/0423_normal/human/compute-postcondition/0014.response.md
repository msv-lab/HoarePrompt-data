Postcondition: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, and `n` is greater than `node2`. If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `graph[node2]` includes `node1`. Otherwise, no change is made to the graph.**
