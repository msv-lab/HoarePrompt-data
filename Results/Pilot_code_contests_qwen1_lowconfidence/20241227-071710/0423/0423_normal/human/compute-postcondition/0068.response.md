The code updates the value of `max_` to be the maximum between `len_` and the current value of `max_`. Given that `len_` is either 1 or 4, and `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and the new `len_` for `node` being 1, let's consider both cases:

1. If `len_` is 1, the new `max_` will be the maximum between 1 and the old `max_`.
2. If `len_` is 4, the new `max_` will be the maximum between 4 and the old `max_`.

Let's break it down:

- If `len_` is 1:
  - The old `max_` could be 1 (if `len_` was 1 before) or 4 (if `len_` was 4 before).
  - The new `max_` will be 1 because the maximum between 1 and 1 is 1, and the maximum between 1 and 4 is 4.
- If `len_` is 4:
  - The old `max_` could be 1 (if `len_` was 1 before) or 4 (if `len_` was 4 before).
  - The new `max_` will be 4 because the maximum between 4 and 1 is 4, and the maximum between 4 and 4 is 4.

Therefore, the value of `max_` will be either 1 or 4, depending on the initial value of `max_` and the current value of `len_`.

Output State: **`node` is 1, `len_` is either 1 or 4, `lens` is a list with three elements where the second and third elements are the same and equal to `len_`, and `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4.**
