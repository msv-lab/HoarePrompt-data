The code appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. This means that `graph[node2]` now contains `num2` (which is `nums[node2]`) and `node1`. The absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` being less than or equal to `k` is a condition mentioned in the initial state, but it does not get directly modified by the given code.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated list in `graph[node2]` and retain the initial conditions about `num2`, `nums`, `node2`, and the absolute difference condition.

Output State: **`num2` is `nums[node2]`, `nums` is in its original state, `node2` is in its original state, `graph[node2]` is `[num2, node1]`, the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`**
