The code `len_ = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `len_`. This changes the value of `len_` from its previous state, which was either `1` if the length of `graph[1]` is `0` or the maximum length among the children of `1` incremented by `1` if the length of `graph[1]` is not `0`. After this assignment, `len_` is explicitly set to `1`.

Other variables are not affected. The variable `node` remains `1`, `lens` remains a list with two additional elements, where the second element is the value of `len_` for `node` being `1`, and `max_` remains the maximum value between the current `max_` and the new `len_` for `node` being `1`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `len_` is now `1`.
- The second element of `lens` is now `1`.
- `max_` is the maximum value between the current `max_` and `1`.

Output State: **`node` is 1, `len_` is 1, `lens` is a list with two additional elements, where the second element is 1, `max_` is the maximum value between the current `max_` and 1**
