`graph[node2]` is appended with `node1`. The initial value of `graph[node2]` is `[num2, node1]`, so after appending `node1`, it becomes `[num2, node1, node1]`.

Output State: **`num2` is `nums[node2]`, `nums` is in its original state, `node2` is `node2 + 1`, `graph[node2]` is `[num2, node1, node1]`**
