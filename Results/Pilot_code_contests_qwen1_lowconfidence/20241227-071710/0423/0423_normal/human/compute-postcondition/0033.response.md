The code appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. The values of `num1` and `num2` remain unchanged, and `graph` is modified by adding `node1` to the list at index `node2`.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, and `graph[node2]` contains `num2` and `node1`.**
