The code snippet calculates `len_` using the maximum length of the `lens` values of the `kids` (nodes connected to `node`) in the `graph`, and then adds 1 to this maximum value. Since the initial value of `node` is 0, `n` is known and valid, and the length of `graph[node]` is not 0, the variable `len_` will be assigned a specific value based on the `lens` values of the kids.

Let's denote the kids of `node` as `kid1, kid2, ..., kid_m` where `m` is the number of kids. Each `kid_i` has an associated `lens[kid_i]` value. The value of `len_` will be:

\[ len_ = \max(\text{lens}[kid1], \text{lens}[kid2], \ldots, \text{lens}[kid_m]) + 1 \]

Since the exact values of `lens[kid_i]` are not provided, we express `len_` in terms of these values. The output state will reflect the assignment of `len_` and the unchanged values of `node` and `n`.

Output State: **`node` is 0, `n` is known and valid, `len_` is \(\max(\text{lens}[kid1], \text{lens}[kid2], \ldots, \text{lens}[kid_m]) + 1\)**
