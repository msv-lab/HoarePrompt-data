The code `graph[node2].append(node1)` appends `node1` to the list `graph[node2]`. Given the initial state, this operation does not change the values of `num1`, `node2`, `num2`, or `n`. The condition about the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` being less than or equal to `k` remains valid.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `node2` is `node1 + 1`, `num2` is `nums[node2]`, `n` must be greater than `node2`, and the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`; graph[node2] contains node1 as an additional element.**
