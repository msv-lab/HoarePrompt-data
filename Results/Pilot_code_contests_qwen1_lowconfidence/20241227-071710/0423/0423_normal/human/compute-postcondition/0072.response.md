Postcondition: ***`node` is 2, `len_` is either 1, 5, or 8, `lens` is a list with three elements where the second and third elements are the same and equal to `len_`, and `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4. If `len(graph[node]) == 0`, then `len_` is 1. Otherwise, `len_` is updated to `max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]) + 1`***
