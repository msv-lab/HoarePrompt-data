To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider how the loop variable `node1` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `node1 = 0` to `node1 = n - 2`.
2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`.
   - `graph` is updated according to the condition `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k` for each `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]`.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `node1` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `node1` at the start of the next iteration will be `node1 + 1`.
   - Consequently, `num1` will now be `nums[node1 + 1]`.

Given the above analysis, for the loop to execute one more time, `node1` should be `node1 + 1` (i.e., `node1 + 1`), and `num1` should be `nums[node1 + 1]`.

### Final State:

- `num1` is `nums[node1 + 1]`.
- `graph` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`num1` is equal to `nums[node1 + 1]`, `graph` remains unchanged.**

### Final Answer:
State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1 + 1]`, `graph` remains unchanged.**
