The code sets the variable `len_` to 1. This does not affect the values of `node` or `n`, nor does it change the length of `graph[node]`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `len_`.

Output State: **`node` is 0, `n` is known and valid, the length of `graph[node]` is 0, `len_` is 1**
