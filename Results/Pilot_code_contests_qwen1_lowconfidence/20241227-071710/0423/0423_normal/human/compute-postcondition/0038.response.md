Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `node2` in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n`.
   - This means the loop will execute as long as there are nodes in the range `[node1 + 1, n)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions**:
   - `num1` is initially set to `nums[node1]`.
   - `graph` contains nodes in the range `[n-1, n-1]` that satisfy a certain condition.
   - `graph` remains unchanged otherwise.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one node in the range `[node1 + 1, n)`.
   - Since `graph` only contains nodes in the range `[n-1, n-1]` that satisfy a condition, we need to ensure that there are no such nodes in this specific range for the loop to execute properly.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that there are no nodes in the range `[node1 + 1, n)` to avoid the loop executing unnecessarily.
   - Since `graph` contains nodes that satisfy a condition, if there are no such nodes in the specified range, the loop won't execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num1` should still be equal to `nums[node1]`.
- `graph` should contain nodes in the range `[n-1, n-1]` that satisfy the condition, but importantly, these nodes should not be in the range `[node1 + 1, n)`.

**Final State:**
State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `graph` contains nodes in the range `[n-1, n-1]` that satisfy the condition, and none of these nodes are in the range `[node1 + 1, n)`**
