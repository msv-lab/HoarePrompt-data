Postcondition: ***`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, and `graph` remains unchanged (except possibly for the addition of `node1` to `graph[node2]`). If the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `node1` is added to `graph[node2]`. Otherwise, the graph remains unchanged.***
