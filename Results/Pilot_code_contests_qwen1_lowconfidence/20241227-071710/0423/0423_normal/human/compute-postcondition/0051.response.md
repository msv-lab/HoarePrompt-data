Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`.
- `graph` contains nodes in the range `[n-1, n-1]` that satisfy the condition, and `graph` remains unchanged otherwise.
- `nums` is in its original state.
- `node1` is in its original state.

### Loop Code:
```python
for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
    num2 = nums[node2]
    if abs(num1 - num2) <= k:
        graph[node2].append(node1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `num1` starts with the value of `nums[node1]`.
   - `graph` initially contains nodes in the range `[n-1, n-1]` that satisfy the condition, and remains unchanged otherwise.
   - `nums` remains unchanged.
   - `node1` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `node2` in the range `(node1 + 1, n)`, the loop checks if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` (where `num2 = nums[node2]`) is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If the condition is met, `node1` is appended to `graph[node2]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes executing, `node1` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `graph[node2]` for valid `node2` values.
   - `num1` also remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `num1`.
   - `graph` will have updated entries based on the loop's conditions. Specifically, for each `node2` such that `abs(num1 - num2) <= k`, `node1` will be appended to `graph[node2]`.

### Conclusion:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the values of `node1` and `num1` remain unchanged. The `graph` will have been modified based on the conditions specified in the loop.

### Output State:
Output State: **`num1` is the original value of `nums[node1]`, `node1` is the original value of `node1`, `nums` is in its original state, and for each `node2` such that `abs(num1 - nums[node2]) <= k`, `graph[node2]` contains `node1`.**
