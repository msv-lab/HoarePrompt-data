Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num2` is `nums[node2]`
   - `nums` is in its original state
   - `node2` is `node2 + 1`
   - The condition to update `graph[node2]` is if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `node2` in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n`.

3. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `node2` was `node2 + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `node2` needs to be incremented by 1 again.
   - Therefore, `node2` will now be `node2 + 2`.
   - The other variables (`num2`, `nums`, and the condition check) remain unchanged as long as the loop condition is satisfied.

4. **Loop Condition Check**:
   - The loop continues as long as `node2 < n`.
   - If the condition for updating `graph[node2]` is met (i.e., `abs(num1 - num2) <= k`), then `graph[node2]` is updated accordingly.

Given these points, we can adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop.

**State:**
- `num2` is `nums[node2]`
- `nums` is in its original state
- `node2` is `node2 + 2`
- The condition to update `graph[node2]` is if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`num2` is `nums[node2]`, `nums` is in its original state, `node2` is `node2 + 2`, and the condition to update `graph[node2]` is if the absolute difference between `num1` and `num2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
