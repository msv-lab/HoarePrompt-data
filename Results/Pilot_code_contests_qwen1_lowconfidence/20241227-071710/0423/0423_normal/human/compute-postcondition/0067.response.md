The code appends the value of `len_` to the list `lens`. Given the initial state, `len_` is either 1 or 4, and the second element of `lens` is already set to the appropriate value of `len_` for `node` being 1 (which means `lens[1]` is either 1 or 4). After appending `len_` to `lens`, the list `lens` will have three elements, with the third element being the current value of `len_`.

Since `len_` is either 1 or 4, let's consider both cases:

1. If `len_` is 1, then `lens` initially is `[<some value>, 1, 1]`.
2. If `len_` is 4, then `lens` initially is `[<some value>, 4, 4]`.

In both cases, the third element of `lens` is updated to the current value of `len_`.

Output State: **`node` is 1, `len_` is either 1 or 4, `lens` is a list with three elements where the second and third elements are the same and equal to `len_`, and `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and the new `len_` for `node` being 1.**
