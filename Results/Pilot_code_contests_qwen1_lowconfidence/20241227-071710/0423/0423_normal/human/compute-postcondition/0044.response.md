The code assigns the value of `nums[node2]` to `num2`. Given the initial state:

- `num2` is `nums[node2 + 1]`
- `nums` is in its original state
- `node2` is `node2 + 1`
- `graph[node2]` is `[num2, node1]`

After executing `num2 = nums[node2]`:

- The value of `num2` changes from `nums[node2 + 1]` to `nums[node2]`.
- All other variables remain in their original state.

Output State: **`num2` is `nums[node2]`, `nums` is in its original state, `node2` is `node2 + 1`, `graph[node2]` is `[num2, node1]`**
