`num2` is assigned the value of `nums[node2]`. Given that `node2` is `node1 + 1`, `num2` will be equal to `nums[node1 + 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `node2` is `node1 + 1`, `num2` is `nums[node1 + 1]`, `n` must be greater than `node1 + 1`**
