Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `node` is 1.
   - `len_` is either 1 or 4.
   - `lens` is a list with three elements where the second and third elements are the same and equal to `len_`.
   - `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`. 

3. **Determine `n`:**
   - Since `node` starts from 1, the loop will execute for `node` values from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `node` needs to be incremented to 2, meaning `n` must be 2.

4. **Adjusting `node`:**
   - `node` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting `len_`:**
   - Since `len_` can be either 1 or 4, and there is no indication that `len_` changes within the loop, it remains as either 1 or 4.

6. **Adjusting `lens`:**
   - `lens` is a list with three elements, and the second and third elements are both equal to `len_`. Since `len_` can be either 1 or 4, `lens` will be `[x, len_, len_]` where `x` is some value (which doesn't affect the equality condition).

7. **Adjusting `max_`:**
   - `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4. Since `len_` can be either 1 or 4, `max_` will remain the same as it was updated in the previous iteration, but it won't change because `len_` is already included in the calculation.

8. **Final State Before Next Iteration:**
   - `node` will be 2.
   - `len_` remains either 1 or 4.
   - `lens` remains `[x, len_, len_]`.
   - `max_` remains the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4.

Therefore, the final state before the next iteration is:

State: **`node` is 2, `len_` is either 1 or 4, `lens` is a list with three elements where the second and third elements are the same and equal to `len_`, and `max_` is the maximum value between the old `max_` and 4.**
