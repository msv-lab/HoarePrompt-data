`graph[node2].append(node1)` appends `node1` to the list at index `node2` in the `graph` dictionary. The initial state shows that `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, and `n` is greater than `node2`. After executing the code, the value of `num1`, `num2`, and `node2` remains unchanged, but the structure of `graph` changes.

Output State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `num2` is equal to `nums[node2]`, `node2` is `node1 + 2`, and `n` is greater than `node2`; `graph[node2]` includes `node1`.**
