According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `node2` and the value of `n`. The loop starts from `node1 + 1` and goes up to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `node2` must be within the range where it starts from `node1 + 1` and does not exceed `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`
- `graph` remains unchanged

The key adjustments needed are related to ensuring that the loop can start and continue executing. Specifically:
1. `node2` should start from `node1 + 1`.
2. There must be at least one valid `node2` in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`num1` is equal to `nums[node1]`, `graph` remains unchanged, `node2` starts from `node1 + 1`, and there must be at least one valid `node2` in the range from `node1 + 1` to `n-1`**
