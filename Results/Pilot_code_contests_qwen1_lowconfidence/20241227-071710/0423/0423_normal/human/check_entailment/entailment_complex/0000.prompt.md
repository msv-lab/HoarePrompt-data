You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a sequence A_1, A_2, ..., A_N and an integer K.

Print the maximum possible length of a sequence B that satisfies the following conditions:

* B is a (not necessarily continuous) subsequence of A.
* For each pair of adjacents elements of B, the absolute difference of the elements is at most K.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 300,000
* 0 \leq A_i \leq 300,000
* 0 \leq K \leq 300,000
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
A_1

A_N


Output

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 300,000 and 0 ≤ K ≤ 300,000. The sequence A is a list of N integers where 0 ≤ A_i ≤ 300,000 for each i in range 1 to N.
def func():
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
    graph = [[] for i in range(n)]
    for node1 in range(n - 1):
        num1 = nums[node1]
        
        for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
            num2 = nums[node2]
            if abs(num1 - num2) <= k:
                graph[node2].append(node1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num1` is the original value of `nums[node1]`, `node1` is the original value of `node1`, `nums` is in its original state, `graph` is a list of lists where for each `node2` in the range `[node1 + 1, n-1]` and for every pair `(node1, node2)` where `abs(nums[node1] - nums[node2]) <= k`, `node1` is appended to `graph[node2]`.
    lens = []
    max_ = 0
    for node in range(n):
        if len(graph[node]) == 0:
            len_ = 1
        else:
            len_ = max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]) + 1
        
        lens.append(len_)
        
        max_ = max(len_, max_)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `node` is a value in the range `[0, n-1]`, `n` is known and valid, `len_` is the length of the longest path starting from `node` in the graph, `lens` is a list where `lens[node]` is the length of the longest path starting from `node`, `max_` is the maximum length of any path found in the graph.
    print(max_)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `A`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `A`, `k` is an integer, and `A` is a list of integers. The function constructs a graph based on the values in `A` and a threshold `k`. For each pair of nodes in the list `A`, if the absolute difference between their values is less than or equal to `k`, an edge is added from one node to the other in the graph. After constructing the graph, the function calculates the length of the longest path starting from each node and finds the maximum path length in the entire graph. Finally, the function prints the maximum path length found.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
