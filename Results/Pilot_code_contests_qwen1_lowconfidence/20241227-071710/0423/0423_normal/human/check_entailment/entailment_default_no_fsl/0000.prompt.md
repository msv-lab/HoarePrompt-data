You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence A_1, A_2, ..., A_N and an integer K.

Print the maximum possible length of a sequence B that satisfies the following conditions:

* B is a (not necessarily continuous) subsequence of A.
* For each pair of adjacents elements of B, the absolute difference of the elements is at most K.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 300,000
* 0 \leq A_i \leq 300,000
* 0 \leq K \leq 300,000
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
A_1
A_2
:
A_N


Output

Print the answer.

Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
    graph = [[] for i in range(n)]
    for node1 in range(n - 1):
        num1 = nums[node1]
        for node2 in range(node1 + 1, n):
            num2 = nums[node2]
            if abs(num1 - num2) <= k:
                graph[node2].append(node1)
    lens = []
    max_ = 0
    for node in range(n):
        if len(graph[node]) == 0:
            len_ = 1
        else:
            len_ = max([lens[kid] for kid in graph[node]]) + 1
        lens.append(len_)
        max_ = max(len_, max_)
    print(max_)


```
Output hints: The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `A`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `A`, `k` is an integer, and `A` is a list of integers. The function constructs a graph based on the values in `A` and a threshold `k`. For each pair of nodes in the list `A`, if the absolute difference between their values is less than or equal to `k`, an edge is added from one node to the other in the graph. After constructing the graph, the function calculates the length of the longest path starting from each node and finds the maximum path length in the entire graph. Finally, the function prints the maximum path length found.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
