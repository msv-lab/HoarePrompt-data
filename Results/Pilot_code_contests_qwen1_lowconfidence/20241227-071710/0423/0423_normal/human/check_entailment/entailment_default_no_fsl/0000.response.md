Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the code constructs a directed graph where an edge exists between two nodes if the absolute difference between their values is at most `K`. However, the problem requires finding the maximum length of a subsequence (not a path in a graph), and the graph construction logic does not account for this.

The graph approach is not suitable for finding the longest subsequence with the given constraint because it does not consider subsequences where elements are not necessarily adjacent in the original sequence. Instead, a dynamic programming (DP) approach would be more appropriate.

Here is a brief outline of what the correct solution should do:
1. Use dynamic programming to keep track of the longest subsequence ending at each index.
2. For each element, update the DP table based on the previous elements within the allowed difference `K`.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it will fail to produce the correct result for many test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
