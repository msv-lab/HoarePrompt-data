Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code constructs a graph where each node points to another node if the absolute difference between their values is at most \( K \). However, this approach does not guarantee finding the maximum possible length of a subsequence \( B \) where the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements is at most \( K \).

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

Input:
```
10 3
1
5
4
3
8
6
9
7
2
4
```

Expected output:
```
7
```

However, the current implementation might not correctly handle sequences where the maximum length is achieved through a more complex pattern than simple adjacency. For instance, in the given example, the sequence \( [1, 4, 7, 2, 4] \) has a length of 5, but the code might not detect this because it is based on direct adjacency rather than considering longer paths through intermediate elements.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated graph traversal method that considers all possible subsequences meeting the criteria, rather than just direct adjacencies.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence the correctness is **False**.
