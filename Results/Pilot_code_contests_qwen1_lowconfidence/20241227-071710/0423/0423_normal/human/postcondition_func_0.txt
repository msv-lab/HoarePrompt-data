The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `A`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `A`, `k` is an integer, and `A` is a list of integers. The function constructs a graph based on the values in `A` and a threshold `k`. For each pair of nodes in the list `A`, if the absolute difference between their values is less than or equal to `k`, an edge is added from one node to the other in the graph. After constructing the graph, the function calculates the length of the longest path starting from each node and finds the maximum path length in the entire graph. Finally, the function prints the maximum path length found.
