Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the inputs `N` and `M` followed by `M` integers representing the broken steps (`a_i`). It processes these inputs as specified in the problem description.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: 
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized to store the number of ways to reach each step, starting with `dp[0] = 1` (indicating there is one way to stay at the ground level).
   - Steps that are broken are marked with `-1` in the `dp` array.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each step from 1 to `N`.
   - For each step, if the step is not broken (`dp[step] >= 0`), it calculates the number of ways to reach that step by considering the previous step (`step - 1`) and the step before the previous step (`step - 2`).
   - The result is stored in `dp[step]` modulo `1000000007`.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is printed after ensuring it is taken modulo `1000000007` to meet the problem constraints.

The program correctly handles all edge cases within the given constraints:
- It initializes the base case properly (`dp[0] = 1`).
- It marks broken steps correctly using `-1`.
- It uses dynamic programming to ensure the correct count of ways to reach each step while avoiding broken steps.
- It ensures the final result is within the required modulo value.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, making it correct.
