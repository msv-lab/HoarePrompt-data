You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a staircase with N steps. Takahashi is now standing at the foot of the stairs, that is, on the 0-th step. He can climb up one or two steps at a time.

However, the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th, \ldots, a_M-th steps are broken, so it is dangerous to set foot on those steps.

How many are there to climb up to the top step, that is, the N-th step, without setting foot on the broken steps? Find the count modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 0 \leq M \leq N-1
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M \leq N-1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M

a_M


Output

Print the number of ways to climb up the stairs under the condition, modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

Program:

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for i in range(0, n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(0, m):
        a = int(raw_input())
        dp[a] = -1
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if dp[step] < 0:
            continue
        ans = 0
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        dp[step] = ans
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle cases where multiple steps are broken. Specifically, the program does not reset the dynamic programming array (`dp`) after marking the broken steps. This leads to incorrect calculations because the values of `dp` are not properly initialized after marking the broken steps.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6 2
3
4
```

The program should output `2` because the valid paths are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5
2. 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6

However, the current implementation will output `4`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the `dp` array is correctly reset or handled after marking the broken steps. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    for _ in range(m):
        a = int(input())
        dp[a] = -1
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if dp[step] < 0:
            continue
        ans = 0
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        dp[step] = ans % 1000000007
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `dp` array is properly handled after marking the broken steps, thus providing the correct result for all cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and M are integers such that 1 <= N <= 10^5 and 0 <= M <= N-1, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_M are integers such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M <= N-1.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    dp = [(0) for i in range(0, n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(0, m):
        a = int(raw_input())
        
        dp[a] = -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`; `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input and must be at least 1; `i` is `m - 1`; `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1` are integers input during the loop iterations.
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if dp[step] < 0:
            continue
        
        ans = 0
        
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        
        dp[step] = ans
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, and for all `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `i` is not equal to any `ai (1 ≤ i ≤ m - 1)`, `dp[i]` is the sum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`, and for all `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `i` is equal to any `ai (1 ≤ i ≤ m - 1)`, `dp[i]` remains -1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input and is at least 1, `i` is `m - 1`, and `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1` are integers input during the loop iterations.
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
