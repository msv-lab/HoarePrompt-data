Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in how it handles the broken steps. Specifically, the line `dp[a] = -1` marks the broken steps, but it does not correctly update the dynamic programming array `dp` for these steps. The code sums `dp[step-1]` and `dp[step-2]` to compute `dp[step]`, but it does not account for the fact that the value at `dp[step]` should be `0` when `step` is a broken step.

To fix this, the code should set `dp[a] = 0` for each broken step `a` instead of `-1`. This ensures that the dynamic programming array correctly reflects that it is not possible to reach a broken step.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for i in range(0, n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(0, m):
        a = int(input())
        dp[a] = 0
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        ans = 0
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        dp[step] = ans % 1000000007
    print(dp[n])
```

With this correction, the code should handle the problem description correctly for every potential case.
