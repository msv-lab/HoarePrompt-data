You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a staircase with N steps. Takahashi is now standing at the foot of the stairs, that is, on the 0-th step. He can climb up one or two steps at a time.

However, the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th, \ldots, a_M-th steps are broken, so it is dangerous to set foot on those steps.

How many are there to climb up to the top step, that is, the N-th step, without setting foot on the broken steps? Find the count modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 0 \leq M \leq N-1
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M \leq N-1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
a_1
a_2
.
.
.
a_M


Output

Print the number of ways to climb up the stairs under the condition, modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

Program:

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for i in range(0, n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(0, m):
        a = int(raw_input())
        dp[a] = -1
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if dp[step] < 0:
            continue
        ans = 0
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        dp[step] = ans
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)


```
Output hints: The function reads two integers \(N\) and \(M\) from standard input, followed by \(M\) integers representing a strictly increasing sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\). It then constructs a dynamic programming array \(dp\) of length \(N+1\), where \(dp[0] = 1\) and \(dp[i] = -1\) for each \(i\) in the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\). For all other indices \(i\), \(dp[i]\) is computed as the sum of \(dp[i-1]\) and \(dp[i-2]\), modulo \(1000000007\). After constructing the array, the function prints \(dp[N] \mod 1000000007\).

This function effectively calculates a modified Fibonacci sequence with specific indices set to \(-1\) based on the given sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\), and then returns the value at index \(N\).

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
