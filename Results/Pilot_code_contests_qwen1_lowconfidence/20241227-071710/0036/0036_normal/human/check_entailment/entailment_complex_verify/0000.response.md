Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the program does not correctly handle cases where multiple steps are broken. Specifically, the program does not reset the dynamic programming array (`dp`) after marking the broken steps. This leads to incorrect calculations because the values of `dp` are not properly initialized after marking the broken steps.

In the annotated version, it is stated that for all `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `i` is equal to any `ai (1 ≤ i ≤ m - 1)`, `dp[i]` remains `-1`. This means that the values for these broken steps are not reset and do not contribute correctly to the subsequent values in the `dp` array. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and produces incorrect results for inputs involving multiple broken steps.
