You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a staircase with N steps. Takahashi is now standing at the foot of the stairs, that is, on the 0-th step. He can climb up one or two steps at a time.

However, the treads of the a_1-th, a_2-th, a_3-th, \ldots, a_M-th steps are broken, so it is dangerous to set foot on those steps.

How many are there to climb up to the top step, that is, the N-th step, without setting foot on the broken steps? Find the count modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 0 \leq M \leq N-1
* 1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M \leq N-1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Output

Print the number of ways to climb up the stairs under the condition, modulo 1\ 000\ 000\ 007.

    dp = [0 for i in range(0, n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(0, m):
        a = int(raw_input())
        dp[a] = -1
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if dp[step] < 0:
            continue
        ans = 0
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        dp[step] = ans
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where climbing two steps would land on a broken step. For example, consider the following scenario:

- `N = 4`
- `M = 1`
- `a_1 = 3`

In this case, the program should return 0 because there is no way to reach the 4th step without landing on the broken step at the 3rd step. However, the current implementation allows reaching the 4th step by taking two steps from the 2nd step, which is not allowed since the 3rd step is broken. 

The program needs to ensure that both single and double steps do not land on a broken step. This can be achieved by checking both `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` before updating `dp[step]`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers \(N\) and \(M\) from standard input, followed by \(M\) integers representing a strictly increasing sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\). It then constructs a dynamic programming array \(dp\) of length \(N+1\), where \(dp[0] = 1\) and \(dp[i] = -1\) for each \(i\) in the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\). For all other indices \(i\), \(dp[i]\) is computed as the sum of \(dp[i-1]\) and \(dp[i-2]\), modulo \(1000000007\). After constructing the array, the function prints \(dp[N] \mod 1000000007\).

This function effectively calculates a modified Fibonacci sequence with specific indices set to \(-1\) based on the given sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\), and then returns the value at index \(N\).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
