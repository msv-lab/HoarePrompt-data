Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the program correctly implements a modified Fibonacci sequence where specific indices (representing broken steps) are set to \(-1\) and the dynamic programming array is updated accordingly. The output hints accurately describe the behavior of the program, and the corrections mentioned in the original assessment have already been applied in the refined version of the program. Therefore, the program now meets the requirements of the problem description and produces the correct results for the given constraints.
