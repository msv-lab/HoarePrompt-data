Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the inputs \(N\) and \(M\) from standard input using `raw_input()`.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length \(N+1\) with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets `dp[0]` to 1 because there is exactly one way to stay at the 0th step (starting point).

2. **Handling Broken Steps**:
   - The program reads \(M\) broken steps and marks them in the `dp` array by setting `dp[a_i]` to -1.
   - This ensures that any path that includes a broken step will not be counted towards the final result.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through each step from 1 to \(N\).
   - For each step, if the step is not marked as broken (`dp[step] != -1`), it calculates the number of ways to reach that step by summing the values from the previous step and the step before that (`dp[step-1]` and `dp[step-2]`).
   - The result is stored back in `dp[step]`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program ensures that all intermediate results are taken modulo \(1000000007\) to prevent overflow.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `dp[N]` modulo \(1000000007\), which represents the number of ways to reach the \(N\)-th step without stepping on any broken steps.

Since the program follows the steps described in the problem statement accurately and handles all cases as specified, it is correct according to the given requirements.
