Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle cases where multiple steps are broken. Specifically, the program does not reset the dynamic programming array (`dp`) after marking the broken steps. This leads to incorrect calculations because the values of `dp` are not properly initialized after marking the broken steps.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6 2
3
4
```

The program should output `2` because the valid paths are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5
2. 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6

However, the current implementation will output `4`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the `dp` array is correctly reset or handled after marking the broken steps. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    dp = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0] = 1
    for _ in range(m):
        a = int(input())
        dp[a] = -1
    for step in range(1, n + 1):
        if dp[step] < 0:
            continue
        ans = 0
        for prev in [1, 2]:
            if step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0:
                ans += dp[step - prev]
        dp[step] = ans % 1000000007
    print(dp[n] % 1000000007)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `dp` array is properly handled after marking the broken steps, thus providing the correct result for all cases.
