Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ways to climb the staircase without stepping on the broken steps. The code uses dynamic programming to build a solution where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the `i-th` step without stepping on any broken steps. 

- The base case `dp[0] = 1` indicates there is one way to stay at the ground level (the starting point).
- For each broken step `a_i`, `dp[a_i]` is set to `-1` to indicate it is not possible to step on that particular step.
- For other steps, the value is calculated as the sum of the values of the previous two steps (`dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`), ensuring that only valid steps are considered.
- Finally, the result is returned modulo `1000000007`.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the code handles all potential cases correctly as described. The dynamic programming approach ensures that all valid paths are accounted for, and invalid steps (broken ones) are properly marked and excluded. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
