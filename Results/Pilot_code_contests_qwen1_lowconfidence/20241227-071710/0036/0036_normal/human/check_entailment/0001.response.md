Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where climbing two steps would land on a broken step. For example, consider the following scenario:

- `N = 4`
- `M = 1`
- `a_1 = 3`

In this case, the program should return 0 because there is no way to reach the 4th step without landing on the broken step at the 3rd step. However, the current implementation allows reaching the 4th step by taking two steps from the 2nd step, which is not allowed since the 3rd step is broken. 

The program needs to ensure that both single and double steps do not land on a broken step. This can be achieved by checking both `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` before updating `dp[step]`.
