The function reads two integers \(N\) and \(M\) from standard input, followed by \(M\) integers representing a strictly increasing sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\). It then constructs a dynamic programming array \(dp\) of length \(N+1\), where \(dp[0] = 1\) and \(dp[i] = -1\) for each \(i\) in the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\). For all other indices \(i\), \(dp[i]\) is computed as the sum of \(dp[i-1]\) and \(dp[i-2]\), modulo \(1000000007\). After constructing the array, the function prints \(dp[N] \mod 1000000007\).

This function effectively calculates a modified Fibonacci sequence with specific indices set to \(-1\) based on the given sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\), and then returns the value at index \(N\).
