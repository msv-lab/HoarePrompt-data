The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. No variables are modified by this statement. Therefore, the preconditions and the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is either 1 or 2; `k + 1 - prev` is greater than or equal to 0; `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0; `dp[k + 1]` is `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`**
