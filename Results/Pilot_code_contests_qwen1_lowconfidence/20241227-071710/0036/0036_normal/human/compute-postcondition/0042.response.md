`ans` is assigned the value of `ans` plus `dp[step - prev]`. Given the initial conditions, `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`. The value of `prev` changes to the other value of 1 or 2, and the value of `dp[step - prev]` remains non-negative. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`prev` is the other value of 1 or 2, `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.**
