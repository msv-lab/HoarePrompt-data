The code `dp[a] = -1` updates the value of the `dp` list at index `a` to `-1`. Initially, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0. The value of `a` is an integer input. Therefore, the first element of `dp` remains unchanged (still 1), and all other elements remain 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is now `-1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is now `-1`; `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input and must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer input.**
