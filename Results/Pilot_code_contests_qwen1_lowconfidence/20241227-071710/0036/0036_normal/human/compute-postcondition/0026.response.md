The code `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to it. The previous values of `i` and `prev` are `m - 1` and `1` respectively. However, the current values of `dp` and `step` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unchanged.

The impact of the code on the program is that `ans` is updated by adding `dp[step - prev]`. Since `prev` is `1`, the expression `step - prev` simplifies to `step - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `prev` is `1`, `ans` is updated by adding `dp[step - 1]` to its current value**
