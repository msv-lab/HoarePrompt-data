The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified and there is no further code to execute after the `continue` statement, the values of the variables do not change from their initial states.

Output State: **`dp[step + 1]` is now `ans`, all other elements in the `dp` list remain unchanged, `n` retains its previous value, `i` is `step + 1`, `ans` retains its previous value**
