The code `dp[a] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element in the list `dp` at index `a`. Given the initial state, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is `-1`. Since the element at index `a` was already `-1`, this assignment does not change its value.

Therefore, the values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is `-1`; `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input and must be greater than 0; `i` is 1**
