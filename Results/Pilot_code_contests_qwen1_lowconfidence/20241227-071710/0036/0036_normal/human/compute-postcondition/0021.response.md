Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `m - 1`; `ans` is `dp[step - prev]` if the condition `step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0` is true, otherwise `ans` remains `0`.***
