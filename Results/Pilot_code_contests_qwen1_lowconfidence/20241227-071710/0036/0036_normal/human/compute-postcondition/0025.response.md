Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `m - 1`
   - `ans` is updated based on the condition `step - 2 >= 0 and dp[step - 2] >= 0`.
     - If the condition is true, `ans` is set to `dp[step - 2]`.
     - Otherwise, `ans` remains `0`.

2. **Loop Statement**: The for loop iterates over the list `[1, 2]`:
   ```python
   for prev in [1, 2]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will iterate twice with `prev` taking the values `1` and `2`.
   - We need to determine the new state after the first iteration of the loop, given the initial state.

### Adjusting the States

- **Iteration Start**:
  - `i` remains `m - 1` (unchanged by the loop).
  - `prev` is set to `1` (the first value in the list).

- **Conditions After First Iteration**:
  - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `prev` will be set to `1` initially.

### New State

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop (after setting `prev` to `1`) will be:

- `i` remains `m - 1`.
- `prev` is now `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `prev` is 1**
