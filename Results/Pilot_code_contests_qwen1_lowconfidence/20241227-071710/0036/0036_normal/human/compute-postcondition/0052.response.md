The code `ans += dp[step - prev]` adds the value of `dp[step - prev]` to `ans`. Given the initial conditions, `ans` is initially 0. After adding `dp[step - prev]` to `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be `dp[step - prev]`.

The values of the other variables (`prev`, `k + 1 - prev`, `dp[(k + 1) - prev]`, `dp[k + 1]`, `step`, and `dp[step - prev]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prev` is either 1 or 2, `k + 1 - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[k + 1]` remains as `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`, `ans` is `dp[step - prev]`, and `step` is greater than or equal to `prev` and `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0**.
