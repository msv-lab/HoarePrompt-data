`dp[0]` is assigned the value `1`. The length of the list `dp` remains `n + 1`, and all elements are initially set to `0`. The value of `dp[0]` is now `1`, while the rest of the elements remain `0`. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1 and all other elements equal to 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input.**
