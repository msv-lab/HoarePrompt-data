The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parameter list. The functionality involves processing values for `N` and `M` (where 1 <= N <= 10^5 and 0 <= M <= N-1) along with an array `a` of length `M` containing integers such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M <= N-1. However, since these constraints and the array `a` are not passed as parameters to the function, they must be defined within the function's scope.

Given the provided information, the function accepts no explicit parameters and processes internal data based on the constraints provided. Since the problem description does not specify what the function returns, we can only describe what it accepts and its internal conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes internal data where N and M are integers such that 1 <= N <= 10^5 and 0 <= M <= N-1, along with an array a of length M containing integers such that 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_M <= N-1.**
