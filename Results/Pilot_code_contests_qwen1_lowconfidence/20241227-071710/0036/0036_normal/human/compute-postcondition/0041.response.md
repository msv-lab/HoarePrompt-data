According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `prev`. The loop iterates over the values `[1, 2]`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `prev` is either 1 or 2.
- `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.

The loop will continue to execute if both `prev` is either 1 or 2 and `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, it means that one of the values (either 1 or 2) was used for `prev` and the condition `step - prev >= 0` was satisfied. Therefore, the next iteration will use the other value for `prev`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `prev` was 1, then the next value for `prev` will be 2.
2. If `prev` was 2, then the next value for `prev` will be 1.

In both cases, `step - prev` will still need to be greater than or equal to 0, and `dp[step - prev]` will still need to be greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `ans` will be increased by `dp[step - prev]` during this iteration.

Since the loop will continue with the next value of `prev`, we need to adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`prev` is the other value of 1 or 2 (if `prev` was 1, it becomes 2, and if `prev` was 2, it becomes 1), `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`**.
