Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `prev` is either 1 or 2.
   - `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.

2. **Loop Analysis**: The for loop iterates over the list `[1, 2]`. This means `prev` takes on the values 1 and 2 in sequence.

3. **Current Iteration State**: Since the loop has just finished one iteration, `prev` would have taken on one of the values (either 1 or 2).

4. **Next Iteration State**: For the next iteration of the loop, `prev` will take on the other value. If `prev` was 1 in the last iteration, it will be 2 in the next iteration, and vice versa.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The condition `step - prev` being greater than or equal to 0 still holds true because the value of `step` does not change between iterations.
   - The condition `dp[step - prev]` being greater than or equal to 0 also remains valid since the value of `dp` does not change between iterations.
   - `ans` will be increased by `dp[step - prev]` again, but now `prev` will be the other value (either 1 or 2).

Given this analysis, let's formulate the new state:

- If `prev` was 1 in the last iteration, it will be 2 in the next iteration.
- If `prev` was 2 in the last iteration, it will be 1 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `prev` will be the other value (if it was 1, it will be 2; if it was 2, it will be 1).
- All other conditions remain the same.

**State:**
- `prev` is the other value (if it was 1, it will be 2; if it was 2, it will be 1).
- `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.

To provide a concrete example, if `prev` was 1 in the last iteration:
State: **`prev` is 2, `step - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - 2]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - 2]`.**

If `prev` was 2 in the last iteration:
State: **`prev` is 1, `step - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - 1]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - 1]`.**

In both cases, the general state can be summarized as:
State: **`prev` is the other value (1 or 2), `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.**
