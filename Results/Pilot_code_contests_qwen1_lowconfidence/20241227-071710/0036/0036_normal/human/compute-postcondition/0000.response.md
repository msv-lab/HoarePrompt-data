`n, m` are assigned the values from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`. This means `n` and `m` will take the first and second integer inputs respectively, and other variables remain unchanged. The preconditions for `N` and `M` being integers within specified ranges are preserved.

Output State: **N and M are integers such that 1 <= N <= 10^5 and 0 <= M <= N-1; `n` is the first integer input and `m` is the second integer input.**
