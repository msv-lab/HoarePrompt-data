The code `a = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since `raw_input()` is used in Python 2, it expects the input to be an integer. The previous value of `dp` remains unchanged, and the other variables are updated accordingly.

- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is now `-1`.
- `n` remains as the first integer input.
- `m` remains as the second integer input and must be greater than 0.
- `i` remains 1, as it is not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is now `-1`; `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input and must be greater than 0; `i` is 1**
