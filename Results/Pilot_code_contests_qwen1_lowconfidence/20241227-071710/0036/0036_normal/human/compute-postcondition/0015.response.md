The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`. `n` must be at least 1. `i` is `m - 1`. The current value of `dp[step]` is less than 0.**
