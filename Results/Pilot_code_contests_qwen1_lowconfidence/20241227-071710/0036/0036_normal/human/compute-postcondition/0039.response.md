The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `dp[step - prev]` to it. Given the initial state where `prev` is either 1 or 2, `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`, the value of `ans` is updated but no other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `prev` is either 1 or 2, `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.

Output State: **`prev` is either 1 or 2, `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.**
