The code updates `dp[step]` to be equal to `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - prev]` for all valid `prev` values, which are either 1 or 2. Since both `prev` values (1 and 2) are valid and `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0 for these values, `ans` will be the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `prev` is either 1 or 2 (unchanged)
- `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0 (unchanged)
- `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0 (unchanged)
- `dp[step]` is now equal to `ans`, which is `dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]`

Output State: **`prev` is either 1 or 2; `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0; `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0; `dp[step]` is `dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]`**
