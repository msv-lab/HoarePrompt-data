Output State: **`prev` is either 1 or 2, `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - prev]` for all valid `prev` values.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `prev` with values 1 and 2.
- For each `prev`, it checks if `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0 and if `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0.
- If both conditions are true, `ans` is incremented by `dp[step - prev]`.

After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will accumulate the values of `dp[step - prev]` for all valid `prev` values (1 and 2). If the loop does not execute at all, `ans` will remain 0. The values of `prev` will be either 1 or 2, and `step - prev` will be greater than or equal to 0 and `dp[step - prev]` will be greater than or equal to 0 for the valid cases.
