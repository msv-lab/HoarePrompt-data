`ans` is incremented by the value of `dp[step - prev]`. The initial value of `ans` is 0, so `ans` will now be equal to `dp[step - prev]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `m - 1`; `ans` is `dp[step - prev]`; the current step is greater than or equal to the previous step and the value of `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0**
