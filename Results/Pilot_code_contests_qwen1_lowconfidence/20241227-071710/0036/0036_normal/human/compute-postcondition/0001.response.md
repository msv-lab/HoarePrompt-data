The code initializes a list `dp` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This means that `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0. The variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input.**
