The code `ans += dp[step - prev]` increments `ans` by the value of `dp[step - prev]`. Given the initial state:

- `prev` is 2
- `k + 1 - prev` is greater than or equal to 0
- `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0
- `dp[k + 1]` remains as `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`
- `ans` is `dp[step - prev]` if `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged (i.e., `ans` is still 0).

Since `prev` is 2, `step - prev` simplifies to `step - 2`. We know that `dp[step - prev]` is `dp[step - 2]` and this value is greater than or equal to 0. Thus, `ans` is updated to `ans + dp[step - 2]`.

Output State: **`prev` is 2, `k + 1 - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[k + 1]` remains as `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`, and `ans` is `ans + dp[step - 2]`.**
