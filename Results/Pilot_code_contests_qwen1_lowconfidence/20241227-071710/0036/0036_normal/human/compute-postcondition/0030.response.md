According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- The value of `dp[step]` is now `ans`.
- All other elements in the `dp` list remain unchanged.
- `n`, `i`, and `ans` retain their previous values.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop variable `step` changes and what conditions need to be met for the loop to continue executing.

1. **Step Variable**: The loop starts with `step = 1` and increments `step` by 1 at each iteration. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `step` is equal to the current value of `i` (or whatever the value was at the end of the last iteration).
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `step` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given this, at the start of the next iteration:
- `step` will be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `step` should still be less than or equal to `n`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `dp[step]` will be updated to the new value of `ans`.
- All other elements in the `dp` list remain unchanged.
- `n` retains its previous value.
- `i` will be updated to `step + 1`.
- `ans` retains its previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`dp[step + 1]` is now `ans`, all other elements in the `dp` list remain unchanged, `n` retains its previous value, `i` is `step + 1`, `ans` retains its previous value**.
