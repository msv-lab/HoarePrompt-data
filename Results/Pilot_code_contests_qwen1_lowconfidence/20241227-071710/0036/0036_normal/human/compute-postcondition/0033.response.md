The code sets `ans` to 0. This affects the variable `ans`. The other variables (`dp`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `dp[step + 1]` is now `ans`, which means `ans` was previously `dp[step + 1]`. After setting `ans` to 0, `dp[step + 1]` is also 0. The output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`dp[step + 1]` is 0, `ans` is 0, all other elements in the `dp` list remain unchanged, `n` retains its previous value, `i` is `step + 1`.**
