Postcondition: ***`prev` is 2, `k + 1 - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[k + 1]` remains as `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`, and `ans` is `ans + dp[step - 2]` if `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged (i.e., `ans` is still 0).***
