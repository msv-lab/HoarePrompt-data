The code initializes `ans` to 0. This does not affect any other variables, so the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`. `n` must be at least 1. `i` is `m - 1`. `ans` is 0.**
