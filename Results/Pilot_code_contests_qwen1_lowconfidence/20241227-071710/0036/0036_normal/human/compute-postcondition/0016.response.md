Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`. `n` must be at least 1. `i` is `m - 1`. If `dp[step]` is less than 0, this condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition's outcome.***
