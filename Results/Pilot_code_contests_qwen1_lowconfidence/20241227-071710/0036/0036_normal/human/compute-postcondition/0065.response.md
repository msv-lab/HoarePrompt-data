Functionality: **The function reads two integers \(N\) and \(M\) from standard input, followed by \(M\) integers representing a strictly increasing sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\). It then constructs a dynamic programming array \(dp\) of length \(N+1\), where \(dp[0] = 1\) and \(dp[i] = -1\) for each \(i\) in the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\). For all other indices \(i\), \(dp[i]\) is computed as the sum of \(dp[i-1]\) and \(dp[i-2]\), modulo \(1000000007\). After constructing the array, the function prints \(dp[N] \mod 1000000007\).

This function effectively calculates a modified Fibonacci sequence with specific indices set to \(-1\) based on the given sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_M\), and then returns the value at index \(N\).**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(N = 1\) and \(M = 0\), the function will only initialize \(dp[0] = 1\) and set \(dp[1] = 0\).
- If \(N = 1\) and \(M > 0\), the function will initialize \(dp[0] = 1\) and set \(dp[a_1] = -1\), resulting in \(dp[1] = -1\).

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values or out-of-bound indices for \(a_i\). Proper validation should be added to ensure the correctness of the input data.
