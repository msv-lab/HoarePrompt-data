`dp[a]` is updated to `-1`. The value of `dp[a]` was previously `-1`, so it remains `-1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is `-1`; `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input and must be greater than 0; `i` is 3.
