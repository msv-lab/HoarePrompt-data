The code updates the `dp` list at index `step` with the value of `ans`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `ans` is the sum of all `dp[step - prev]` where `prev` is `1` or `2` and both conditions `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0` are satisfied.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `dp[step]` is updated to `ans`.

Since the initial value of `dp[step]` is `0` (as per the given initial state), the new value of `dp[step]` will be `ans`.

3. **Output State:**
   - The value of `dp[step]` is now `ans`.
   - All other elements in the `dp` list remain unchanged.
   - `n`, `i`, and `ans` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`; `dp[step]` is `ans`; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `m - 1`; `ans` is the sum of all `dp[step - prev]` where `prev` is `1` or `2` and both conditions `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0` are satisfied.**
