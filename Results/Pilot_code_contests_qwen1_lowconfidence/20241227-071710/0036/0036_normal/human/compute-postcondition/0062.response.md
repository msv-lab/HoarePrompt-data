Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, and for all `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `i` is not equal to any `ai (1 ≤ i ≤ m - 1)`, `dp[i]` is the sum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`, and for all `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `i` is equal to any `ai (1 ≤ i ≤ m - 1)`, `dp[i]` remains -1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input and is at least 1, `i` is `m - 1`, and `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1` are integers input during the loop iterations.**
