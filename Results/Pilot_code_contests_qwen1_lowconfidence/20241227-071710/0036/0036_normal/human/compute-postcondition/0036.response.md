The code `ans += dp[step - prev]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dp[step - prev]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `prev` must be either 1 or 2,
- `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0,
- `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0.

The value of `ans` is updated, but its exact initial value is not specified. We know that `dp[step - prev]` is a non-negative value since it is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the value of `ans` increases by `dp[step - prev]`.

Output State: **`prev` is either 1 or 2, `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is increased by `dp[step - prev]`.**
