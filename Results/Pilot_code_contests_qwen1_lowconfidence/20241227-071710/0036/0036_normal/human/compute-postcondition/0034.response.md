According to the code, the loop iterates over the values `[1, 2]` for the variable `prev`. The loop can execute as long as `prev` takes on the values 1 or 2. 

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `dp[step + 1]` is 0
   - `ans` is 0
   - All other elements in the `dp` list remain unchanged
   - `n` retains its previous value
   - `i` is `step + 1`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `prev` with values 1 and 2.
   - The loop will execute if `prev` is either 1 or 2.

3. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over specific values (1 and 2) of `prev`, there is no need to adjust `dp[step + 1]`, `ans`, or any other element in `dp` that remains unchanged.
   - The initial value of `i` being `step + 1` is already correct and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - The only thing to consider is ensuring that the loop can execute with `prev` taking on the values 1 and 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`prev` must be either 1 or 2**
