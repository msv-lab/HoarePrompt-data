Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1`.
  - The first element of `dp` (i.e., `dp[0]`) is 1.
  - All other elements of `dp` are 0, except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input and must be at least 1.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1` are integers input during the loop iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for step in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initialization of `i`**: The variable `i` is given as `m - 1`. This means `i` should be initialized to `m - 1` before entering the loop.
2. **Range of `step`**: The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n + 1`, inclusive. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `1`.

### Required Adjustments:
- `i` must be set to `m - 1`.
- `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
Given these requirements, the necessary adjustments to the initial state for the loop to execute are:

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`; `n` must be at least 1; `i` is `m - 1`**.
