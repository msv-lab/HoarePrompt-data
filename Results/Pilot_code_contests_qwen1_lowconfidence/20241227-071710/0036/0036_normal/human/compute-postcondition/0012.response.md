Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the elements at indices `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1`, which are `-1`; `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input and must be at least 1; `i` is `m - 1`; `a1`, `a2`, ..., `am-1` are integers input during the loop iterations.**
