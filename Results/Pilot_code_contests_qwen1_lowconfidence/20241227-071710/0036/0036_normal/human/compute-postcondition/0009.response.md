According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is `-1`.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.

To determine the state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:
- The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.

Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2. Since the loop condition does not change `dp`, `n`, or `m`, these values remain the same.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is `-1`; `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input and must be greater than 0; `i` is 2**
