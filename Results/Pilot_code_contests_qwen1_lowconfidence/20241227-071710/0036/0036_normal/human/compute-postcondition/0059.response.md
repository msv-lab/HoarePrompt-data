Postcondition: **`prev` is 1, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `step - prev` is non-negative and `dp[step - prev]` is non-negative, then `ans` is updated by adding `dp[step - 1]` to its current value. If the condition `step - prev >= 0 and dp[step - prev] >= 0` is false, `ans` remains unchanged.**
