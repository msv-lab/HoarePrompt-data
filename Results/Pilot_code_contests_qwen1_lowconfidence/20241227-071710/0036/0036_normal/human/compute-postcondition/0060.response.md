Output State: **`prev` is either 1 or 2, `k + 1 - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[k + 1]` remains as `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`, and `ans` is the sum of `dp[step - 1]` and `dp[step - 2]` if both conditions `step - 1 >= 0` and `dp[step - 1] >= 0` and `step - 2 >= 0` and `dp[step - 2] >= 0` are satisfied. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged (i.e., `ans` is still 0).**
