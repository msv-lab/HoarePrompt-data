According to the code, the loop iterates over `step` from 1 to `n`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `step` must be within the range from 1 to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `prev` is either 1 or 2.
- `step - prev` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `dp[step - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `dp[step]` is `dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `step` must be less than or equal to `n`.
- Since the loop starts at 1, the next value of `step` would be the current `step` value plus 1.

Given the current state:
- If the current `step` is `k`, then the next `step` would be `k + 1`.
- Therefore, `prev` remains the same.
- `step - prev` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `k + 1 - prev` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `dp[step - prev]` must be greater than or equal to 0, so `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `dp[step]` must be updated to `dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]`, so `dp[k + 1]` must be `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`.

Thus, we adjust the states as follows:
- `prev` remains the same (either 1 or 2).
- `step - prev` must be greater than or equal to 0, so `k + 1 - prev` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `dp[step - prev]` must be greater than or equal to 0, so `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `dp[step]` is updated to `dp[step - 1] + dp[step - 2]`, so `dp[k + 1]` is `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`.

State: **`prev` is either 1 or 2; `k + 1 - prev` is greater than or equal to 0; `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0; `dp[k + 1]` is `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`**
