According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and `m` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element equal to 1, all other elements equal to 0 except for the element at index `a`, which is now `-1`; `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input and must be greater than 0; `i` is 1**
