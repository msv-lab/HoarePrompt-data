Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `prev` is either 1 or 2.
   - `k + 1 - prev` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `dp[k + 1]` remains as `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`.
   - `ans` is `dp[step - prev]` if `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged (i.e., `ans` is still 0).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for prev in [1, 2]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `prev` with values `[1, 2]`.
   - Each iteration of the loop updates the state based on the value of `prev`.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - For each value of `prev` in the loop, the state changes according to the given conditions.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the impact of the loop on the state variables.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - After the first iteration of the loop (`prev = 1`), the state will change as follows:
     - `prev` will be set to 1.
     - `k + 1 - prev` becomes `k`.
     - `dp[k]` is updated based on the condition `dp[k + 1] = dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`.
     - `ans` is updated based on the condition `ans = dp[step - prev]` if `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`.
   - After the second iteration of the loop (`prev = 2`), the state will change similarly but with `prev` set to 2.

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop will run for both values of `prev` (1 and 2), we need to ensure that the state reflects the final value of `prev` after the loop completes.
   - Therefore, the state after the loop should reflect the last value of `prev`, which is 2 (since the loop iterates over both 1 and 2).

7. **Resulting State:**
   - `prev` will be 2.
   - `k + 1 - prev` will be `k - 1`.
   - `dp[k]` will be updated based on the condition `dp[k + 1] = dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the condition `ans = dp[step - prev]` if `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`prev` is 2, `k + 1 - prev` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[(k + 1) - prev]` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[k + 1]` remains as `dp[k] + dp[k - 1]`, and `ans` is `dp[step - prev]` if `step - prev >= 0` and `dp[step - prev] >= 0`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged (i.e., `ans` is still 0).**
