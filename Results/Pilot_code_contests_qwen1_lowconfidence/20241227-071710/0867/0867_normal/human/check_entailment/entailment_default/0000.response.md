Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code uses a transformation function `func_1` which is applied to shifted bits without considering the actual overlap factor calculation as defined in the problem description.

The problem description requires calculating the overlap factor as follows:
\[ \text{overlap factor} = \sum_{1 \le i \le na, 1 \le j \le ma, 1 \le i + x \le nb, 1 \le j + y \le mb} a_{i,j} \cdot b_{i+x, j+y} \]

However, the code does not perform this summation directly. Instead, it applies a complex bitwise transformation using `func_1` and only checks if the result is non-zero. This approach does not accurately reflect the definition of the overlap factor.

For example, consider the following input:
```
na = 2, ma = 2
a = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
nb = 2, mb = 2
b = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
```

The correct overlap factor for the shift `(0, 0)` should be:
\[ 0 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \]

But the code would incorrectly compute this due to the transformation in `func_1`, leading to an incorrect result.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
