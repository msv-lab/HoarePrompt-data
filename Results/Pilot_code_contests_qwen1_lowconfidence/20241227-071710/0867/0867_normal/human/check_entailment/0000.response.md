Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search over the shifts of the second table relative to the first table. The program seems to be obfuscated and appears to be using a custom hash function (`func_1`) and bit manipulation, but it does not correctly calculate the overlap factor as defined in the problem description.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

### Input:
```
3 2
01
10
00
2 3
101
111
```

### Expected Output:
```
0 1
```

However, the provided program will not produce the correct output. Here's why:

1. **Hash Function Usage**: The `func_1` function is not used in a way that would help compute the overlap factor. Instead, it appears to be a custom hash function that may not be relevant to the problem at hand.

2. **Bit Manipulation**: The `func_2` function uses bit shifting and masking operations that do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the function does not properly iterate over all possible shifts and calculate the sum of overlapping elements.

3. **Shift Calculation**: The program does not iterate over all possible shifts `(x, y)` within the valid range and compute the overlap factor for each shift.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
