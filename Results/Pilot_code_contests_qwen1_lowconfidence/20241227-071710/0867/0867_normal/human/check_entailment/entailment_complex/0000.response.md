Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code uses bitwise operations in `func_1` and `func_2` which are not aligned with the problem description. According to the problem description, the overlap factor calculation should involve a summation of products of elements from the two tables after shifting the second table. However, the code uses bitwise AND and shift operations, which do not correctly simulate the product of elements.

For example, consider the following input:
```
na, ma = 2, 2
a = ["11", "11"]
nb, mb = 2, 2
b = ["11", "11"]
```

The expected overlap factor for a shift `(0, 0)` would be:
```
1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 4
```

However, the code's `func_1` and `func_2` use bitwise operations that do not accurately reflect this summation. The bitwise operations will mask and combine bits in a way that does not correspond to the product of the elements.

Thus, the code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case.
