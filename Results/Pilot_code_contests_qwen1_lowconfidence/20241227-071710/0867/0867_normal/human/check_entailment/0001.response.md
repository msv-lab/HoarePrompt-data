Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform the necessary operations to calculate the overlap factor as described in the problem statement. Instead, they seem to be obfuscating some integer value through bitwise operations, which is unrelated to the task of finding the shift with the maximum overlap factor.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
1. Iterate over all possible shifts `(x, y)` within the given constraints.
2. For each shift, count the number of overlapping "1"s between the two tables according to the defined formula.
3. Keep track of the shift with the maximum overlap factor.

Since the provided code does not perform these steps, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
