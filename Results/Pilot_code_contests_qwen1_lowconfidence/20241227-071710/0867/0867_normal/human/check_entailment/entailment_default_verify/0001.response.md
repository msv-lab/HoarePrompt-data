Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not implement the required functionality to solve the problem. The output hints for `func_2` describe a process that involves bitwise operations and counting overlapping "1"s, but the implementation details do not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, `func_2` does not iterate over all possible shifts `(x, y)` within the given constraints and does not correctly calculate the overlap factor as defined in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** remains appropriate.
