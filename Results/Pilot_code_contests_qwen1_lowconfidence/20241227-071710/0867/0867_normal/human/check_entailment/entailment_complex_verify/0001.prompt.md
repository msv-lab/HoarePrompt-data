You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got two rectangular tables with sizes na × ma and nb × mb cells. The tables consist of zeroes and ones. We will consider the rows and columns of both tables indexed starting from 1. Then we will define the element of the first table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as ai, j; we will define the element of the second table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as bi, j. 

We will call the pair of integers (x, y) a shift of the second table relative to the first one. We'll call the overlap factor of the shift (x, y) value:

<image>

where the variables i, j take only such values, in which the expression ai, j·bi + x, j + y makes sense. More formally, inequalities 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb must hold. If there are no values of variables i, j, that satisfy the given inequalities, the value of the sum is considered equal to 0. 

Your task is to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor among all possible shifts.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers na, ma (1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the first table. Then na lines contain ma characters each — the elements of the first table. Each character is either a "0", or a "1".

The next line contains two space-separated integers nb, mb (1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the second table. Then follow the elements of the second table in the format, similar to the first table.

It is guaranteed that the first table has at least one number "1". It is guaranteed that the second table has at least one number "1".

Output

Print two space-separated integers x, y (|x|, |y| ≤ 109) — a shift with maximum overlap factor. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform the necessary operations to calculate the overlap factor as described in the problem statement. Instead, they seem to be obfuscating some integer value through bitwise operations, which is unrelated to the task of finding the shift with the maximum overlap factor.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
1. Iterate over all possible shifts `(x, y)` within the given constraints.
2. For each shift, count the number of overlapping "1"s between the two tables according to the defined formula.
3. Keep track of the shift with the maximum overlap factor.

Since the provided code does not perform these steps, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin

(na, ma) = [int(buf) for buf in stdin.readline().strip().split()]
a = [int(stdin.readline().strip()[::-1], 2) for i in range(0, na)]
(nb, mb) = [int(buf) for buf in stdin.readline().strip().split()]
b = [int(stdin.readline().strip()[::-1], 2) for i in range(0, nb)]
(ans, xx, yy) = (0, 0, 0)
for x in range(1 - na, nb):
    for y in range(1 - ma, mb):
        val = func_2(x, y)
        if ans < val:
            (ans, xx, yy) = (val, x, y)
print('%d %d' % (xx, yy))

    79228162495817593524129366015)
    x = (x & 18446744073709551615) + (x >> 32 & 18446744073709551615)
    return x
    #The program returns a value of \(x\) which is calculated as \((x \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215) + ((x >> 16) \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215)\) or \(((x \& 79228162495817593524129366015) + ((x >> 16) \& 79228162495817593524129366015))\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` as input and returns a transformed value of `x`. The transformation involves applying bitwise operations including AND (`&`) and right shift (`>>`). Specifically, the function performs multiple rounds of bitwise AND and right shift operations on `x`, and sums the results. The final value returned is either \((x \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215) + ((x >> 16) \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215)\) or \(((x \& 79228162495817593524129366015) + ((x >> 16) \& 79228162495817593524129366015))\). This process effectively masks parts of `x` and combines them according to the specified bitwise operations. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly; it assumes that `x` is always an integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: na and ma are positive integers such that 1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50. a is a list of strings representing the rows of the first table, where each string consists of '0' and '1'. nb and mb are positive integers such that 1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50. b is a list of strings representing the rows of the second table, where each string consists of '0' and '1'. x and y are integers representing the shift coordinates, with |x|, |y| ≤ 10^9.
def func_2(x, y):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(0, na):
        if i + x in range(0, nb):
            if y > 0:
                cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])
            else:
                cnt += func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: ```plaintext
    #Output State:
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt which contains the number of elements in the list 'numbers' that satisfy a certain condition, but the condition is not specified in the given initial state
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y` with the constraints \( |x|, |y| \leq 10^9 \). It iterates over the first table represented by the list `a` and checks for corresponding elements in the second table represented by the list `b`. For each row `i` in `a`, it performs a bitwise shift operation based on the sign of `y` and accumulates the result using the function `func_1`. If `y` is positive, it left shifts `a[i]` by `y` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `b[i + x]`. If `y` is negative, it right shifts `b[i + x]` by `-y` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `a[i]`. The function counts the number of non-zero results from these operations and returns this count as `cnt`. Potential edge cases include when `i + x` is out of bounds for the list `b`, which is handled within the `if` statement.
