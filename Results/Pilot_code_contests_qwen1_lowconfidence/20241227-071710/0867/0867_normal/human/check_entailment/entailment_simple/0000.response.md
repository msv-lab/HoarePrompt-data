Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program expects binary representations of the tables as input. Specifically, it reads each row of the tables as a binary number using `int(stdin.readline().strip()[::-1], 2)`. This means the input is assumed to be in a specific format (reversed binary string).
   - The problem description, however, states that the tables are represented as strings of '0's and '1's, not as binary numbers. Therefore, the program incorrectly assumes the input format.

2. **Shift Calculation**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` which appears to be a cryptographic hash function or some form of bit manipulation. This function is used to transform the bits in a way that does not correspond to the problem's requirement of calculating the overlap factor.
   - According to the problem description, the overlap factor should be calculated as the sum of products of corresponding elements in shifted positions. The function `func_1` does not perform this calculation.

3. **Overlap Factor Calculation**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates a value using `func_1`, but it does not compute the actual overlap factor as defined in the problem. The overlap factor is supposed to be the sum of products of corresponding elements in the shifted tables, but `func_2` does not perform this operation.
   - The function `func_2` seems to be performing some bitwise operations without correctly implementing the required logic.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the shift `(x, y)` with the maximum overlap factor. However, it does not guarantee that the output will be a valid shift with the maximum overlap factor as per the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
