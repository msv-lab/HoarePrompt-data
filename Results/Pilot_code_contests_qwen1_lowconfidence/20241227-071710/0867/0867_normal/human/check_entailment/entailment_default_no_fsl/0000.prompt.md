You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got two rectangular tables with sizes na × ma and nb × mb cells. The tables consist of zeroes and ones. We will consider the rows and columns of both tables indexed starting from 1. Then we will define the element of the first table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as ai, j; we will define the element of the second table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as bi, j. 

We will call the pair of integers (x, y) a shift of the second table relative to the first one. We'll call the overlap factor of the shift (x, y) value:

<image>

where the variables i, j take only such values, in which the expression ai, j·bi + x, j + y makes sense. More formally, inequalities 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb must hold. If there are no values of variables i, j, that satisfy the given inequalities, the value of the sum is considered equal to 0. 

Your task is to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor among all possible shifts.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers na, ma (1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the first table. Then na lines contain ma characters each — the elements of the first table. Each character is either a "0", or a "1".

The next line contains two space-separated integers nb, mb (1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the second table. Then follow the elements of the second table in the format, similar to the first table.

It is guaranteed that the first table has at least one number "1". It is guaranteed that the second table has at least one number "1".

Output

Print two space-separated integers x, y (|x|, |y| ≤ 109) — a shift with maximum overlap factor. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` as input and returns a transformed value of `x`. The transformation involves applying bitwise operations including AND (`&`) and right shift (`>>`). Specifically, the function performs multiple rounds of bitwise AND and right shift operations on `x`, and sums the results. The final value returned is either \((x \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215) + ((x >> 16) \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215)\) or \(((x \& 79228162495817593524129366015) + ((x >> 16) \& 79228162495817593524129366015))\). This process effectively masks parts of `x` and combines them according to the specified bitwise operations. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly; it assumes that `x` is always an integer.

''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y` with the constraints \( |x|, |y| \leq 10^9 \). It iterates over the first table represented by the list `a` and checks for corresponding elements in the second table represented by the list `b`. For each row `i` in `a`, it performs a bitwise shift operation based on the sign of `y` and accumulates the result using the function `func_1`. If `y` is positive, it left shifts `a[i]` by `y` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `b[i + x]`. If `y` is negative, it right shifts `b[i + x]` by `-y` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `a[i]`. The function counts the number of non-zero results from these operations and returns this count as `cnt`. Potential edge cases include when `i + x` is out of bounds for the list `b`, which is handled within the `if` statement.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
