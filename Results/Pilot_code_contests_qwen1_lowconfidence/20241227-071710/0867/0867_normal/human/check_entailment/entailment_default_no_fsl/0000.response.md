Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not properly handle the range checks required by the problem statement. The problem description requires that the indices `i + x` and `j + y` must satisfy `1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb` and `1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb`. However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not perform these checks, which means it may access indices outside the valid range of the second table.

For example, consider the following input:
```
na, ma = 3, 2
a = [0b01, 0b10, 0b00]
nb, mb = 2, 3
b = [0b001, 0b111]
```

In this case, if `x = 1` and `y = 1`, the code would attempt to access `b[1+1][1+1]`, which is out of bounds since `b` has dimensions 2x3. The correct implementation should include range checks to ensure that the indices are within bounds before performing any operations.

To fix this, the code should include checks similar to:
```python
def func_2(x, y):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(na):
        if 0 <= i + x < nb:
            if y >= 0:
                cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])
            else:
                cnt += func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] >> -y)
    return cnt
```

This ensures that the indices are within the valid range of the second table, thus adhering to the problem description.
