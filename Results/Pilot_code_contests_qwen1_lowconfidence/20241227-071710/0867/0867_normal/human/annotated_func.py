    #The program returns a value of \(x\) which is calculated as \((x \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215) + ((x >> 16) \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215)\) or \(((x \& 79228162495817593524129366015) + ((x >> 16) \& 79228162495817593524129366015))\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` as input and returns a transformed value of `x`. The transformation involves applying bitwise operations including AND (`&`) and right shift (`>>`). Specifically, the function performs multiple rounds of bitwise AND and right shift operations on `x`, and sums the results. The final value returned is either \((x \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215) + ((x >> 16) \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215)\) or \(((x \& 79228162495817593524129366015) + ((x >> 16) \& 79228162495817593524129366015))\). This process effectively masks parts of `x` and combines them according to the specified bitwise operations. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly; it assumes that `x` is always an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: na and ma are positive integers such that 1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50. a is a list of strings representing the rows of the first table, where each string consists of '0' and '1'. nb and mb are positive integers such that 1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50. b is a list of strings representing the rows of the second table, where each string consists of '0' and '1'. x and y are integers representing the shift coordinates, with |x|, |y| ≤ 10^9.

    cnt = 0
    for i in range(0, na):
        if i + x in range(0, nb):
            if y > 0:
                cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])
            else:
                cnt += func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: ```plaintext
    #Output State:
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt which contains the number of elements in the list 'numbers' that satisfy a certain condition, but the condition is not specified in the given initial state
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y` with the constraints \( |x|, |y| \leq 10^9 \). It iterates over the first table represented by the list `a` and checks for corresponding elements in the second table represented by the list `b`. For each row `i` in `a`, it performs a bitwise shift operation based on the sign of `y` and accumulates the result using the function `func_1`. If `y` is positive, it left shifts `a[i]` by `y` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `b[i + x]`. If `y` is negative, it right shifts `b[i + x]` by `-y` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `a[i]`. The function counts the number of non-zero results from these operations and returns this count as `cnt`. Potential edge cases include when `i + x` is out of bounds for the list `b`, which is handled within the `if` statement.
