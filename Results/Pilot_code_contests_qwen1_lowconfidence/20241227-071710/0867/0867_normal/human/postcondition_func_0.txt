The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` as input and returns a transformed value of `x`. The transformation involves applying bitwise operations including AND (`&`) and right shift (`>>`). Specifically, the function performs multiple rounds of bitwise AND and right shift operations on `x`, and sums the results. The final value returned is either \((x \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215) + ((x >> 16) \& 5192217631581220737344928932233215)\) or \(((x \& 79228162495817593524129366015) + ((x >> 16) \& 79228162495817593524129366015))\). This process effectively masks parts of `x` and combines them according to the specified bitwise operations. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly; it assumes that `x` is always an integer.
