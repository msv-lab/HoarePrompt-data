Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y` with the constraints \( |x|, |y| \leq 10^9 \). It iterates over the first table represented by the list `a` and checks for corresponding elements in the second table represented by the list `b`. For each row `i` in `a`, it performs a bitwise shift operation based on the sign of `y` and accumulates the result using the function `func_1`. If `y` is positive, it left shifts `a[i]` by `y` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `b[i + x]`. If `y` is negative, it right shifts `b[i + x]` by `-y` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `a[i]`. The function counts the number of non-zero results from these operations and returns this count as `cnt`. Potential edge cases include when `i + x` is out of bounds for the list `b`, which is handled within the `if` statement.**

**Missing functionality: The postconditions mention that the function returns `cnt` which contains the number of elements in the list `'numbers'` that satisfy a certain condition, but the list `'numbers'` is not defined anywhere in the code. Therefore, the actual list used for counting is the accumulated results from the bitwise operations, not a separate list named `'numbers'`.**
