Postcondition: ***`cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` if `y > 0` or by the result of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` if `y <= 0`. The increment is performed if `i + x` is within the range [0, nb-1]. Variables `na`, `ma`, `a`, `nb`, `mb`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain as per the preconditions.***
