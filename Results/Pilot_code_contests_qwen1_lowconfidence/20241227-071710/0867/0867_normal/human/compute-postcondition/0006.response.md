The code updates the variable `cnt` by adding the result of the function call `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`. However, since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact behavior. We know that `a[i]` and `b[i + x]` are substrings consisting of '0' and '1', and the bitwise AND operation (`&`) is performed between these two substrings. Then, the result is left-shifted by `-y` bits (which is equivalent to right-shifting by `y` bits). Finally, `func_1` is called with this result.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of the expression `a[i] & b[i + x] << -y`. However, we can describe the general effect:

- `cnt` is incremented by the value returned by `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`.
- The value of `i` is not explicitly updated in this line of code, so it remains unchanged.
- The values of `na`, `ma`, `nb`, `mb`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is 0 + the value returned by `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`, `i` is unchanged, `na` is at least 1, `ma` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ ma ≤ 50, `a` is a list of strings representing the rows of the first table, where each string consists of '0' and '1', `nb` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ nb ≤ 50, `mb` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ mb ≤ 50, `b` is a list of strings representing the rows of the second table, where each string consists of '0' and '1', `x` and `y` are integers representing the shift coordinates, with |x|, |y| ≤ 10^9, and `y` is less than or equal to 0.**
