Postcondition: ***`cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` if `y > 0`. Otherwise, `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`. Variables `na`, `ma`, `a`, `nb`, `mb`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain as per the preconditions, with `i + x` within the range [0, nb-1].***
