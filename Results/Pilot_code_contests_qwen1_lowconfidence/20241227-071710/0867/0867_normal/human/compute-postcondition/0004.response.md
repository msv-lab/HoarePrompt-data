The code `cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` impacts the variable `cnt`. It shifts the bits of the string `a[i]` to the left by `y` positions, performs a bitwise AND operation with the string `b[i + x]`, and then applies a function `func_1` to the result of this operation. The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the result of `func_1`.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is 0
- `na` is at least 1
- `ma` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ ma ≤ 50
- `a` is a list of strings representing the rows of the first table, where each string consists of '0' and '1'
- `nb` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ nb ≤ 50
- `mb` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ mb ≤ 50
- `b` is a list of strings representing the rows of the second table, where each string consists of '0' and '1'
- `x` and `y` are integers representing the shift coordinates, with |x|, |y| ≤ 10^9, the index `i + x` is within the range [0, nb-1], and `y` is greater than 0

Since the exact values of `a[i]`, `b[i + x]`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, the output of the bitwise operations and the function `func_1` cannot be specified explicitly. However, we know that `cnt` is updated by the value returned from `func_1`.

Output State: **`cnt` is 0 plus the value returned by `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`, `na` is at least 1, `ma` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ ma ≤ 50, `a` is a list of strings representing the rows of the first table, where each string consists of '0' and '1', `nb` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ nb ≤ 50, `mb` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ mb ≤ 50, `b` is a list of strings representing the rows of the second table, where each string consists of '0' and '1', `x` and `y` are integers representing the shift coordinates, with |x|, |y| ≤ 10^9, the index `i + x` is within the range [0, nb-1], and `y` is greater than 0**.
