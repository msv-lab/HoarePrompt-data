The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers with the constraint that \( |x|, |y| \leq 10^9 \). The function returns `cnt`, which is the count of elements in the list `numbers` that satisfy a certain condition, although the specific condition is not detailed in the given information.
