To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that:

1. The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
2. The condition `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb-1]`.
3. The value of `y` is relevant to determine which function call (`func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` or `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`) is used.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Incrementing `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within the range `[0, na-1]`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

2. **Checking the Range Condition:**
   - The loop will continue if `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb-1]`.
   - Therefore, we need to check if `(i + 1) + x` is within the range `[0, nb-1]`.
   - This simplifies to checking if `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb-2]`.

3. **Function Call Conditions:**
   - The function call depends on the value of `y`.
   - If `y > 0`, the function call is `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`.
   - If `y <= 0`, the function call is `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`.
   - Since these conditions depend on `i` and `x`, they remain unchanged for the next iteration as long as the range condition is satisfied.

Given the above points, we can summarize the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The range condition `i + x` should still be within `[0, nb-2]`.
- The values of `na`, `ma`, `a`, `nb`, `mb`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as the preconditions.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` if `y > 0` or by the result of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` if `y <= 0`. The increment is performed if `(i + 1) + x` is within the range `[0, nb-2]`. Variables `na`, `ma`, `a`, `nb`, `mb`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain as per the preconditions.**

In terms of specific values:
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- The range condition for `i + x` should now be `[0, nb-2]`.

Final State: **`cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[i+1] << y & b[i + x])` if `y > 0` or by the result of `func_1(a[i+1] & b[i + x] << -y)` if `y <= 0`. The increment is performed if `(i + 1) + x` is within the range `[0, nb-2]`. Variables `na`, `ma`, `a`, `nb`, `mb`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain as per the preconditions.**
