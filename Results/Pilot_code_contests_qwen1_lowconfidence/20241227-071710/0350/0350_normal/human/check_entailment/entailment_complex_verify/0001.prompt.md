You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consisting of n non-zero integers (i.e. a_i ≠ 0). 

You have to calculate two following values:

  1. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is negative; 
  2. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is positive; 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) — the elements of the sequence.

Output

Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    n = int(raw_input())
    A = map(int, input().split())
    (idx, size) = (0, len(A))
    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if A[0] > 0:
        (p[0], q[0]) = (1, 0)
    else:
        (q[0], p[0]) = (1, 0)
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle sequences that contain only negative numbers correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
5
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
9 6
```

However, the program will incorrectly output:
```
6 9
```

This happens because the program initializes `p` and `q` based on the sign of the first element, but it does not correctly count the subsegments when the entire sequence consists of negative numbers. Specifically, the program fails to properly count the subsegments where the product is negative.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
import collections
import bisect
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The sequence of integers is provided within the function body through a variable or list, where the length of the sequence is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, and each element in the sequence is a non-zero integer between -10^9 and 10^9 (exclusive of 0).
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    n = int(raw_input())
    A = map(int, input().split())
    idx, size = 0, len(A)
    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if (A[0] > 0) :
        p[0], q[0] = 1, 0
    else :
        q[0], p[0] = 1, 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `idx` is 0, `size` is undefined, `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2, `p` is a list of `size` elements, where the first element is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `q` is a list of `size` elements, where the first element is either 0 or 1, and the rest are 0, depending on whether `A[0]` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `idx` is 0, `i` is `size`.
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a sequence of integers and calculates two sequences, `p` and `q`, based on the sign of each integer in the input sequence. Specifically, `p[i]` represents the count of positive integers encountered up to index `i`, while `q[i]` represents the count of negative integers encountered up to index `i`. After processing, the function prints the sum of elements in `q` and the sum of elements in `p`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the input sequence contains only one element, both `p` and `q` will have one element, with `p[0]` being 1 or 0 based on the sign of the first element, and `q[0]` being 0 or 1 based on the sign of the first element.
- If all elements in the sequence are positive, `p` will contain consecutive numbers starting from 1, and `q` will be all zeros.
- If all elements in the sequence are negative, `q` will contain consecutive numbers starting from 1, and `p` will be all zeros.

Missing functionality in the annotations:
- The annotation stating that `size` is undefined after the if-else block is incorrect. The variable `size` is actually defined as the length of the input sequence `A`.
- The annotation stating that `idx` is 0 and `i` is `size` after the for loop is correct, but it doesn't mention that `i` starts from 1, not 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
