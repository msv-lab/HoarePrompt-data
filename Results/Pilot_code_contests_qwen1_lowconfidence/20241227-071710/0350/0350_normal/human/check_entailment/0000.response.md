Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has several issues that cause it to produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

1. The import statements at the beginning of the program are unnecessary and can be removed.
2. The variable `raw_input` is used in the code, which is not valid in Python 3. It should be replaced with `input`.
3. The logic for calculating the number of subsegments with positive and negative products is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the transition between positive and negative products as the sliding window moves through the array.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input sequence `[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]`. The expected output is `9 6`, but the current implementation will incorrectly output the same number for both positive and negative products, which is `15 15`.

Here is an example input where the program fails:
```
5
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```
The expected output is:
```
9 6
```
But the program outputs:
```
15 15
```

This shows that the program does not correctly count the number of subsegments with negative and positive products. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
