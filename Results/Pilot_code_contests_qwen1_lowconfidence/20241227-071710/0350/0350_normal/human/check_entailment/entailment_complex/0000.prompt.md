You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consisting of n non-zero integers (i.e. a_i ≠ 0). 

You have to calculate two following values:

  1. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is negative; 
  2. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is positive; 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) — the elements of the sequence.

Output

Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import collections
import bisect
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The sequence of integers is provided within the function body through a variable or list, where the length of the sequence is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, and each element in the sequence is a non-zero integer between -10^9 and 10^9 (exclusive of 0).
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    n = int(raw_input())
    A = map(int, input().split())
    idx, size = 0, len(A)
    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if (A[0] > 0) :
        p[0], q[0] = 1, 0
    else :
        q[0], p[0] = 1, 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `idx` is 0, `size` is undefined, `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2, `p` is a list of `size` elements, where the first element is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `q` is a list of `size` elements, where the first element is either 0 or 1, and the rest are 0, depending on whether `A[0]` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `idx` is 0, `i` is `size`.
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a sequence of integers and calculates two sequences, `p` and `q`, based on the sign of each integer in the input sequence. Specifically, `p[i]` represents the count of positive integers encountered up to index `i`, while `q[i]` represents the count of negative integers encountered up to index `i`. After processing, the function prints the sum of elements in `q` and the sum of elements in `p`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the input sequence contains only one element, both `p` and `q` will have one element, with `p[0]` being 1 or 0 based on the sign of the first element, and `q[0]` being 0 or 1 based on the sign of the first element.
- If all elements in the sequence are positive, `p` will contain consecutive numbers starting from 1, and `q` will be all zeros.
- If all elements in the sequence are negative, `q` will contain consecutive numbers starting from 1, and `p` will be all zeros.

Missing functionality in the annotations:
- The annotation stating that `size` is undefined after the if-else block is incorrect. The variable `size` is actually defined as the length of the input sequence `A`.
- The annotation stating that `idx` is 0 and `i` is `size` after the for loop is correct, but it doesn't mention that `i` starts from 1, not 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
