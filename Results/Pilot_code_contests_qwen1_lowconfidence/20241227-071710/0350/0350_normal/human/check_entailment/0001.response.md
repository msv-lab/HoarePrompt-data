Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle sequences that contain only negative numbers correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
5
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
9 6
```

However, the program will incorrectly output:
```
6 9
```

This happens because the program initializes `p` and `q` based on the sign of the first element, but it does not correctly count the subsegments when the entire sequence consists of negative numbers. Specifically, the program fails to properly count the subsegments where the product is negative.
