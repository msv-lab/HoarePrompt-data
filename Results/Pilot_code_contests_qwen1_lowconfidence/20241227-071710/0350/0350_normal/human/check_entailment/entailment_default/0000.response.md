Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly calculate the number of subsegments with negative and positive products. The issue lies in the logic used to update the `p` and `q` arrays. Specifically, the code updates `p[i]` and `q[i]` based on the sign of the current element, but it does not properly account for the product of the subsegments.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following input:

```
5
5 -3 3 -1 1
```

The expected output is `8 7`, meaning there are 8 subsegments with a negative product and 7 subsegments with a positive product. However, the provided code will incorrectly compute these values.

Let's walk through the computation step-by-step:

1. For `i = 0`, `A[0] = 5` (positive):
   - `p[0] = 1`
   - `q[0] = 0`

2. For `i = 1`, `A[1] = -3` (negative):
   - `p[1] = q[0] = 0`
   - `q[1] = p[0] + 1 = 2`

3. For `i = 2`, `A[2] = 3` (positive):
   - `p[2] = p[1] + 1 = 1`
   - `q[2] = q[1] = 2`

4. For `i = 3`, `A[3] = -1` (negative):
   - `p[3] = q[2] = 2`
   - `q[3] = p[2] + 1 = 3`

5. For `i = 4`, `A[4] = 1` (positive):
   - `p[4] = p[3] + 1 = 3`
   - `q[4] = q[3] = 3`

Now, let's calculate the number of subsegments with negative and positive products using the `p` and `q` arrays:

- Negative products: `q[0] + q[1] + q[2] + q[3] + q[4] = 0 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 10`
- Positive products: `p[0] + p[1] + p[2] + p[3] + p[4] = 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7`

This calculation is incorrect because it does not properly account for overlapping subsegments. For example, the subsegment `(5, -3)` has a negative product, but the code does not correctly count all such subsegments.

A correct solution would involve maintaining counts of consecutive negative and positive products and updating these counts as the loop progresses. This ensures that all subsegments are correctly accounted for.

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
