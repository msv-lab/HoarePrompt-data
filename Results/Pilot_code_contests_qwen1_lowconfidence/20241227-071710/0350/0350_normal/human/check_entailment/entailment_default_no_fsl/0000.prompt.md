You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consisting of n non-zero integers (i.e. a_i ≠ 0). 

You have to calculate two following values:

  1. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is negative; 
  2. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is positive; 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) — the elements of the sequence.

Output

Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.

Program:
```
import sys
import collections
import bisect
import math

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    n = int(raw_input())
    A = map(int, input().split())
    (idx, size) = (0, len(A))
    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if A[0] > 0:
        (p[0], q[0]) = (1, 0)
    else:
        (q[0], p[0]) = (1, 0)
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))


```
Output hints: The function processes a sequence of integers and calculates two sequences, `p` and `q`, based on the sign of each integer in the input sequence. Specifically, `p[i]` represents the count of positive integers encountered up to index `i`, while `q[i]` represents the count of negative integers encountered up to index `i`. After processing, the function prints the sum of elements in `q` and the sum of elements in `p`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the input sequence contains only one element, both `p` and `q` will have one element, with `p[0]` being 1 or 0 based on the sign of the first element, and `q[0]` being 0 or 1 based on the sign of the first element.
- If all elements in the sequence are positive, `p` will contain consecutive numbers starting from 1, and `q` will be all zeros.
- If all elements in the sequence are negative, `q` will contain consecutive numbers starting from 1, and `p` will be all zeros.

Missing functionality in the annotations:
- The annotation stating that `size` is undefined after the if-else block is incorrect. The variable `size` is actually defined as the length of the input sequence `A`.
- The annotation stating that `idx` is 0 and `i` is `size` after the for loop is correct, but it doesn't mention that `i` starts from 1, not 0.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
