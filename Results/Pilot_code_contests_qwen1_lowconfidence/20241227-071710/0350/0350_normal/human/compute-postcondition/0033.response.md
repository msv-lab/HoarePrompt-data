Output State: **`size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `idx` is 0, `i` is `size`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = size - 1`.
- Each iteration updates the lists `p` and `q` based on the value of `A[i]`.
- After the loop completes, the final state of `p` and `q` will be determined by the conditions inside the loop.
- Since the loop runs from `1` to `size - 1`, the last index `i` will be `size - 1`, which means `i` will be `size` when the loop terminates.
- The first element of `p` is initialized based on the value of `A[0]`: either `2` if `A[0] > 0` or `q[0]` if `A[0] <= 0`.
- The first element of `q` is initialized based on the opposite condition: `0` if `A[0] > 0` or `1` if `A[0] <= 0`.
- For each subsequent index `i`, `p[i]` and `q[i]` are updated based on the previous values `p[i-1]` and `q[i-1]` according to the conditions in the loop.
- Since the loop processes all elements from `1` to `size - 1`, the final values of `p` and `q` are fully determined by the sequence of operations within the loop, with the initial conditions of `p[0]` and `q[0]` defining the starting point.
