The code snippet `p[i] = q[i - 1]` updates the value of `p[i]` to be equal to `q[i - 1]`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the values of `i` and the indices:

- `i` is 3.
- For `p[i]`, this means `p[3]`.
- For `q[i - 1]`, this means `q[2]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, with `p[2]` being either 3 or 0.
- `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, with `q[2]` being 0 or 1.

Since `i` is 3, `p[3]` is being updated to `q[2]`. The value of `q[2]` can be 0 or 1. Therefore, `p[3]` will be set to 0 or 1.

The other variables (`size`, `p`, `q`, `idx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` must be greater than 3; `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, with `p[2]` being either 3 or 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, with `q[2]` being 0 or 1; `idx` is 0; `i` is 3; `p[3]` is 0 or 1.**
