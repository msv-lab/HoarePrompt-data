The code initializes a list `p` with `size` number of elements, all set to 0. Since `size` is not defined before this line of code, it remains undefined. The value of `total` is determined by the formula `size * (1 + size) / 2`. After executing the line `p = [0] * size`, the value of `idx` remains 0, `total` remains `size * (1 + size) / 2`, and `size` remains undefined.

Output State: **`idx` is 0, `size` is undefined, `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2, `p` is a list of `size` elements, all set to 0**
