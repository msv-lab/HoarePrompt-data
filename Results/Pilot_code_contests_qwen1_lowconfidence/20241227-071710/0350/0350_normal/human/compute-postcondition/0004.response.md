The code `idx, size = 0, len(A)` tries to assign values to `idx` and `size`. However, since `A` is undefined due to the error caused by `n = int(raw_input())`, `len(A)` will raise an error. Therefore, `size` cannot be determined. The only assignment that is valid is `idx = 0`.

Output State: **`idx` is 0; `size` is undefined**
