Postcondition: **`size` must be defined and greater than 0; `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` (either 0 or 1) and the rest are 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0; `idx` is 0. If `A[i]` is greater than 0, the first element of `p` is set to 2. Otherwise, the first element of `p` is set to `q[0]`.**
