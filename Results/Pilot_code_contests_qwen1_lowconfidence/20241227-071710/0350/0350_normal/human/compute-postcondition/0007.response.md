The code initializes a new list `q` with `size` elements, all set to 0. Since `size` is undefined, the exact number of elements in `q` cannot be specified, but it will be equal to the original `size`. The values of `idx`, `total`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is 0, `size` is undefined, `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2, `p` is a list of `size` elements, all set to 0, `q` is a list of `size` elements, all set to 0**
