`q[0]` is assigned the value `1` and `p[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The initial value of `idx` is `0`, `size` is undefined, `total` is defined as `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements all set to `0`, `q` is a list of `size` elements all set to `0`, and `A[0]` is less than or equal to `0`. After the code execution, the values of `p[0]` and `q[0]` are updated.

Output State: **`idx` is 0, `size` is undefined, `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2, `p` is a list of `size` elements, first element is 0 and others are 0, `q` is a list of `size` elements, first element is 1 and others are 0, `A[0]` is less than or equal to 0**
