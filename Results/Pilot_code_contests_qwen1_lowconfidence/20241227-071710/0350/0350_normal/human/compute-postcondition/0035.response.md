The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The sequence of integers is provided within the function body through a variable or list. The length of the sequence is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, and each element in the sequence is a non-zero integer between -10^9 and 10^9 (exclusive of 0).

The function does not return a specific value based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a sequence of integers provided within the function body, with the specified constraints on the sequence's length and the range of its elements.

Functionality: **The function processes a sequence of integers provided within the function body, where the length of the sequence is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, and each element in the sequence is a non-zero integer between -10^9 and 10^9 (exclusive of 0).**
