The code snippet sets `p[i]` to `q[i - 1]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `size` must be greater than 2.
- `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` (either 0 or 1) and the rest are 0.
- `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0.
- `idx` is 0.
- `i` is 2.

Let's break down the impact of the code step by step:

1. Since `i` is 2, `p[i]` refers to `p[2]`.
2. `q[i - 1]` means `q[2 - 1]` which is `q[1]`.

Given that `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `q[1]` must be 0 because all elements except possibly the first one are 0.

Therefore, `p[2]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`size` must be greater than 2; `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, updated to have `p[2]` equal to 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0; `idx` is 0; `i` is 2.**
