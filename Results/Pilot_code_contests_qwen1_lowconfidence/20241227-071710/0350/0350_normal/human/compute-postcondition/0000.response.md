The provided code snippet only changes the way input is read from standard input to using `sys.stdin.readline`. However, the actual values of the variables are not altered or assigned by this line of code. Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The function takes no input parameters. The sequence of integers is provided within the function body through a variable or list, where the length of the sequence is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, and each element in the sequence is a non-zero integer between -10^9 and 10^9 (exclusive of 0).**
