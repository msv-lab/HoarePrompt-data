The code `A = map(int, input().split())` tries to take a sequence of integers as input from the user and convert them into a map object. However, since no input is available (as stated in the precondition), the `input()` function will raise an error, and the `map()` function will not execute.

Therefore, the variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function takes no input parameters. The sequence of integers is provided within the function body through a variable or list, where the length of the sequence is at least 1 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), and each element in the sequence is a non-zero integer between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\) (exclusive of 0). The line `n = int(raw_input())` will raise an error because no input is available. `A` is undefined due to the error.**
