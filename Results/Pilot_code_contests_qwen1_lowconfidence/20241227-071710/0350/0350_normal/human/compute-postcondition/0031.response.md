First, let's analyze the initial state:

- `size` is greater than 3.
- `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, with `p[2]` being either 3 or 0.
- `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, with `q[2]` being 0 or 1.
- `idx` is 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `p[3]` is 0 or 1.

Now, let's run the code snippet:

```python
q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
```

Here, `i` is 3, so the code snippet becomes:

```python
q[3] = p[2] + 1
```

Let's consider the possible values for `p[2]`:

- If `p[2]` is 3, then `q[3]` will be 4.
- If `p[2]` is 0, then `q[3]` will be 1.

Since `q[2]` is either 0 or 1, the value of `q[2]` does not affect `q[3]` because `q[3]` is being assigned a new value independently.

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `size` is greater than 3.
- `p` remains unchanged in terms of its structure and values except for `p[3]`, which is now 0 or 1 (as originally stated).
- `q` changes such that `q[3]` is either 4 or 1.
- `idx` is 0.
- `i` is 3.

Output State: **`size` is greater than 3; `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, with `p[2]` being either 3 or 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, with `q[2]` being 0 or 1; `idx` is 0; `i` is 3; `q[3]` is either 4 or 1; `p[3]` is 0 or 1.**
