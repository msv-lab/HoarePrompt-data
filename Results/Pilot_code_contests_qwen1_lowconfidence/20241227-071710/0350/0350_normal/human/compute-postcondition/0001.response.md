The given code snippet sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\). This does not affect any variables or the sequence of integers provided within the function body. It merely configures the maximum depth of the Python interpreter's call stack.

Output State: **The function takes no input parameters. The sequence of integers is provided within the function body through a variable or list, where the length of the sequence is at least 1 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), and each element in the sequence is a non-zero integer between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\) (exclusive of 0); the system recursion limit is set to \(10^6\).**
