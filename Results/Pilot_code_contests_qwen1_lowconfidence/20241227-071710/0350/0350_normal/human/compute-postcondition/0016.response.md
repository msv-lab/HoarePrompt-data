The code snippet `q[i] = q[i - 1]` tries to assign the value of `q[i - 1]` to `q[i]`. However, since `idx` is 0, the index `i` in the list `q` would be `idx`, which means `i` is 0. But `q[0]` is already 0, so assigning `q[0 - 1]` (which does not exist) to `q[0]` will not change the value of `q[0]`. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` must be defined and greater than 0; `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is 2, the second element is 1, and the rest are 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is 0, and the rest are 0; `idx` is 0**
