The code `p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1` impacts the list `p`. According to the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `p[i]` refers to `p[2]`. The value of `p[1]` (which is `p[i - 1]`) is either 2 or `q[0]` (which is either 0 or 1). Given that `p` initially has the first element as either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest as 0, `p[1]` is 2 (since `q[0]` can only be 0 or 1, and the first element of `p` cannot be 0 in this context).

So, `p[2]` will be `p[1] + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` must be greater than 2; `p` is a list where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, now `p[2]` is 3; `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0; `idx` is 0; `i` is 2**
