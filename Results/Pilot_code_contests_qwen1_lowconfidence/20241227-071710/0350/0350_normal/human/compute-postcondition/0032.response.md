Postcondition: **`size` is greater than 3; `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, with `p[2]` being either 3 or 0; `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, with `q[2]` being 0 or 1; `idx` is 0; `i` is 3; if `A[i] > 0`, then `p[3]` is 4 if `p[2]` is 3, or 1 if `p[2]` is 0, and `q[3]` is 0 or 1 (same as `q[2]`). Otherwise, `q[3]` is either 4 or 1, and `p[3]` is 0 or 1.**
