The code snippet assigns the value of `q[i - 1]` to `q[i]`. Given the initial conditions, let's determine the updated values step-by-step.

- Initially, `i` is 3.
- According to the code, `q[i]` becomes `q[i - 1]`, which translates to `q[3]` becoming `q[2]`.

Since `q[2]` can be either 0 or 1, the new value of `q[3]` will be the same as `q[2]`.

Output State: **`size` must be greater than 3; `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, with `p[2]` being either 3 or 0 depending on the condition; `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, with `q[2]` being 0 or 1 respectively; `idx` is 0; `i` is 3; `p[3]` is 4 if `p[2]` is 3, or 1 if `p[2]` is 0; `q[3]` is 0 or 1 (same as `q[2]`).**
