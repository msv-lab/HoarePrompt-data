The code calculates `total` using the formula `size * (1 + size) / 2`. However, since `size` is undefined in the initial state, the value of `total` cannot be determined explicitly. The only affected variable is `total`, which is now defined but its value depends on the value of `size`.

Output State: **`idx` is 0; `size` is undefined; `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2**
