Postcondition: **`idx` is 0, `size` is undefined, `total` is size * (1 + size) / 2, `p` is a list of `size` elements, where the first element is either 1 or 0, and the rest are 0, `q` is a list of `size` elements, where the first element is either 0 or 1, and the rest are 0, depending on whether `A[0]` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0.**
