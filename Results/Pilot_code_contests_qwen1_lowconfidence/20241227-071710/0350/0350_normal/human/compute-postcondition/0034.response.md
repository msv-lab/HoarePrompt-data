The code prints the sum of the elements in list `q` and the sum of the elements in list `p`. Let's analyze the initial state:

- `size` is a positive integer.
- `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0.
- `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0.
- `idx` is 0.
- `i` is `size`.

Since the lists `p` and `q` are initialized with zeros except for the first element, and given the possible values for the first elements, we can determine the sums:

- For `q`, the sum is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `q[0]` is 0 or 1.
- For `p`, the sum is either 2 or `q[0]` because only the first element is non-zero.

The print statement will output these sums. Thus, the output will be one of the following combinations:

- If `q[0]` is 0, then `sum(q)` is 0 and `sum(p)` is 2.
- If `q[0]` is 1, then `sum(q)` is 1 and `sum(p)` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be either "0 2" or "1 1".

Output State: **`size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 2 or `q[0]` and the rest are 0, `q` is a list of `size` elements where the first element is either 0 or 1 and the rest are 0, `idx` is 0, `i` is `size`, and the output is either "0 2" or "1 1".**
