`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`. However, since the function does not take any input parameters and the input is supposed to be provided within the function body, this line of code will raise an error because there is no input available to `raw_input()`. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The function takes no input parameters. The sequence of integers is provided within the function body through a variable or list, where the length of the sequence is at least 1 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), and each element in the sequence is a non-zero integer between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\) (exclusive of 0). The line `n = int(raw_input())` will raise an error because no input is available.**
