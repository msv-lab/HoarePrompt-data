Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the given ratio. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the value of `delit` and the loop logic is flawed. 

The issue lies in the way `delit` is initialized and updated. `delit` is set to `z / 4` initially, which is not necessarily the maximum possible value for `delit` that satisfies the condition. Instead, it should start from the minimum possible value that satisfies the conditions and increment upwards to find the maximum possible value.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
7
13
```
- According to the problem, the ratio is 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears.
- With 4 lemons, the maximum number of lemons that can be used is 4.
- For 4 lemons, the required number of apples is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) and pears is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
- Since we only have 7 apples, the maximum number of lemons that can be used is 3 (which requires 6 apples and 12 pears, and we have enough pears).

However, the provided code will return 1 because it starts with `delit = 3.25` (which is not an integer), and the loop decrements it to 3, but does not check if 3 is the maximum possible value. This results in an incorrect output.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    limon = int(input())
    yabl = int(input())
    grush = int(input())
    delit = min(limon, yabl // 2, grush // 4)
    print(str(delit * 7))
```

This code correctly determines the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote according to the given ratio.
