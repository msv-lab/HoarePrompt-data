Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, which aims to determine the maximum number of sets of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used in the compote according to the required ratio (1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears). However, the implementation is flawed because it does not properly consider the constraints and the required ratio.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- For each lemon, there must be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears.
- The goal is to maximize the total number of fruits used while maintaining this ratio.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Ratio Check**: The function `func_1` checks whether the current value of `delit` (initially set to `z // 4`) satisfies the condition `y / delit >= 1` and `x / delit >= 1`. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that `delit` should also satisfy the ratio `1:2:4`.

2. **Loop Logic**: The loop decrements `delit` until it finds a value that satisfies both conditions. This approach does not guarantee finding the maximum number of sets that can be formed. For example, if `x = 1`, `y = 2`, and `z = 4`, the initial `delit` would be `1`, and the loop would terminate immediately, incorrectly returning `1` instead of `0`.

#### Example Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
2
5
7
```
- The correct solution should use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears, resulting in a total of `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.
- However, the program will incorrectly return `1` because the loop will terminate at `delit = 1` without considering the ratio properly.

#### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, the function should determine the minimum number of complete sets of fruits (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears) that can be formed. This can be done by calculating the minimum value among `limon`, `yabl // 2`, and `grush // 4`.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(x, y, z):
    if x == 0 or y < 2 or z < 4:
        return 0
    else:
        return min(x, y // 2, z // 4)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine the maximum number of sets of fruits that can be used while maintaining the required ratio. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
