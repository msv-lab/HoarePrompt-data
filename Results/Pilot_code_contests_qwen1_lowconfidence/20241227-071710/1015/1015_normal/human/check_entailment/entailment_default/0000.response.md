Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not always return the correct result. The function checks if `z < 4` or `y < 2` or `x < 1` and returns 0 in those cases. However, the function then attempts to find the maximum number of sets of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used according to the ratio 1:2:4. 

The issue lies in the loop where `delit` is decremented starting from `z / 4`. This approach may miss the correct number of sets, especially when the input values do not evenly divide by 4. For example, consider the case where Nikolay has 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 8 pears. According to the problem description, the maximum number of sets is 1 (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears), but the function would not find this because `z / 4` starts from 2 (since 8 / 4 = 2), and the loop does not correctly decrement to check the possibility of using only 1 set.

To fix this, the function should start from the minimum of `x`, `y / 2`, and `z / 4` and decrement to find the maximum number of complete sets. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(x, y, z):
    if z < 4 or y < 2 or x < 1:
        return 0
    min_sets = min(x, y // 2, z // 4)
    return min_sets

if __name__ == '__main__':
    limon = int(input())
    yabl = int(input())
    grush = int(input())
    delit = func_1(limon, yabl, grush)
    print(str(delit * 7))
```

This corrected function correctly determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used according to the given ratio.
