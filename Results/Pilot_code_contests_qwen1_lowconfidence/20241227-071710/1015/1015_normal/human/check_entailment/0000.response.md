Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of lemons (`limon`) is less than 1. According to the problem description, the number of lemons should be at least 1. However, the current implementation checks if `y` (apples) and `z` (pears) meet the criteria but does not check if `x` (lemons) is at least 1. This can lead to incorrect results if `limon` is less than 1. For example, if the input is:

```
0
5
7
```

The program will incorrectly output 0, whereas the correct output should be 0 since Nikolay doesn't have any lemons to begin with.
