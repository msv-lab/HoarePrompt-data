Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq x, y, z \leq 1000\). It returns an integer based on the following conditions:

1. If `z < 4` or `y < 2` or `x < 1`, the function returns 0.
2. Otherwise, the function initializes `delit` as `z / 4` and enters a loop that decrements `delit` by 1 until `delit` is 1. Within the loop, it checks if both `x / delit >= 1` and `y / delit >= 1`. If both conditions are met, the function returns `delit`. If neither condition is met, the loop continues and `delit` is decremented.

The function returns the greatest integer `k` such that `x / k >= 1` and `y / k >= 1`, or 1 if no such `k` exists within the range of initial `delit` values.**

Edge Cases:
- If `z < 4`, the function immediately returns 0.
- If `y < 2` or `x < 1`, the function also returns 0.
- If `z` is between 4 and 7 (inclusive), the function will return 1 since `delit` will decrement to 1 without finding a valid `k`.
- If `z` is 8, the function will return 2 if both `x / 2 >= 1` and `y / 2 >= 1`, otherwise it will return 1.
- If `z` is 12 or greater, the function can return `z / 4 - 1` or `z / 4 - 2`.

Missing Functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where `z` is exactly 4. In this case, `delit` would be 1, and the loop would check if `x / 1 >= 1` and `y / 1 >= 1`. If both are true, the function should return 1; otherwise, it should return 0. This case is implicitly handled because `delit` starts at `z / 4`, which is 1 when `z` is 4.**

Final State After Program Execution:
- `x` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `y` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer within the range \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\).
- `z` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer within the range \(4 \leq z \leq 1000\).
- The function returns an integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= min(x, y, z / 4)` if such a `k` exists, or 0 otherwise.
