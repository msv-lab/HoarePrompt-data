To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop.

### Given Conditions:
1. `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\).
2. `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\).
3. `z` is a non-negative integer such that \(4 \leq z \leq 1000\).
4. `delit` is defined as \(z / 4 - 1\).
5. The loop continues as long as `delit` is greater than or equal to 1, i.e., \(delit \geq 1\).

### Loop Condition:
The loop will continue to execute as long as `delit` is greater than or equal to 1.

### Current State:
- `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\).
- `z` is a non-negative integer such that \(4 \leq z \leq 1000\).
- `delit` is \(z / 4 - 1\).
- Either \(y / (z / 4 - 1) < 1\) or \(x / (z / 4 - 1) < 1\).

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute one more time, `delit` must be at least 1. 

Since `delit` is defined as \(z / 4 - 1\), we need \(z / 4 - 1 \geq 1\). This simplifies to:
\[ z / 4 \geq 2 \]
\[ z \geq 8 \]

Given the range of `z` is \(4 \leq z \leq 1000\), the minimum value of `z` that satisfies \(z \geq 8\) is 8.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the current value of `z` must be at least 8. No other state adjustments are necessary because the values of `x` and `y` do not affect the loop condition directly in this context.

### Final State:
State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\), `z` is a non-negative integer such that \(8 \leq z \leq 1000\), `delit` is \(z / 4 - 1\), and either \(y / (z / 4 - 1) < 1\) or \(x / (z / 4 - 1) < 1\)**
