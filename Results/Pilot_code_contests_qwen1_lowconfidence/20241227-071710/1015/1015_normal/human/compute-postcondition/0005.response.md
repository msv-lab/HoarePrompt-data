Postcondition: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\), `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\), `z` is a non-negative integer such that \(4 \leq z \leq 1000\), `delit` is \(z / 4\). The condition \(y / delit \geq 1\) and \(x / delit \geq 1\) holds true.**
