Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 1000\); `y` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq y \leq 1000\); `z` is at least 12; `delit` is either \(z / 4 - 2\) or \(z / 4 - 3\).***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block. If the condition `y / delit >= 1 and x / delit >= 1` is true, the function returns a specific value related to `z`. If the condition is false, `delit` is simply decremented by 1, leading to the final values described above.
