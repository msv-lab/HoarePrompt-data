        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, let's analyze the loop step by step.
        #
        #### Initial State
        #- \( x \) is a non-negative integer such that \( 1 \leq x \leq 1000 \)
        #- \( y \) is a non-negative integer such that \( 2 \leq y \leq 1000 \)
        #- \( z \) is a non-negative integer such that \( 4 \leq z \leq 1000 \)
        #- \( delit \) is \( \frac{z}{4} \)
        #
        #### Loop Condition
        #The loop runs as long as \( delit \geq 1 \).
        #
        #### Loop Body
        #- If \( \frac{y}{delit} \geq 1 \) and \( \frac{x}{delit} \geq 1 \), the function returns \( delit \).
        #- Otherwise, \( delit \) is decremented by 1.
        #
        #### Analysis of the Loop
        #
        ##### After 1 iteration
        #- \( delit \) starts at \( \frac{z}{4} \)
        #- If \( \frac{y}{\frac{z}{4}} < 1 \) or \( \frac{x}{\frac{z}{4}} < 1 \), the loop continues.
        #- Otherwise, the function returns \( delit \).
        #
        ##### After 2 iterations
        #- \( delit \) could be \( \frac{z}{4} - 1 \) or \( \frac{z}{4} - 2 \)
        #- The loop continues until \( \frac{y}{delit} \geq 1 \) and \( \frac{x}{delit} \geq 1 \) are both true, or \( delit \) reaches 1.
        #
        ##### After 3 iterations
        #- \( delit \) could be \( \frac{z}{4} - 2 \) or \( \frac{z}{4} - 3 \)
        #- The loop continues until \( \frac{y}{delit} \geq 1 \) and \( \frac{x}{delit} \geq 1 \) are both true, or \( delit \) reaches 1.
        #
        #### General Case
        #The loop will continue decrementing \( delit \) until \( \frac{y}{delit} \geq 1 \) and \( \frac{x}{delit} \geq 1 \) are both true, or \( delit \) reaches 1. At that point, the function will return the current value of \( delit \).
        #
        #### Final Output State
        #- \( x \) is a non-negative integer such that \( 1 \leq x \leq 1000 \)
        #- \( y \) is a non-negative integer such that \( 2 \leq y \leq 1000 \)
        #- \( z \) is a non-negative integer such that \( 4 \leq z \leq 1000 \)
        #- \( delit \) is the greatest integer \( k \) such that \( \frac{x}{k} \geq 1 \) and \( \frac{y}{k} \geq 1 \), or \( delit = 1 \)
        #
        #### Conclusion
        #The final output state is when the loop has executed as many times as necessary to find the greatest \( delit \) such that both \( \frac{x}{delit} \geq 1 \) and \( \frac{y}{delit} \geq 1 \) are true, or \( delit \) reaches 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq x, y, z \leq 1000\). It returns an integer based on the following conditions:

1. If `z < 4` or `y < 2` or `x < 1`, the function returns 0.
2. Otherwise, the function initializes `delit` as `z / 4` and enters a loop that decrements `delit` by 1 until `delit` is 1. Within the loop, it checks if both `x / delit >= 1` and `y / delit >= 1`. If both conditions are met, the function returns `delit`. If neither condition is met, the loop continues and `delit` is decremented.

The function returns the greatest integer `k` such that `x / k >= 1` and `y / k >= 1`, or 1 if no such `k` exists within the range of initial `delit` values.
