The given code snippet does not actually modify any variables or perform any operations; it only provides a docstring for a function that sets the synchronization setting for standard Python streams. Since no actual assignment or calculation is performed in the given code, the variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
