The provided function `func_1` does not contribute to solving the problem described. It appears to manipulate the I/O handling for the input and output streams, likely to disable buffering. However, it does not define or use any of the variables related to the problem, such as `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Since the function does not interact with the problem-specific variables, we cannot derive a precondition related to the problem from this function. Therefore, the precondition for the problem itself should be extracted based on the problem description, not from this function.

Here is the precondition for the problem based on the problem description:

```plaintext
Precondition: **t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
```

This precondition describes the inputs for the problem, which should be considered when solving the problem.
