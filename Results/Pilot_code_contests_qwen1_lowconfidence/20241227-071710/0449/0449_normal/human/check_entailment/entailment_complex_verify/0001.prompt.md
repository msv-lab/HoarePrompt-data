You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, as Sherlock Holmes was tracking down one very important criminal, he found a wonderful painting on the wall. This wall could be represented as a plane. The painting had several concentric circles that divided the wall into several parts. Some parts were painted red and all the other were painted blue. Besides, any two neighboring parts were painted different colors, that is, the red and the blue color were alternating, i. e. followed one after the other. The outer area of the wall (the area that lied outside all circles) was painted blue. Help Sherlock Holmes determine the total area of red parts of the wall.

Let us remind you that two circles are called concentric if their centers coincide. Several circles are called concentric if any two of them are concentric.

Input

The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000) — the circles' radii. It is guaranteed that all circles are different.

Output

Print the single real number — total area of the part of the wall that is painted red. The answer is accepted if absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 4.

Note

In the first sample the picture is just one circle of radius 1. Inner part of the circle is painted red. The area of the red part equals π × 12 = π.

In the second sample there are three circles of radii 1, 4 and 2. Outside part of the second circle is painted blue. Part between the second and the third circles is painted red. Part between the first and the third is painted blue. And, finally, the inner part of the first circle is painted red. Overall there are two red parts: the ring between the second and the third circles and the inner part of the first circle. Total area of the red parts is equal (π × 42 - π × 22) + π × 12 = π × 12 + π = 13π
Program:
```
import sys
import math

def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if nCircles < 1:
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the total area of the red parts of the wall based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of circles and their radii from the standard input.
2. It then calculates the area of each circle squared and stores these values in a list.
3. The areas are sorted to ensure that they are processed in ascending order.
4. The program iterates through the sorted areas, adding the area of the outermost circle to the total area and then subtracting the area of the previous circle for every pair of consecutive circles (if the index is even).
5. Finally, it multiplies the total area by π to get the final result and prints it.

Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, this approach ensures that the alternating colors (red and blue) and the outermost blue area are correctly handled. There are no apparent edge cases or logical errors in the provided code that would cause it to fail for any valid input within the specified range. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles. The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique.
def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if (nCircles < 1) :
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1, and the second line of input contains `nCircles` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique.
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `input` is a non-empty string containing at least `nCircles` radius values, `areas` is a list containing the squared values of all the radius values in `input`, `nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1.
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `input` is a non-empty string containing at least `nCircles` radius values, `areas` is a sorted list containing the squared values of all the radius values in `input`, `nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1, `totalArea` is the sum of the areas adjusted according to the conditions in the loop, `index` is the last index processed in the loop, and `area` is the corresponding area in the `areas` list.
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of concentric circles, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique. It then calculates the sum of the areas of the circles adjusted based on certain conditions and outputs the result multiplied by π. If `n` is less than 1, the function immediately outputs `0`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
