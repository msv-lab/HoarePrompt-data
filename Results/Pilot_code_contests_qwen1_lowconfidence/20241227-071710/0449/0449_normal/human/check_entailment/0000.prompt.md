You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, as Sherlock Holmes was tracking down one very important criminal, he found a wonderful painting on the wall. This wall could be represented as a plane. The painting had several concentric circles that divided the wall into several parts. Some parts were painted red and all the other were painted blue. Besides, any two neighboring parts were painted different colors, that is, the red and the blue color were alternating, i. e. followed one after the other. The outer area of the wall (the area that lied outside all circles) was painted blue. Help Sherlock Holmes determine the total area of red parts of the wall.

Let us remind you that two circles are called concentric if their centers coincide. Several circles are called concentric if any two of them are concentric.

Input

The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000) — the circles' radii. It is guaranteed that all circles are different.

Output

Print the single real number — total area of the part of the wall that is painted red. The answer is accepted if absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 4.

Output

40.8407044967

Note

In the first sample the picture is just one circle of radius 1. Inner part of the circle is painted red. The area of the red part equals π × 12 = π.

In the second sample there are three circles of radii 1, 4 and 2. Outside part of the second circle is painted blue. Part between the second and the third circles is painted red. Part between the first and the third is painted blue. And, finally, the inner part of the first circle is painted red. Overall there are two red parts: the ring between the second and the third circles and the inner part of the first circle. Total area of the red parts is equal (π × 42 - π × 22) + π × 12 = π × 12 + π = 13π
Program:
```
import sys
import math

def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if nCircles < 1:
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
