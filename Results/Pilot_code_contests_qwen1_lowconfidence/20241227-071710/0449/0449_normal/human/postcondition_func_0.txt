The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of concentric circles, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique. It then calculates the sum of the areas of the circles adjusted based on certain conditions and outputs the result multiplied by π. If `n` is less than 1, the function immediately outputs `0`.
