The code `sys.stdout.write('0\n')` writes the string '0' followed by a newline character to the standard output. This operation does not affect the variables `nCircles` or `ri`. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1, and the second line of input contains `nCircles` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique.**
