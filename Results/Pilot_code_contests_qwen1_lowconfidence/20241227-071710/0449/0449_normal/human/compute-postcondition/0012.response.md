The code appends the square of the current radius to the `areas` list. Since `areas` initially contains the squared values of the first four radii, appending the square of the next radius (which is given by `int(radius) * int(radius)`), will add this new value to the list.

Given that `input` is a non-empty string containing at least three radius values, and `areas` is a list containing the squared values of the first four radii, the `areas` list will now contain the squared values of the first five radii.

Therefore, the updated `areas` list will have one more element than before.

Output State: **`input` is a non-empty string containing at least three radius values, `areas` is a list containing the squared values of the first five radii, `nCircles` is 1**
