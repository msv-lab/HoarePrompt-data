Postcondition: ***`input` is a non-empty string containing at least `nCircles` radius values, `areas` is a sorted list containing the squared values of all the radius values in `input` and must have at least three elements, `nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1. If `index == 0`, `totalArea` remains unchanged, if `index == 1`, `totalArea` is updated to `totalArea + area` or `2 * `areas[1] - areas[0]`, and if `index == 3`, `totalArea` is updated to `(areas[3] - areas[2]) + area` or `2 * (areas[3] - areas[2])`, where `area` is the second or third element of the `areas` list accordingly.***
