Functionality: **The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of concentric circles, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique. It then calculates the sum of the areas of the circles adjusted based on certain conditions and outputs the result multiplied by π. If `n` is less than 1, the function immediately outputs `0`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is less than 1, the function will output `0` and terminate without processing further input.
- If the input radii are not unique, the function will still process them, but the requirement for uniqueness should be noted as a constraint.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input radii are valid integers within the specified range (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000). However, it does not perform any validation checks to ensure that the input adheres to these constraints. This means that if the input does not meet these requirements, the function might produce incorrect results or raise exceptions during runtime.
