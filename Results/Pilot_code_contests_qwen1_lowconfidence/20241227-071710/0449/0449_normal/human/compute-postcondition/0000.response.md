The code reads an integer `n` from standard input, which represents the number of concentric circles, and stores it in the variable `nCircles`. The second line of input containing the radii of the circles remains unaffected by this code. 

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nCircles` is the integer read from the first line of input (1 ≤ `nCircles` ≤ 100), and the second line of input contains `nCircles` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique.**
