Postcondition: ***`input` is a non-empty string containing at least `nCircles` radius values, `areas` is a sorted list containing the squared values of all the radius values in `input` and must have at least three elements, `nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1, `index` is incremented by 1 based on the previous value, and `totalArea` is updated by adding the difference between `areas[index]` and `areas[index - 1]` if `index % 2 == 0`. Otherwise, `totalArea` remains unchanged.***
