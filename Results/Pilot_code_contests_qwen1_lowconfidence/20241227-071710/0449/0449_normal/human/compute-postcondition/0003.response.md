The code `sys.exit()` is used to terminate the program immediately. This means that no further code will be executed, and the current state of the variables will be the final state before the program exits.

In the initial state:
- `nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1.
- The second line of input contains `nCircles` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique.

Since the program terminates without any further assignments or operations, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1, the second line of input contains `nCircles` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique.**
