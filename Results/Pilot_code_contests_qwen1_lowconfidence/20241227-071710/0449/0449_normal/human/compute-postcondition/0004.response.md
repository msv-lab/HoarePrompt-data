Postcondition: ***`nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1, and the second line of input contains `nCircles` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000) representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique.***

Explanation: Since the `else` part is empty and there are no operations to change the state of the program, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition when `nCircles < 1`.
