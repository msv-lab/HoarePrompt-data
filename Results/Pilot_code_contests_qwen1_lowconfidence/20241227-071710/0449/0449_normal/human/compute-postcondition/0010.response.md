The code `areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))` impacts the `areas` list by appending the squared value of the `radius` to it. The `radius` is taken from the `input` string, which contains at least two radius values. The `nCircles` variable remains unchanged.

Given that the `areas` list initially contains the squared value of the second radius (from the initial state), and the code appends the squared value of the next radius from the `input` string, the updated `areas` list will contain the squared values of the second and third radii.

Output State: **`input` is a non-empty string containing at least two radius values, `areas` is a list containing the squared values of the second and third radii, `nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1**
