Postcondition: ***`input` is a non-empty string containing at least `nCircles` radius values, `areas` is a sorted list containing the squared values of all the radius values in `input` and must have at least one element, `nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1, `totalArea` is `areas[2] - areas[1]` if `index % 2 == 0`, and `index` is 2. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged (i.e., `totalArea` is still 0, `index` is 1, and `area` is the second element of the `areas` list).***
