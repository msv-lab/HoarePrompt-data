The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, where the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of concentric circles, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000), representing the radii of the circles, where all radii are unique. Based on this input, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, but rather processes the input data.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read two lines of input: the first line containing an integer `n` and the second line containing `n` space-separated integers `ri`. There is no specified return value in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function reads two lines of input: the first line containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the second line containing `n` space-separated integers `ri` (1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000).**
