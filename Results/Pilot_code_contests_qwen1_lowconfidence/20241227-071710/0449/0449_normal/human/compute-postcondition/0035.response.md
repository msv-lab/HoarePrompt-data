`totalArea` is multiplied by `math.pi`. The value of `totalArea` was previously the sum of the areas adjusted according to the conditions in the loop. Since `math.pi` is a constant (approximately 3.14159), multiplying `totalArea` by `math.pi` will scale its value by this constant. The states of the other variables (`input`, `areas`, `nCircles`, `index`, and `area`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input` is a non-empty string containing at least `nCircles` radius values, `areas` is a sorted list containing the squared values of all the radius values in `input`, `nCircles` is an integer with a value less than 1, `totalArea` is the sum of the areas adjusted according to the conditions in the loop scaled by `math.pi`, `index` is the last index processed in the loop, and `area` is the corresponding area in the `areas` list.**
