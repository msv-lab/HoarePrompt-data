You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a rectangular grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. On this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square (s_r,s_c).

Takahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length N. Takahashi's string is S, and Aoki's string is T. S and T both consist of four kinds of letters: `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

The game consists of N steps. The i-th step proceeds as follows:

* First, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of S_i, or does not move the piece.
* Second, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of T_i, or does not move the piece.



Here, to move the piece in the direction of `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`, is to move the piece from square (r,c) to square (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c) and (r+1,c), respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than N steps are done.

Takahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the N steps. Aoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the N steps with the piece remaining on the grid. Determine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.

Constraints

* 2 \leq H,W \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq s_r \leq H
* 1 \leq s_c \leq W
* |S|=|T|=N
* S and T consists of the four kinds of letters `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all possible edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic to update the boundaries (`AO`) is flawed. The program incorrectly updates the boundaries based on the moves made by Takahashi and Aoki, but it does not properly account for the fact that a move might cause the piece to go out of bounds before the next move is made.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 3 3
2 2
RRL
LUD
```

In this case, the initial position of the piece is (2, 2). Takahashi's moves are `RRL` and Aoki's moves are `LUD`. According to the problem description, if a move would take the piece out of the grid, the piece is removed immediately, and the game ends.

However, the program does not correctly handle this scenario. It incorrectly allows the piece to move right from (2, 2) to (2, 3) and then down to (3, 3), which is out of bounds. The program should have stopped the game immediately after the first out-of-bounds move.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the piece goes out of bounds immediately after each move and stop the game if it does. Here is a corrected version of the boundary check:

```python
def func():
    (H, W, N) = map(int, input().split())
    (sr, sc) = map(int, input().split())
    S = input()
    T = input()
    AO = [1, W, 1, H]
    flag = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if S[i] == 'L':
            if sc > 1:
                sc -= 1
            else:
                flag = 1
                break
        elif S[i] == 'R':
            if sc < W:
                sc += 1
            else:
                flag = 1
                break
        elif S[i] == 'U':
            if sr > 1:
                sr -= 1
            else:
                flag = 1
                break
        elif S[i] == 'D':
            if sr < H:
                sr += 1
            else:
                flag = 1
                break
        
        if T[i] == 'L':
            if sc > 1:
                sc -= 1
            else:
                flag = 1
                break
        elif T[i] == 'R':
            if sc < W:
                sc += 1
            else:
                flag = 1
                break
        elif T[i] == 'U':
            if sr > 1:
                sr -= 1
            else:
                flag = 1
                break
        elif T[i] == 'D':
            if sr < H:
                sr += 1
            else:
                flag = 1
                break
    if not flag:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the piece is removed from the grid immediately if a move would take it out of bounds.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: H and W are integers such that 2 ≤ H, W ≤ 2 × 10^5, s_r and s_c are integers such that 1 ≤ s_r ≤ H and 1 ≤ s_c ≤ W, N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, S and T are strings consisting of the four kinds of letters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' such that |S| = |T| = N.
def func():
    H, W, N = map(int, raw_input().split())
    sr, sc = map(int, raw_input().split())
    S = raw_input()
    T = raw_input()
    AO = [1, W, 1, H]
    flag = 0
    for i in reversed(range(N)):
        if i != N - 1:
            if T[i] == 'L':
                AO[1] = min(W, AO[1] + 1)
            elif T[i] == 'R':
                AO[0] = max(1, AO[0] - 1)
            elif T[i] == 'U':
                AO[3] = min(H, AO[3] + 1)
            elif T[i] == 'D':
                AO[2] = max(1, AO[2] - 1)
        
        if S[i] == 'L':
            AO[0] += 1
        elif S[i] == 'R':
            AO[1] -= 1
        elif S[i] == 'U':
            AO[2] += 1
        elif S[i] == 'D':
            AO[3] -= 1
        
        if AO[0] > AO[1] or AO[2] > AO[3]:
            flag = 1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    if (AO[0] > sc or AO[1] < sc or AO[2] > sr or AO[3] < sr) :
        flag = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`AO` is a list of four integers, where either the first element is greater than `sc` or the second element is less than `sc` or the third element is greater than `sr` or the fourth element is less than `sr`. In this case, `flag` is 1. There is no else part in the code, so if none of these conditions are met, `flag` remains unchanged.
    if (flag == 0) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`AO` is a list of four integers, `sc` and `sr` are constants, and `flag` is an integer. If the list `AO` satisfies at least one of the following conditions: the first element is greater than `sc`, the second element is less than `sc`, the third element is greater than `sr`, or the fourth element is less than `sr`, then `flag` is 0 and the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, `flag` is 1 and the function prints 'NO'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
