The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`AO` is a list of four integers, where either the first element is greater than `sc` or the second element is less than `sc` or the third element is greater than `sr` or the fourth element is less than `sr`. In this case, `flag` is 0; we print 'YES'**
