Postcondition: ***`AO` is a list of four integers, where either the first element is greater than `sc` or the second element is less than `sc` or the third element is greater than `sr` or the fourth element is less than `sr`. In this case, `flag` is 1. There is no else part in the code, so if none of these conditions are met, `flag` remains unchanged.***
