Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is `N-2` (if `i` was `N-1` in the previous iteration) or not `N-2` (otherwise), `H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `AO` is either `[1, W, 1, H]` or `[2, W, 1, H]` initially, and `flag` is 1 if certain conditions are met during the execution of `S[i]` and `T[i]` operations, otherwise `flag` retains its previous value. If `S[i] == 'U'`, `AO` is updated to `[1, W, 1, new_AO_3]` or `[2, W, 1, new_AO_3]`, and if `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, `flag` is 1. If `S[i] == 'D'`, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, the current state does not change.***
