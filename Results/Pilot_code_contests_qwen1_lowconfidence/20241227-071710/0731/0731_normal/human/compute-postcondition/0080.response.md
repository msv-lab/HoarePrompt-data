Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is `N-3` if `i` was `N-2` in the previous iteration, or `N-1` otherwise, `H` and `W` are integers between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `flag` is either 1 (if the condition `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]` is met for any move in `S`) or remains unchanged (if none of the specified moves cause the condition to be true). If `S[i] == 'R'`, then `AO[1]` is decreased by 1. If `S[i] == 'U'`, then `AO[2]` is updated to `AO[2]_initial + 1` and `AO[3]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `AO[2]` is updated to `AO[2]_initial + 1` and `AO[3]` is decreased by 1.***
