Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is `N-2` (if `i` was `N-1` in the previous iteration) or not `N-2` (otherwise), `H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `AO` is `[1, W, 1, H-1]` or `[2, W, 1, H-1]` depending on its initial value, `flag` is 1 if certain conditions are met, otherwise it retains its previous value. If `S[i] == 'D'`, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, the current state does not change.***
