Postcondition: **`AO` is a list of four integers, where either the first element is greater than `sc` or the second element is less than `sc` or the third element is greater than `sr` or the fourth element is less than `sr`. In this case, `flag` is 0. `aO` is a list of integers, and the value of `flag` is currently 0.**
