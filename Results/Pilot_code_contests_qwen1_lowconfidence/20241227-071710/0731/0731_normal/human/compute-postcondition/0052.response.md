Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is `N-2` (if `i` was `N-1` in the previous iteration) or not `N-2` (otherwise), `H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `AO` is `[1, W, 1, H]` or `[2, W, 1, H]`. Depending on the value of `T[i]`:
- If `T[i] == 'L'`, `AO` is updated to `[1, min(W, AO[1] + 1), 1, H]` or `[2, min(W, AO[1] + 1), 1, H]`, and if `AO[0] > min(W, AO[1] + 1)` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, then `flag` is 1.
- If `T[i] == 'R'`, `AO` remains `[1, W, 1, H]` or `[2, W, 1, H]`, and if `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, then `flag` is 1.
- If `T[i] == 'U'`, `AO` is updated to `[1, W, 1, new_AO_3]` or `[2, W, 1, new_AO_3]`, and if `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, then `flag` is 1.
- If `T[i] == 'D'`, `flag` is set to 1. In all other cases, the current state does not change.***
