The code `H, W, N = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `H`, `W`, and `N`. The values of `s_r`, `s_c`, `S`, and `T` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `H`, `W`, and `N`, along with the unchanged values of `s_r`, `s_c`, `S`, and `T`.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `W` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `N` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `s_r` is an integer between 1 and `H`, `s_c` is an integer between 1 and `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.**
