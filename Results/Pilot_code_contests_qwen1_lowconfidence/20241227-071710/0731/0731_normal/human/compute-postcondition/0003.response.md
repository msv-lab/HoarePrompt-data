`T` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input from the user and converts it to a string. The values of `H`, `W`, `N`, `s_r`, `s_c`, `S`, and `T` are as per the initial state, but now `T` holds the new input from the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `W` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `N` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' and it is equal to the input from the user.

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `W` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `N` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D' and it is equal to the input from the user.**
