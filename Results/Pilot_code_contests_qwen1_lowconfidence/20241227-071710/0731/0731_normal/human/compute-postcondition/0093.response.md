Postcondition: ***`AO` is a list of four integers, `sc` and `sr` are constants, and `flag` is an integer. If the list `AO` satisfies at least one of the following conditions: the first element is greater than `sc`, the second element is less than `sc`, the third element is greater than `sr`, or the fourth element is less than `sr`, then `flag` is 0 and the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, `flag` is 1 and the function prints 'NO'.***
