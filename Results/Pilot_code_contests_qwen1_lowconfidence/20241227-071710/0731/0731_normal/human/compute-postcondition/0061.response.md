The code sets `flag` to 1. This action affects only the `flag` variable, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is `N-2` if `i` was `N-1` in the previous iteration, or not `N-2` otherwise, `H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `flag` is 1.
