Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is not `N-1`, `H` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `W` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', and `AO` is `[1, W, 1, H]`. `flag` is 0. If `T[i]` is 'R', `i` remains unchanged. If `T[i]` is 'U', `AO` is updated to `[1, W, 1, 2]`. If `T[i]` is 'D', `i` remains `N-1` and `T[i]` remains 'D'. In all other cases, the current state does not change.***
