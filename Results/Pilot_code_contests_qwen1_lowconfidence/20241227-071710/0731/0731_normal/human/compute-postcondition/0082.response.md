The line `flag = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `flag`. This sets `flag` to 1 regardless of its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is `N-3` if `i` was `N-2` in the previous iteration, or `N-1` otherwise, `H` and `W` are integers between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `flag` is 1.**
