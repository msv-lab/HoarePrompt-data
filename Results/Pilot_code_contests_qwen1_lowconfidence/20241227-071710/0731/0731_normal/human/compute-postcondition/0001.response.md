The code `sr, sc = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `sr` and `sc`. The previous values of `s_r` and `s_c` are overwritten by these new values.

The output state after running this code is:

Output State: **`H` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `W` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `N` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.**
