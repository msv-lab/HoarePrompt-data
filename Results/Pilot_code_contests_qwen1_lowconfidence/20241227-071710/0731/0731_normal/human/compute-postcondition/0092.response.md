The code snippet `print('NO')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. The values of `AO` and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`AO` is a list of four integers, where the first element is less than or equal to `sc`, the second element is greater than or equal to `sc`, the third element is less than or equal to `sr`, and the fourth element is greater than or equal to `sr`; `flag` is 1; print statement executes and outputs 'NO'**
