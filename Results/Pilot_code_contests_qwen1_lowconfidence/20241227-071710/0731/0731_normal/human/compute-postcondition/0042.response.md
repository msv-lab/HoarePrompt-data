Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is either `N-1` (if `T[i]` is 'D') or not `N-1` (otherwise), `H` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `W` is an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\), `s_r` is equal to `sr`, `s_c` is equal to `sc`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', and `AO` is `[1, W, 1, H]` or `[2, W, 1, H]`. If `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, then `flag` is 1. In all other cases, the current state does not change.***
