The function accepts a single string input from the user, which should be formatted as a sequence of space-separated integers. It then splits the string by spaces, converts each segment to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This process ensures that any valid input string following the specified format will be correctly transformed into a list of integers. Potential edge cases include empty strings or strings with no integers, which would result in an empty list. Additionally, the function assumes the input strictly follows the format, meaning it will raise an error if the input contains non-integer values or additional characters outside the expected format.
