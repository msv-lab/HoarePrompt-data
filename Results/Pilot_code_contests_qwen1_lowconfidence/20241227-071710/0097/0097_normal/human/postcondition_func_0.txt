The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of multiple moments when Polycarp checked his gaming statistics. For each test case, it verifies whether the statistics follow certain rules:
1. The number of plays (p_i) should always be greater than or equal to the previous number of plays (p_{i-1}).
2. The number of clears (c_i) should always be greater than or equal to the previous number of clears (c_{i-1}).
3. The number of clears (c_i) should never exceed the number of plays (p_i).
4. If the number of clears increases between two consecutive moments, the increase in clears should not exceed the increase in plays.

If any of these conditions are violated during the processing of a test case, the function prints 'NO' for that test case. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function iterates through all test cases until `t` becomes zero. After executing the function, the state of the program will have `t` set to 0, and no further actions will be performed on the remaining variables.
