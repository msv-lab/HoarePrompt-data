t is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of moments Polycarp peeked at the stats, and zz is a list of n pairs of integers (p_i, c_i), where p_i is the number of plays and c_i is the number of clears at the i-th moment of time. Each pair (p_i, c_i) in zz satisfies 0 ≤ p_i, c_i ≤ 1000, and the pairs are given in chronological order.
