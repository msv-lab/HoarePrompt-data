The function `STR()` reads input from the standard input for a given number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of moments Polycarp peeked at the stats (`n`), followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the number of plays (`p_i`) and clears (`c_i`) at each moment. The function then returns a list of strings, where each string represents the input for each test case in the format "n p_1 c_1 p_2 c_2 ... p_n c_n". This list contains one string per test case. The function does not modify any external state and only processes input and formats it as specified. Potential edge cases include handling invalid input (e.g., negative numbers or non-integer values) and ensuring that the input is read correctly for each test case. However, the provided code does not include any error handling for such cases.
