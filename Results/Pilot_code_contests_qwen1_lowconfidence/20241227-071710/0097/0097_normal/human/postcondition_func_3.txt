The function accepts input from the user, specifically a positive integer `T` such that \(1 \leq T \leq 500\) representing the number of test cases, a positive integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) representing the number of pairs, and `n` pairs of non-negative integers \((p_i, c_i)\) where \(0 \leq p_i, c_i \leq 1000\). The function then returns a tuple containing these inputs: \((T, n, p_i, c_i)\). The function ensures that the input values meet the specified constraints, and it processes the input in a single line using the `map` function. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs such as negative numbers or values outside the specified ranges, which would result in incorrect processing. The function does not handle any missing functionality beyond the basic requirement of accepting and returning the input as a tuple.
