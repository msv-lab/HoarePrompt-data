Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code for `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to verify the correctness of Polycarp's records. Specifically, the code fails to handle several critical cases as described in the problem description:

1. **Decrease in Plays**: The code does not check if the number of plays decreases between two consecutive moments. According to the problem description, the number of plays should never decrease.
   - Example: `0 0` -> `1 1` -> `0 2` (Invalid, as the number of plays decreases from 1 to 0.)

2. **Increase in Clears Exceeding Increase in Plays**: The code checks if the increase in clears exceeds the increase in plays, but it does not ensure that the number of clears does not exceed the number of plays at any point.
   - Example: `0 0` -> `1 1` -> `2 3` (Invalid, as the number of clears increases to 3 without corresponding increases in plays.)

To fix these issues, the code should include checks for both of the above conditions. Here is a revised version of the function that addresses these concerns:

```python
def func_1():
    t = INT()
    while t != 0:
        n = INT()
        zz = [LIST() for _ in range(n)]
        prevplay = 0
        prevclr = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(n):
            p, c = zz[i]
            if p < prevplay or c < prevclr or c > p:
                flag = 1
                break
            if c > prevclr:
                if c - prevclr > p - prevplay:
                    flag = 1
                    break
            prevplay = p
            prevclr = c
        if flag == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        t -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The number of plays never decreases.
- The number of clears does not exceed the number of plays.
- The increase in clears does not exceed the increase in plays.

Since the original code does not handle these critical cases, the correctness of the program is **False**.
