Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of clears can exceed the number of plays between two consecutive moments of time. Specifically, the condition `if zz[i][1] > prevClr` does not guarantee that the difference between the number of clears and the number of plays is non-negative throughout the entire sequence. 

Consider the following test case:
```
3
0 0
1 1
1 2
```

Here, at the third moment of time, the number of clears is 2, but the number of plays is still 1. This violates the rule that the number of clears cannot exceed the number of plays without additional plays occurring first. The current implementation does not account for this, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the number of clears never exceeds the number of plays at any point in the sequence. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    t = INT()
    while t != 0:
        n = INT()
        zz = [LIST() for _ in range(n)]
        prevplay = 0
        prevClr = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(n):
            p, c = zz[i]
            if p < prevplay or c < prevClr or c > p:
                flag = 1
                break
            prevplay = p
            prevClr = c
        if flag == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        t -= 1
```

This ensures that the number of clears (`c`) is always less than or equal to the number of plays (`p`) at any point in the sequence.
