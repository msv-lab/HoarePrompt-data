The function `sortDictWithVal` takes a dictionary `passedDic` as input, sorts its items based on the criteria specified by the lambda function (first by the tuple values, then by the keys if the values are equal), and returns a new dictionary `toret`. This new dictionary contains the same key-value pairs as the sorted items from `temp`, where each key is the first element of the tuple and each value is the second element of the corresponding tuple in `temp`. The function handles the case where multiple entries might have the same values, ensuring the correct sorting order based on the keys. The returned dictionary maintains the sorted order of the original entries as determined by the lambda function.
