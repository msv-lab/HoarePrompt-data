The function `sortListWithIndex` accepts a list of tuples `listOfTuples`, where each tuple contains exactly two non-negative integers representing the number of plays and clears at a certain moment, and an integer `idx` specifying the index of the element in the tuple to be used for sorting (0 for plays or 1 for clears). The function returns a new list of tuples that is sorted based on the `idx`-th element of each tuple. The original `listOfTuples` remains unchanged. Potential edge cases include empty lists or `listOfTuples` containing tuples with less than two elements, which would raise a `TypeError`. However, the function does not explicitly handle these cases, so the behavior in such scenarios is undefined.
