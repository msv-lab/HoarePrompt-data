The function `sortDictWithKey` accepts a dictionary `passedDic` where the keys are integers representing the moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats, and the values are tuples containing two integers `(p, c)` where `p` is the number of plays and `c` is the number of clears at that moment. The function ensures that the returned dictionary maintains the same structure but guarantees that its keys are sorted in ascending order. This is achieved by converting the dictionary to an `OrderedDict`, sorting its items, and then converting it back to a dictionary. The function does not modify the original dictionary but returns a new one with the sorted keys.
