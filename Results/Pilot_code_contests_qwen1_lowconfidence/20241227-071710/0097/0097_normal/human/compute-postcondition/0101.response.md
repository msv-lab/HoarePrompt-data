`prevClr` is assigned the value of `zz[i][1]`. The value of `zz[i][1]` is now stored in `prevClr`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `flag`, `prevplay`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is set to `new_n + n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[i][0]`, and `prevClr` is equal to `zz[i][1]`.**
