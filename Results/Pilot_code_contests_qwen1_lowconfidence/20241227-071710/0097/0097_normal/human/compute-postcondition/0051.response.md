Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`, and `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`. If `temp > temp1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `temp <= temp1`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
