Postcondition: ***`i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, and `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`. If `zz[i][0] < prevplay` or `zz[i][1] < prevClr` or `zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition is not met.***
