The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after executing this line, `i` will become 2. The states of the other variables (`A`, `numb`, and `sign`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0 or -43 depending on the value of `s[i]`, `sign` is -1 (if `s[i]` is `b'-'[0]`), and `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is `b'-'[0]`, `numb` is either the integer value of `s[i]` or 0, and `sign` is -1. If `s[i]` is not `b'-'[0]`, `A` becomes `[0]`, `numb` is `0`, and `sign` is `1`.**
