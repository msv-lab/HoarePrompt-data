Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1. If `zz[i][1] > prevClr`, then `temp1` is updated to `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]` and `temp` is updated to `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`. If `temp > temp1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
