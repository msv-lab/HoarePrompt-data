`n` is assigned the value `INT()`, where `INT()` is not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet. It's unclear what `INT()` represents. However, based on the typical usage, it likely means `int(input())`. Given the context, let's assume `INT()` is equivalent to `int(input())`.

Since the code snippet only updates `n` by assigning it the value of `int(input())`, and no other variables are affected, the output state will be:

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + 2 * n`, `n` is `int(input())`, `flag` is 1 or not 1, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `temp1` is an empty list `[]`, `t` must be 1**
