Functionality: The function `func_2` takes a parameter `zero` (although it is not used in the function), reads a byte string from standard input, processes it to convert characters to integers, and appends the resulting integers to a list `A`. After processing, the function appends an additional element `0` to the list `A` and returns it. 

- The function reads a byte string `s` from standard input.
- It initializes `numb` to `zero` and `sign` to `1`.
- It iterates over each character in `s`, converting digits to integers and appending them to `A` with the appropriate sign.
- If a `-` character is encountered, it sets `sign` to `-1`.
- If a newline character (`\r`) is not encountered, it appends the current number (`numb`) to `A` with the current sign and resets `numb` and `sign`.
- After the loop, if the last character of `s` is a digit, it appends the final number to `A`.
- Finally, the function returns the list `A` with an additional element `0` appended to it.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle non-digit characters other than `-` and `\r` explicitly. Characters other than digits, `-`, and `\r` are ignored.
- The function assumes that the input is a valid byte string. If the input is not a byte string, the function may raise a `TypeError`.
- The function uses `sys.stdin.buffer.read()` to read the entire input at once, which could potentially cause issues with very large inputs.
- The function does not provide feedback or error handling for invalid input, such as non-byte string input or improperly formatted data.
