The code `print('NO')` does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. It only prints the string 'NO' to the console. The variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `flag` is 1, and `temp1` is an empty list. The value of `flag` is 1**
