Postcondition: **`i` is `new_n + n`, `n` is greater than 0, `zz` is a list of lists, `flag` is set to 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken if `zz[i][0]` is less than `prevplay` or `zz[i][1]` is less than `prevClr` or `zz[i][0]` is less than `zz[i][1]`, otherwise the values of `i`, `n`, `zz`, and `flag` remain unchanged; `temp1` is `zz[i][0] - prevplay`, `temp` is `zz[i][1] - prevClr`. The current value of `temp` is greater than the current value of `temp1`.**
