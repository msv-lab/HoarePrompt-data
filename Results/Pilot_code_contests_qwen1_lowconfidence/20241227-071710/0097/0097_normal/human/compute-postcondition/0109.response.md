The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`, `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1] - prevClr`, and `temp1` is 0.**
