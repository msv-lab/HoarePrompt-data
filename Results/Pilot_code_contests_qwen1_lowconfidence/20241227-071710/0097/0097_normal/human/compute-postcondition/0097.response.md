The code `break` does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch-case structure. Since there is no such structure in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the loop or switch-case would terminate. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `temp` is `zz[i][1] - prevClr`, `temp1` is `zz[i][0] - prevplay`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
