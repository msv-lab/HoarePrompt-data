The code `break` does not affect any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. Since no such loop or switch statement is present in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`, and `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
