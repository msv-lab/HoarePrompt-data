`zz.append(LIST())` appends an empty list to the `zz` list. The last element of `zz` will be an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `new_n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `zz` is `[prevplay, prevClr, [], []`, new empty list], `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `flag` is either 1 or not 1, `temp1` is an empty list, and `t` is 1.
