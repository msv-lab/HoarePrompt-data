`t` is decremented by 1, and the previous values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `flag`, `prevplay`, `prevClr`, `temp1`) remain unchanged. Since no direct action is performed on `i`, `n`, `flag`, `prevplay`, `prevClr`, or `temp1`, their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + 2n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `flag` is 1 or not 1, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `temp1` is an empty list `[]`, `t` is decreased by 1.**
