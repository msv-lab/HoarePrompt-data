`prevplay` is reassigned to the value of `zz[i][0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `prevClr` also remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `flag`, and `temp1` remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `prevplay`.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[i][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`, and `temp1` is 0.**
