Postcondition: ***`A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0 or -43, `sign` is -1, and `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, `numb` is either -48, -47, ..., -39 if it was initially 0, or -478, -481, ..., -473 if it was initially -43, and `sign` remains -1, `i` becomes 3. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is `\r`, no change occurs. Otherwise, `A` becomes [0] or [43], `numb` becomes 0 or -43, and `sign` changes to 1.***
