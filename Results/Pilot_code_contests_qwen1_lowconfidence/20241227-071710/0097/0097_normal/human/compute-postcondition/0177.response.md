The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is the last `zz[i][0]` where the loop was executed, `prevClr` is the last `zz[i][1]` where the loop was executed, `flag` is not 1, and `i` is `n-1`. The console prints 'YES'**
