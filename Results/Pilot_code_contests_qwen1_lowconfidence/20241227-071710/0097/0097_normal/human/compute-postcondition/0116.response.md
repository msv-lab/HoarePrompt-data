The code `print('NO')` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints 'NO' to the console. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + 2n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `temp1` is an empty list `[]`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
