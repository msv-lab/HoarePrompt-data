`sign` is assigned the value `-1`. This value does not depend on any other variable's state, so it is directly updated. The other variables remain in their initial state since they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`A` is an empty list, `numb` is either the integer value of `s[i]` (if `s[i] >= b'0'[0]`) or 0, `sign` is -1, `i` is 1, and the variable `s` remains undefined.**
