`temp1` is assigned the value of `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. Given that `i` is 1, `zz[i][0]` is `zz[1][0]`. The value of `zz[1][0]` is unknown, but `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`. So, `temp1` is calculated as `zz[1][0] - zz[0][0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `None`, `flag` is `1`, `i` is `1`, `temp` is `zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[1][0] - zz[0][0]`**
