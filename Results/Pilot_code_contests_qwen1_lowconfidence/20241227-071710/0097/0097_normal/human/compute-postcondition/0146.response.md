Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, `flag` is 1, `i` is 0. If `zz[i][1]` is greater than `prevClr`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out, and no further changes occur to the variables. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
