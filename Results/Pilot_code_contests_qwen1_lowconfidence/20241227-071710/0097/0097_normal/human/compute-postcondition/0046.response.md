Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of integers with an additional element 0, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, `i` is the length of `s`. If the last character of the non-empty byte string `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part provided.***
