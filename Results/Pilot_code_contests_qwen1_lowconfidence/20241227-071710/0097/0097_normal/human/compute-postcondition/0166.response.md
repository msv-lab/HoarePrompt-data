`temp1` is assigned the value of `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 2, so `zz[i][0]` is `zz[2][0]`. Also, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`. Therefore, `temp1` is calculated as `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`, and `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`**.
