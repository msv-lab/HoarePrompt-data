The code assigns `-1` to the variable `sign`. The value of `sign` was `-1` initially, and this assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`A`, `numb`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0 or -43 depending on the value of `s[i]`, `sign` is -1, and `i` is 2.**
