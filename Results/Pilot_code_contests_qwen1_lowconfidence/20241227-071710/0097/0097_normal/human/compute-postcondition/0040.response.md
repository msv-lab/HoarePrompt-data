The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. 

Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0 or -43, `sign` is -1, and `i` is 3. If `s[3]` is greater than or equal to `b'0'[0]`, `numb` is either -48, -47, ..., -39 if it was initially 0, or -478, -481, ..., -473 if it was initially -43, and `sign` remains -1, `i` becomes 3. Otherwise, if `s[3]` is `\r`, no change occurs. Otherwise, `A` becomes [0] or [43], `numb` becomes 0 or -43, and `sign` changes to 1.**
