The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block it is inside, but it does not change the values of any variables outside of that block. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is set to `new_n + n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
