Postcondition: ***`i` is `new_n + n`, `n` is greater than 0, `zz` is a list of lists, `flag` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken if `zz[i][0]` is less than `prevplay` or `zz[i][1]` is less than `prevClr` or `zz[i][0]` is less than `zz[i][1]`; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `zz`, and `flag` remain unchanged. If `zz[i][1] > prevClr`, then `temp1 = zz[i][0] - prevplay` and `temp = zz[i][1] - prevClr`. If `temp > temp1`, the condition is met and the program continues as described. If `temp <= temp1`, the condition is not met and the program breaks the loop or maintains the current state.***
