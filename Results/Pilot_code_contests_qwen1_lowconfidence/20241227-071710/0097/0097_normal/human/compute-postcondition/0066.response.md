The code `zz.append(LIST())` appends an empty list to the list `zz`. Given the initial state, the list `zz` is currently an empty list with `zz[0]` being `[prevplay, prevClr]` since `zz[n-1][0]` and `zz[n-1][1]` represent the last element in the list.

After appending an empty list, the new state of `zz` will be:
- `zz` becomes `[prevplay, prevClr, []]`

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `zz` is `[prevplay, prevClr, []]`, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `flag` is either 1 or not 1, `temp1` is an empty list, and `t` is 1**
