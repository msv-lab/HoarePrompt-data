The variable `sign` is assigned the value `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0, `sign` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined, and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`.

Output State: **`A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0, `sign` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined, and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`**
