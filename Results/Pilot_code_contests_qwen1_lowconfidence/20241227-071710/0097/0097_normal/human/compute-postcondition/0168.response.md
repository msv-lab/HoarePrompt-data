The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`**
