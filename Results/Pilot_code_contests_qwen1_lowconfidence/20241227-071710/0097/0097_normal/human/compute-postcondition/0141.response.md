`temp1` is assigned the value of `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. Given that `i` is 0, `zz[i][0]` is the same as `zz[0][0]`. The value of `zz[0][0]` is unknown but it exists in the list. `prevplay` is 0. Therefore, `temp1` becomes `zz[0][0] - 0`, which simplifies to `zz[0][0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, `flag` is 1, `i` is 0, `temp` is `zz[i][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[0][0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
