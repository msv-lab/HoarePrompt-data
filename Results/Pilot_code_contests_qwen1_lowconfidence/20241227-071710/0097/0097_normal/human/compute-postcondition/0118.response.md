The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables. It only prints 'YES' to the console. The output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + 2n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `flag` is not 1, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `temp1` is an empty list `[]`.**
