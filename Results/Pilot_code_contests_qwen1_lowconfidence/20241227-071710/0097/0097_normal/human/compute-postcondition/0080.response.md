Postcondition: ***`i` is `new_n + n`, `n` is greater than 0, `zz` is a list of lists, `flag` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken if `zz[i][0]` is less than `prevplay` or `zz[i][1]` is less than `prevClr` or `zz[i][0]` is less than `zz[i][1]`, otherwise the values of `i`, `n`, `zz`, and `flag` remain unchanged. Given the if condition `zz[i][1] > prevClr`, the current value of `zz[i][1]` is greater than `prevClr`.***
