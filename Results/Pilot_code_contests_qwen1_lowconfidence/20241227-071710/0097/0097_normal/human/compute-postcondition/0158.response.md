Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `None`, `flag` is 1, `i` is 1. If `zz[i][1] > prevClr`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change in the values of the variables is specified.***
