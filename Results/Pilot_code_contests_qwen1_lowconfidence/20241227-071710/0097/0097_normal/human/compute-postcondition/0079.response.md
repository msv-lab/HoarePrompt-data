Postcondition: ***`i` is `new_n + n`, `n` is greater than 0. If `zz[i][0]` is less than `prevplay` or `zz[i][1]` is less than `prevClr` or `zz[i][0]` is less than `zz[i][1]`, then `flag` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `zz`, and `flag` remain unchanged.***
