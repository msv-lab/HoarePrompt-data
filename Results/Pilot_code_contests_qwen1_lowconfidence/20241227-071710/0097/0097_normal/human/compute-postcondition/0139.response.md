Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, `flag` is 1, `i` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if either `zz[i][0] < prevplay`, `zz[i][1] < prevClr`, or `zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]` holds true. Additionally, `zz[i][1]` is greater than `prevClr`.***
