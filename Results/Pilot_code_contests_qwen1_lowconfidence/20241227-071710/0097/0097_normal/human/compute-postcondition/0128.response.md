According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the variable `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `zz` is `[[], []]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, it will still be a positive integer, but now it will be `n - 1`.

The state of `zz` remains unchanged as there is no operation on `zz` inside the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `zz` is `[[], []]`**
