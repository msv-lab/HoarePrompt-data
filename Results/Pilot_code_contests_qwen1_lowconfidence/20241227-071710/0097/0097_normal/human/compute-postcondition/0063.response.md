The code `n = INT()` updates the variable `n` to an integer value obtained from the `INT()` function, which is likely intended to represent `int(input())`. However, since no input is specified, we will consider the impact of this code on the given variables.

Here are the steps:

1. The initial state is defined with specific values and conditions.
2. The code `n = INT()` changes the value of `n` to an integer obtained from some unspecified source (like `int(input())`).

Since the exact value of the input is not specified, we will denote the new value of `n` as `new_n`.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n`, `n` is `new_n`, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `flag` is either 1 or not 1, `temp1` is an empty list, and `t` is 1**
