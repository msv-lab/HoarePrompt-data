According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 because if `n` were reduced to 1 or 0, the loop would terminate.

At the start of the next iteration, `n` will be decremented by 1 (since the loop runs from `range(n)`). Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 to allow another iteration.

The additional empty list in the `zz` list does not affect the loop condition directly, but it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `zz` is a list containing an additional empty list**
