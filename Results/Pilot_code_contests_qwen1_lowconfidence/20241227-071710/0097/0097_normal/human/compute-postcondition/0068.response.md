The code `zz.append(LIST())` appends an empty list to the end of the `zz` list. The `LIST()` function call returns an empty list `[]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `zz` is `[prevplay, prevClr, [], []]`, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `flag` is either 1 or not 1, `temp1` is an empty list, and `t` is 1**
