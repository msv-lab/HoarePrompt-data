Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is 2. If `zz[i][0] < prevplay` or `zz[i][1] < prevClr` or `zz[i][0] < zz[i][1]`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold true.***
