Postcondition: ***`A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0 or -43 depending on the value of `s[i]`, `sign` is -1 (if `s[i] == b'-'[0]`), and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is `b'-'[0]`, `numb` is either the integer value of `s[i]` or 0, and `sign` is -1. If `s[i]` is not `b'-'[0]`, `A` becomes `[0]`, `numb` is `0`, and `sign` is `1`.***
