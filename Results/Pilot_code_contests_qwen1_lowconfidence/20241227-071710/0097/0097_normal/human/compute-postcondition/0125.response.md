`zz.append(LIST())` appends an empty list to the `zz` list. Since `n` is a positive integer and does not interact with the code snippet in any way, its value remains unchanged. The variable `zz` now contains an additional empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `zz` is a list containing an additional empty list**
