In the given code, `numb = zero` is executed. However, the variable `zero` is not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet. Assuming `zero` refers to the integer `0`, the code updates the variable `numb` to `0`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0**
