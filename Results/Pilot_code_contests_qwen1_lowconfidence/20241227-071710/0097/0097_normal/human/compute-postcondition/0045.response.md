The code `A.append(sign * numb)` appends the value of `sign * numb` to the list `A`. Given the initial state, `numb` is 0, and `sign` is 1. Therefore, `sign * numb` equals `1 * 0`, which is 0. This value is appended to the list `A`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the updated state is:

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers with an additional element 0, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, `i` is the length of `s`, `s` is a non-empty byte string with its last character being greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0'**
