The code snippet `numb = 10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48` impacts the following:

- `numb` is initially `0`.
- `conv(s[i])` converts the character `s[i]` to its corresponding integer value (since `s[i]` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of `'0'`, this conversion is valid).
- `numb` is updated to `10 * numb + (conv(s[i]) - 48)`, which means it multiplies the current value of `numb` by 10 and adds the integer value of `s[i]` minus 48.

Given the initial state, `numb` is updated as follows:

- `numb` was initially `0`.
- The term `10 * numb` is `0`.
- `conv(s[i]) - 48` converts the character to its integer value and subtracts 48 from it.

Therefore, `numb` is now equal to the integer value of `s[i]`.

Output State: **`A` is an empty list, `numb` is the integer value of `s[i]`, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, `s` is undefined.**
