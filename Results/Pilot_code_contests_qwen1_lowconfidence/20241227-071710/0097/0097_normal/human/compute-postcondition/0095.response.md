`temp1` is assigned the value `zz[i][0] - prevplay`. The value of `zz[i][0]` is not specified directly, but it is part of the list `zz` at index `i`. The value of `prevplay` is also not specified directly. However, the value of `temp` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`i`, `n`, `flag`, and `temp`) are updated or not affected accordingly.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `temp` is `zz[i][1] - prevClr`, `temp1` is `zz[i][0] - prevplay`**
