Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[n-1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[n-1][1]`, `flag` is either 1 or not 1, and `temp1` is an empty list. If `flag` is 1, it remains unchanged. If `flag` is not 1, it also remains unchanged.***
