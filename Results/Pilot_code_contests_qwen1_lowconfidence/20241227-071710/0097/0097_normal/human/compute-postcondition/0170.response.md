Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[1][0]`, `prevClr` is `zz[1][1]`, `flag` is 1, `i` is 2, and `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]`. If `zz[i][1] > prevClr`, then `temp` is `zz[2][1] - zz[1][1]` and `temp1` is `zz[2][0] - zz[1][0]` and no change occurs. Otherwise, the condition remains as is.***
