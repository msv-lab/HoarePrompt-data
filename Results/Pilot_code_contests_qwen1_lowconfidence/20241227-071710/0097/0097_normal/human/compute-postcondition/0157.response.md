Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is `zz[0][0]`, `prevClr` is `None`, `flag` is 1, `i` is 1, `temp` is `zz[1][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[1][0] - zz[0][0]`. If `temp > temp1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change in the values of the variables is specified since there is no else part.***
