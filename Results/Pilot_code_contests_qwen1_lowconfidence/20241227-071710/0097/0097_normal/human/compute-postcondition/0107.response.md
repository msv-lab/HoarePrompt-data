The code assigns `zz[i][0] - prevplay` to `temp1`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is `new_n + n + 2`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `flag` is 1
- `prevplay` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`
- `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`
- `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1] - prevClr`

After executing the line `temp1 = zz[i][0] - prevplay`:

- `temp1` is assigned the value `zz[i][0] - prevplay`.
- Since `i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `prevplay` is `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, and `zz[i]` refers to `zz[new_n + n + 2]`, `temp1` simplifies to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0] - zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, which equals `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`, `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1] - prevClr`, and `temp1` is `0`.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`, `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1] - prevClr`, and `temp1` is `0`.**
