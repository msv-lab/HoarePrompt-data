Postcondition: ***`A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0, `sign` is -1, `i` is 0, and `s` is undefined. Since the condition `s[i] == b'-'[0]` is met, the if part is executed and `sign` is set to -1. The else part does not change the program state because it is not executed under the given precondition.***
