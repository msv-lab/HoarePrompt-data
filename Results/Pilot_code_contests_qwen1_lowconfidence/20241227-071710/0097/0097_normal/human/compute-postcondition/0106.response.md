`temp` is assigned the value of `zz[i][1] - prevClr`. The value of `zz[i][1]` is `prevClr + temp`, and the previous value of `prevClr` is stored in `prevClr`. The values of `i`, `n`, `flag`, `prevplay`, and `prevClr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`, and `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1] - prevClr`.

Output State: **`i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`, and `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1] - prevClr`.**
