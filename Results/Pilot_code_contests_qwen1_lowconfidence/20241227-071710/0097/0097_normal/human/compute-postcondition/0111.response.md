Postcondition: ***`i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, and `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`. If `zz[i][1] > prevClr`, then `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1] - prevClr` and `temp1` is 0. Otherwise, no changes occur since the condition `zz[i][1] > prevClr` does not hold. The break condition is checked throughout, and if met, the loop or if statement is exited.***
