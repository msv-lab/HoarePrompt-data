Postcondition: ***`i` is `new_n + n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `flag` is 1, `prevplay` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][0]`, `prevClr` is equal to `zz[new_n + n + 2][1]`, `temp` is equal to `zz[i][1] - prevClr`, and `temp1` is 0. If `temp > temp1`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, no changes occur since there is no else part specified.***
