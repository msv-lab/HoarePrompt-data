`A` is an empty list, which means `A == []`. The code appends `sign * numb` to `A`. Given that `sign` is 1 and `numb` is 0, `sign * numb` evaluates to `1 * 0`, which is `0`. After appending this value to `A`, `A` becomes `[0]`.

The variables `numb`, `sign`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`A` is `[0]`, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, and `s` is undefined.**
