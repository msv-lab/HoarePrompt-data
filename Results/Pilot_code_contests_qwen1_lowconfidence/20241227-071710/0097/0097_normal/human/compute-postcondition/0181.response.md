The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases.
For each test case:
- `n`: An integer representing the number of moments Polycarp peeked at the stats.
- `zz`: A list of `n` pairs of integers `(p_i, c_i)`, where `p_i` is the number of plays and `c_i` is the number of clears at the i-th moment of time. Each pair `(p_i, c_i)` in `zz` satisfies `0 ≤ p_i, c_i ≤ 1000`, and the pairs are given in chronological order.

The function has two cases based on the output:
- **Case_1**: If any of the conditions result in an error or specific condition not met, the function returns an appropriate message or value.
- **Case_2**: If all conditions are met correctly, the function returns a calculated value or result based on the input data.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `zz`, and process the data to determine a specific outcome or value based on the given constraints and conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `zz`. It processes the data and returns a calculated value or result based on the given constraints and conditions.**
