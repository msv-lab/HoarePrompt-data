Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is 0, `prevClr` is 0, `flag` is 1, `i` is 0, `temp` is `zz[i][1]`, `temp1` is `zz[0][0]`. If the current value of `temp` is greater than `temp1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, no further changes occur to the variables.***
