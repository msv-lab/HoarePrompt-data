#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of moments Polycarp peeked at the stats, and zz is a list of n pairs of integers (p_i, c_i), where p_i is the number of plays and c_i is the number of clears at the i-th moment of time. Each pair (p_i, c_i) in zz satisfies 0 ≤ p_i, c_i ≤ 1000, and the pairs are given in chronological order.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `zz` is a list containing `n` empty lists, `prevplay` is the last `zz[i][0]` where the loop was executed, `prevClr` is the last `zz[i][1]` where the loop was executed, `flag` is either 1 or not 1, `temp1` is an empty list `[]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of multiple moments when Polycarp checked his gaming statistics. For each test case, it verifies whether the statistics follow certain rules:
1. The number of plays (p_i) should always be greater than or equal to the previous number of plays (p_{i-1}).
2. The number of clears (c_i) should always be greater than or equal to the previous number of clears (c_{i-1}).
3. The number of clears (c_i) should never exceed the number of plays (p_i).
4. If the number of clears increases between two consecutive moments, the increase in clears should not exceed the increase in plays.

If any of these conditions are violated during the processing of a test case, the function prints 'NO' for that test case. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function iterates through all test cases until `t` becomes zero. After executing the function, the state of the program will have `t` set to 0, and no further actions will be performed on the remaining variables.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the number of moments Polycarp peeked at the stats, and for each pair (p_i, c_i), p_i and c_i are non-negative integers representing the number of plays and clears at the i-th moment respectively.
def STR():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of strings representing the input for each test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `STR()` reads input from the standard input for a given number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of moments Polycarp peeked at the stats (`n`), followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the number of plays (`p_i`) and clears (`c_i`) at each moment. The function then returns a list of strings, where each string represents the input for each test case in the format "n p_1 c_1 p_2 c_2 ... p_n c_n". This list contains one string per test case. The function does not modify any external state and only processes input and formats it as specified. Potential edge cases include handling invalid input (e.g., negative numbers or non-integer values) and ensuring that the input is read correctly for each test case. However, the provided code does not include any error handling for such cases.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each pair (p_i, c_i) is a pair of integers such that 0 ≤ p_i, c_i ≤ 1000 and the pairs are given in chronological order.
def INT():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user, which is within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 500 for the test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `INT()` reads an integer input from the user, ensuring it is within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 500. If the input is outside this range, the function will continue to prompt the user until a valid input is received. After validation, the function returns the integer input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 500. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each pair (p_i, c_i) consists of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= p_i, c_i <= 1000, and the pairs are provided in chronological order.
def MAP():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a tuple of integers (T, n, p_i, c_i) as input from user, where T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 500, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and each pair (p_i, c_i) consists of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= p_i, c_i <= 1000
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user, specifically a positive integer `T` such that \(1 \leq T \leq 500\) representing the number of test cases, a positive integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) representing the number of pairs, and `n` pairs of non-negative integers \((p_i, c_i)\) where \(0 \leq p_i, c_i \leq 1000\). The function then returns a tuple containing these inputs: \((T, n, p_i, c_i)\). The function ensures that the input values meet the specified constraints, and it processes the input in a single line using the `map` function. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs such as negative numbers or values outside the specified ranges, which would result in incorrect processing. The function does not handle any missing functionality beyond the basic requirement of accepting and returning the input as a tuple.

Each pair (p_i, c_i) consists of two non-negative integers such that 0 <= p_i, c_i <= 1000, and the pairs are given in chronological order.
def LIST():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers created by converting the input split by spaces into integers, given that the input follows the format specified in the initial state
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single string input from the user, which should be formatted as a sequence of space-separated integers. It then splits the string by spaces, converts each segment to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This process ensures that any valid input string following the specified format will be correctly transformed into a list of integers. Potential edge cases include empty strings or strings with no integers, which would result in an empty list. Additionally, the function assumes the input strictly follows the format, meaning it will raise an error if the input contains non-integer values or additional characters outside the expected format.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of the 2D list, and c is the value to fill in the list.
def list2d(a, b, c):
    return [([c] * b) for i in range(a)]
    #The program returns a 2D list (a x b) filled with the value c
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `list2d` accepts three parameters: `a` (the number of rows), `b` (the number of columns), and `c` (the value to fill in the 2D list). It returns a 2D list (an `a x b` matrix) where each element is set to the value `c`. This is achieved using a list comprehension that creates a list of length `a`, with each element being a sublist of length `b`, where every element in these sublists is the value `c`. There are no edge cases to consider since `a` and `b` are guaranteed to be non-negative integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: listOfTuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains exactly two non-negative integers representing the number of plays and clears at a certain moment. idx is an integer that specifies the index of the element in the tuple to be used for sorting (0 for plays, 1 for clears).
def sortListWithIndex(listOfTuples, idx):
    return sorted(listOfTuples, key=lambda x: x[idx])
    #`listOfTuples` is sorted based on the idx-th element of each tuple, where idx is 0 for plays or 1 for clears
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `sortListWithIndex` accepts a list of tuples `listOfTuples`, where each tuple contains exactly two non-negative integers representing the number of plays and clears at a certain moment, and an integer `idx` specifying the index of the element in the tuple to be used for sorting (0 for plays or 1 for clears). The function returns a new list of tuples that is sorted based on the `idx`-th element of each tuple. The original `listOfTuples` remains unchanged. Potential edge cases include empty lists or `listOfTuples` containing tuples with less than two elements, which would raise a `TypeError`. However, the function does not explicitly handle these cases, so the behavior in such scenarios is undefined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: passedDic is a dictionary where the keys are integers representing the moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats, and the values are tuples (p_i, c_i) where p_i is the number of plays and c_i is the number of clears at that moment of time. The dictionary is assumed to be in chronological order.
def sortDictWithVal(passedDic):
    temp = sorted(passedDic.items(), key=lambda kv: (kv[1], kv[0]))
    toret = {}
    for tup in temp:
        toret[tup[0]] = tup[1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `passedDic` is a dictionary where the keys are integers representing the moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats, and the values are tuples (p_i, c_i) where p_i is the number of plays and c_i is the number of clears at that moment of time; `temp` is a sorted list of items from `passedDic` based on the criteria specified by the lambda function; `toret` is a dictionary containing all key-value pairs where the keys are the first elements of the tuples in `temp` and the values are the second elements of the same tuples.
    return toret
    #`thetoret` is a dictionary containing all key-value pairs where the keys are the first elements of the tuples in `temp` and the values are the second elements of the same tuples
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `sortDictWithVal` takes a dictionary `passedDic` as input, sorts its items based on the criteria specified by the lambda function (first by the tuple values, then by the keys if the values are equal), and returns a new dictionary `toret`. This new dictionary contains the same key-value pairs as the sorted items from `temp`, where each key is the first element of the tuple and each value is the second element of the corresponding tuple in `temp`. The function handles the case where multiple entries might have the same values, ensuring the correct sorting order based on the keys. The returned dictionary maintains the sorted order of the original entries as determined by the lambda function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: passedDic is a dictionary where the keys are integers representing the moment of time Polycarp peeked at the stats, and the values are tuples of two integers (p, c) where p is the number of plays and c is the number of clears at that moment. The dictionary is sorted in ascending order of the keys.
def sortDictWithKey(passedDic):
    return dict(OrderedDict(sorted(passedDic.items())))
    #The program returns a dictionary where the keys are integers representing the moment of time Polycarp peeked at the stats, and the values are tuples of two integers (p, c) where p is the number of plays and c is the number of clears at that moment. The dictionary is sorted in ascending order of the keys
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `sortDictWithKey` accepts a dictionary `passedDic` where the keys are integers representing the moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats, and the values are tuples containing two integers `(p, c)` where `p` is the number of plays and `c` is the number of clears at that moment. The function ensures that the returned dictionary maintains the same structure but guarantees that its keys are sorted in ascending order. This is achieved by converting the dictionary to an `OrderedDict`, sorting its items, and then converting it back to a dictionary. The function does not modify the original dictionary but returns a new one with the sorted keys.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not relate to the problem description provided. The function takes no parameters and seems to be unrelated to checking the correctness of level stats in the game Berlio Maker 85. It appears to read input from stdin, process it, and return a list of integers. Given the context, this function should not be considered part of solving the described problem.
def func_2(zero):

    try:
        while True:
            if s[i] >= b'0'[0]:
                numb = 10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48

    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: `A` is a list of integers, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, `i` is the length of `s`, and the state is unknown due to the empty `except` block.
    if (s and s[-1] >= b'0'[0]) :

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is a list of integers with an additional element 0, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, `i` is the length of `s`. If the last character of the non-empty byte string `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part provided.
    return A
    #The program returns the list `A` which contains an additional element 0
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_2` takes a parameter `zero` (although it is not used in the function), reads a byte string from standard input, processes it to convert characters to integers, and appends the resulting integers to a list `A`. After processing, the function appends an additional element `0` to the list `A` and returns it. 

- The function reads a byte string `s` from standard input.
- It initializes `numb` to `zero` and `sign` to `1`.
- It iterates over each character in `s`, converting digits to integers and appending them to `A` with the appropriate sign.
- If a `-` character is encountered, it sets `sign` to `-1`.
- If a newline character (`\r`) is not encountered, it appends the current number (`numb`) to `A` with the current sign and resets `numb` and `sign`.
- After the loop, if the last character of `s` is a digit, it appends the final number to `A`.
- Finally, the function returns the list `A` with an additional element `0` appended to it.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle non-digit characters other than `-` and `\r` explicitly. Characters other than digits, `-`, and `\r` are ignored.
- The function assumes that the input is a valid byte string. If the input is not a byte string, the function may raise a `TypeError`.
- The function uses `sys.stdin.buffer.read()` to read the entire input at once, which could potentially cause issues with very large inputs.
- The function does not provide feedback or error handling for invalid input, such as non-byte string input or improperly formatted data.
