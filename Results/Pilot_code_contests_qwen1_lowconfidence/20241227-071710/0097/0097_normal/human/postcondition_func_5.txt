The function `list2d` accepts three parameters: `a` (the number of rows), `b` (the number of columns), and `c` (the value to fill in the 2D list). It returns a 2D list (an `a x b` matrix) where each element is set to the value `c`. This is achieved using a list comprehension that creates a list of length `a`, with each element being a sublist of length `b`, where every element in these sublists is the value `c`. There are no edge cases to consider since `a` and `b` are guaranteed to be non-negative integers.
