Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case when `n = 3`. According to the annotations, the loop starts from 0, which results in `i = 0` and `n - i = 3`, leading to the print statement "0 3". However, according to the problem description, for `n = 3`, the correct output should be "1 2" because the only proper irreducible fraction with a sum of 3 is \( \frac{1}{2} \). The annotated version confirms that the loop should start from 1 to ensure both the numerator and denominator are positive integers and coprime, but the current implementation does not account for this. Therefore, the program is not fully correct based on the problem description.
