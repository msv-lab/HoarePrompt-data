You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya is a big fan of mathematics, especially its part related to fractions. Recently he learned that a fraction <image> is called proper iff its numerator is smaller than its denominator (a < b) and that the fraction is called irreducible if its numerator and its denominator are coprime (they do not have positive common divisors except 1).

During his free time, Petya thinks about proper irreducible fractions and converts them to decimals using the calculator. One day he mistakenly pressed addition button ( + ) instead of division button (÷) and got sum of numerator and denominator that was equal to n instead of the expected decimal notation. 

Petya wanted to restore the original fraction, but soon he realized that it might not be done uniquely. That's why he decided to determine maximum possible proper irreducible fraction <image> such that sum of its numerator and denominator equals n. Help Petya deal with this problem.

Input

In the only line of input there is an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the sum of numerator and denominator of the fraction.

Output

Output two space-separated positive integers a and b, numerator and denominator of the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction satisfying the given sum.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the greatest common divisor (gcd) check is not strict enough for finding the maximum proper irreducible fraction. Specifically, the program iterates through possible values of the numerator `i` and checks if `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`. However, this approach may miss the correct fraction when the gcd condition is not met due to the way the loop is structured.

For example, consider the input `n = 12`. The program outputs `5 7`, which is correct. However, for other inputs like `n = 13`, the program would output `6 7`, which is also a valid proper irreducible fraction, but not necessarily the maximum one. A more rigorous approach is needed to ensure that the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction is found.

To fix this, we should ensure that we are checking all possible pairs and selecting the one with the largest numerator while maintaining the irreducibility condition. Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_numerator = 0
    max_denominator = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2):
        j = n - i
        if gcd(i, j) == 1:
            if i > max_numerator:
                max_numerator = i
                max_denominator = j
    print(f"{max_numerator} {max_denominator}")


func()
```

This version ensures that we are checking all possible pairs and selecting the one with the largest numerator while maintaining the irreducibility condition.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from fractions import gcd

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(n / 2):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:
            print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is the largest integer in the range `[0, n/2]` for which `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`, `n - i` is the corresponding value, and `n` is an integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000. If no such `i` exists, `i` is 0 and `n - i` is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 1000 \)) as input, iterates over the range from 0 to \( n/2 \), and prints pairs of integers \((i, n-i)\) where \( i \) and \( n-i \) are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). After the loop, the function ends without returning any value. If no pair \((i, n-i)\) satisfying the condition is found, the loop simply completes without printing anything.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
