Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The function is designed to find pairs \((i, n-i)\) where \(i\) and \(n-i\) are coprime, but it prints all such pairs without ensuring that the fraction \(\frac{i}{n-i}\) is the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction. According to the problem description, we need to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction such that the sum of its numerator and denominator equals \(n\). However, the current implementation prints multiple pairs, including those that do not yield the maximum fraction.

For example, consider the input \(n = 12\):
- The correct output should be \(5\) and \(7\) because \(\frac{5}{7}\) is the maximum proper irreducible fraction with a sum of \(12\).
- However, the code will print multiple pairs like \((1, 11)\), \((2, 10)\), \((3, 9)\), etc., which do not yield the maximum fraction.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that it finds and prints the pair \((i, n-i)\) that results in the largest proper irreducible fraction.
