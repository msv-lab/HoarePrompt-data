Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction such that the sum of its numerator and denominator equals `n`. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Range for `i`:**
   - The program uses a loop that iterates from `0` to `n // 2`. While this range is generally correct because the numerator should be less than the denominator, it does not ensure that the fraction is irreducible for all cases.
   
2. **Checking Irreducibility:**
   - The program checks if `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` to ensure the fraction is irreducible. However, the loop should iterate from `1` to `n // 2 - 1` because `i` represents the numerator, and `n - i` represents the denominator. The numerator cannot be `0` or `n`, as those would not form a proper fraction.

3. **Finding the Maximum Proper Fraction:**
   - The loop should start from `1` to `n // 2 - 1` to ensure the numerator is the largest possible value that is still less than the denominator and coprime with the denominator.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_fraction = (0, 0)
    
    for i in range(1, n // 2):
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:
            if i > max_fraction[0]:
                max_fraction = (i, n - i)
                
    print(max_fraction[0], max_fraction[1])

# State of the program after the function call: 
# `max_fraction` contains the numerator and denominator of the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction
# such that the sum of its numerator and denominator equals `n`.
```

In this corrected version:
- The loop starts from `1` to `n // 2 - 1` to ensure the numerator is properly less than the denominator.
- The variable `max_fraction` keeps track of the largest proper irreducible fraction found during the iteration.
- The final result is printed after the loop completes, ensuring that the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction is returned.
