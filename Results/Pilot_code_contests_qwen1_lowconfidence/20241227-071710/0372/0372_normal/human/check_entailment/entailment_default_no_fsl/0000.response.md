Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code only prints the first pair of coprime numbers \((i, n-i)\) it finds during the iteration, but it does not ensure that the fraction \(\frac{i}{n-i}\) is proper (i.e., \(i < n-i\)). For some values of \(n\), the code might return an improper fraction, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

For example, consider \(n = 6\):
- The code would check pairs (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3).
- It would find \((1, 5)\) as the first pair where \(\gcd(1, 5) = 1\), but it would print this even though \(\frac{1}{5}\) is a proper fraction.
- However, \(\frac{3}{3}\) is also a valid proper irreducible fraction with \(3 + 3 = 6\), and it is larger than \(\frac{1}{5}\).

Therefore, the code does not always return the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction.
