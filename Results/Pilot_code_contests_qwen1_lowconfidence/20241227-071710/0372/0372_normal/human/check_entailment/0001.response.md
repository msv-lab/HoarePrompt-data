Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the greatest common divisor (gcd) check is not strict enough for finding the maximum proper irreducible fraction. Specifically, the program iterates through possible values of the numerator `i` and checks if `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`. However, this approach may miss the correct fraction when the gcd condition is not met due to the way the loop is structured.

For example, consider the input `n = 12`. The program outputs `5 7`, which is correct. However, for other inputs like `n = 13`, the program would output `6 7`, which is also a valid proper irreducible fraction, but not necessarily the maximum one. A more rigorous approach is needed to ensure that the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction is found.

To fix this, we should ensure that we are checking all possible pairs and selecting the one with the largest numerator while maintaining the irreducibility condition. Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_numerator = 0
    max_denominator = 0
    for i in range(1, n // 2):
        j = n - i
        if gcd(i, j) == 1:
            if i > max_numerator:
                max_numerator = i
                max_denominator = j
    print(f"{max_numerator} {max_denominator}")


func()
```

This version ensures that we are checking all possible pairs and selecting the one with the largest numerator while maintaining the irreducibility condition.
