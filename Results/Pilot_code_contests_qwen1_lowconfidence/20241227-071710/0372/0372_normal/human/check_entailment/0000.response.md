Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is 3 properly. According to the problem description, for `n = 3`, the output should be "1 2" because the only proper irreducible fraction with a sum of 3 is \( \frac{1}{2} \). However, the program starts the loop from 0, which results in `i = 0` and `n - i = 3`, and since `gcd(3, 0)` is undefined (and would raise an error in practice), it prints "0 3" instead of "1 2".

To fix this, the loop should start from 1 to ensure that both numerator and denominator are positive integers and coprime.
