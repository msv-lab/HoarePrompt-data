Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction whose numerator and denominator sum to \( n \). Here's why:

1. **Proper Fraction**: The problem specifies that the fraction should be proper, meaning the numerator must be less than the denominator (\( a < b \)). However, the current implementation does not ensure this. It iterates through all possible values from 0 to \( n/2 \) and checks for coprimality but does not enforce \( a < b \).

2. **Irreducibility**: The program correctly checks for coprimality using the `gcd` function, ensuring that the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator is 1. This part is correct.

3. **Maximizing the Fraction**: The program does not ensure that the fraction is maximized. For a given sum \( n \), the goal is to find the pair \((a, b)\) such that \( a + b = n \) and \( a/b \) is maximized while still being a proper irreducible fraction. The current approach only checks for coprimality without ensuring the fraction is maximized.

To fix this, the program should iterate from \( n/2 - 1 \) down to 1 (ensuring \( a < b \)) and find the first pair that is coprime. Hereâ€™s how the corrected version might look:

```python
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input())  # Use input() instead of raw_input() for Python 3 compatibility
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, 0, -1):  # Start from n//2-1 and go down to 1
        if gcd(n - i, i) == 1:  # Check if the fraction is irreducible
            print(str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i))
            break  # Once the correct pair is found, exit the loop
```

This corrected version ensures that the numerator \( a \) is less than the denominator \( b \) and finds the maximum possible proper irreducible fraction satisfying the given sum.
