The function takes an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 1000 \)) as input, iterates over the range from 0 to \( n/2 \), and prints pairs of integers \((i, n-i)\) where \( i \) and \( n-i \) are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). After the loop, the function ends without returning any value. If no pair \((i, n-i)\) satisfying the condition is found, the loop simply completes without printing anything.
