The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func():`. The parameter constraints provided (n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000) do not apply since no parameter is listed in the function definition. 

Given the output cases are not provided directly but rather constraints on a potential parameter, and since no output is specified, we can infer that the function might internally use such a parameter but it is not passed as an argument to the function.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return a value based on some internal logic involving an integer `n` within the range 3 to 1000, though the exact nature of the return value or the internal logic is not specified.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on an internal integer `n` within the range 3 to 1000.**
