Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
   - The condition for printing the output is `gcd(n - 1, 1) == 1`, but this condition is always true because the greatest common divisor (gcd) of any number and 1 is always 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n / 2 - 1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, the loop has already run once, so `i` should now be 2.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n / 2`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute again if `n / 2` is greater than 2, which means `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `i` should be 2.
   - `n` must be an integer within the range 4 ≤ n ≤ 1000 (since the loop will continue only if `n / 2 > 2`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer within the range 4 ≤ n ≤ 1000**
