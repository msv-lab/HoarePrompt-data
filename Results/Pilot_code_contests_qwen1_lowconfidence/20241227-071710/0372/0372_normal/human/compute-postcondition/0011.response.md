To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Initialization and Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n/2`.
   - The condition inside the loop checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n - i` and `i` is 1.

2. **Execution Flow**:
   - For each iteration, the loop checks the condition `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`.
   - If the condition is met, the values of `i` and `n - i` are printed.

3. **Final Iteration Analysis**:
   - The loop will continue to run until the condition `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` fails for all possible values of `i` in the range from `0` to `n/2`.

### Conclusion

- **Case 1: Loop Executes at Least Once**:
  - If the loop executes at least once, there exists at least one pair `(i, n - i)` such that `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`.
  - After the loop finishes, the value of `i` will be the last value for which the condition was true, and `n - i` will be the corresponding value.

- **Case 2: Loop Does Not Execute**:
  - If the loop does not execute at all, it means that for all values of `i` from `0` to `n/2`, the condition `gcd(n - i, i) != 1` holds true.
  - In this case, the values of `i` and `n - i` will remain `0` and `n`, respectively, because the loop never increments `i` beyond `0`.

### Final Output State

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished.

Output State: **`i` is the largest integer in the range `[0, n/2]` for which `gcd(n - i, i) == 1`, `n - i` is the corresponding value, and `n` is an integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000. If no such `i` exists, `i` is 0 and `n - i` is `n`.**
