The code assigns the value of `int(raw_input())` to `n`. Since `raw_input()` reads a line from input and returns it as a string, and `int()` converts this string to an integer, `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000 is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user, and 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000**
