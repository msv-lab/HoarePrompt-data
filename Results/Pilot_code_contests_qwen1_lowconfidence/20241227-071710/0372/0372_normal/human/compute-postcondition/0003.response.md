The code prints the string concatenation of `i` and `n - i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000, the expression `str(i) + ' ' + str(n - i)` evaluates to `'0 ' + str(n)`, which results in the string `'0 n'` being printed. 

However, since the output of the print statement is not stored in any variable and does not affect the state of any variables, the only change is the side effect of printing the string. The variables `i` and `n` retain their original values.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000**
