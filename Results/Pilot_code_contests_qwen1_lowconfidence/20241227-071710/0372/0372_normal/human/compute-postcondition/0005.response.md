Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - The loop condition `gcd(n - i, i) == 1` is checked.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n/2 - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

3. **GCD Check**:
   - When `i` is 0, the GCD check is `gcd(n - 0, 0) = gcd(n, 0)`.
   - Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, `gcd(n, 0)` is always `n`.
   - For `i = 0`, the condition `gcd(n - 0, 0) == 1` simplifies to `n == 1`, but since `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\), this condition is never true for any valid `n`.

Given that the GCD condition is not satisfied for `i = 0`, the loop will still proceed to the next value of `i` regardless of the GCD condition. This means that the loop will execute again with `i` set to 1.

4. **Adjusted State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same, as the loop condition does not depend on `n` changing.
   - The GCD condition will now check `gcd(n - 1, 1)`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000**.
