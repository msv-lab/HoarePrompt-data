The given code simply prints the sum of `i` and `n - i`. Since the values of `i` and `n` are not modified by this line of code, the output is just a string concatenation of their current values. The initial state is that `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer within the range 4 ≤ n ≤ 1000. The code does not change these values, so they remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is an integer within the range 4 ≤ n ≤ 1000; print output is '2 ' followed by the value of `n - 2`**
