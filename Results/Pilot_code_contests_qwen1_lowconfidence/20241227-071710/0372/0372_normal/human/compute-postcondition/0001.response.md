State: **`n` must be an integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `i` is 0**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n / 2`.
2. **Range Calculation**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n / 2` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Minimum Value of `n`**: Since `n` must be at least 3 (as given by the constraint `3 ≤ n ≤ 1000`), `n / 2` will be at least 1.5, ensuring that the loop can execute at least once if `n` is 3 or more.
4. **Initial Value of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `n` is an integer within the specified range, and `i` starts at 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.
