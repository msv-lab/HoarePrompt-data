The code prints the concatenation of the string representation of `i` and a space followed by the string representation of `n - i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` remains unchanged because the code only prints the values and does not assign any new values to the variables. 

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and the output is printed as '1' + ' ' + str(n - 1)**
