The code assigns the value of `x` to the variable `a`. The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `a` is undefined initially.
- `x` is the second element of the list `L`.

After executing the line `a = x`, the value of `a` is updated to the value of `x`, while the values of `N`, `X`, `L`, `n`, `x`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is equal to `n`; `a` is the second element of `L` (`x`).**
