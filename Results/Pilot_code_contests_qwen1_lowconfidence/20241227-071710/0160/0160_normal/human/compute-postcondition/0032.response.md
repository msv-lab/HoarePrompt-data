Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is updated based on the following conditions: if `a > b`, `res` is `res + 2 * x`; otherwise, `res` is updated to `res + x` and `a` is set to `x`, `b` is `n - x`, and `flag` remains `False`.***
