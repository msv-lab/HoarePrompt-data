Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is equal to `n`; `a` is the second element of `L` (`x`); `b` is `n - x`; `flag` is `True`; \(a \geq b\)**
