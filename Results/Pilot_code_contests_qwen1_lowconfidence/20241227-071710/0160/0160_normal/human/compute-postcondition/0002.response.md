`x` is assigned the value of the second element in the list `L`. The first element of the list `L` is still `n`, and the other elements of the list remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`.**
