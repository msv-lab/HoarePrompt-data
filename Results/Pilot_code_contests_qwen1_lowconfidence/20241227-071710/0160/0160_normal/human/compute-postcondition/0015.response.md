The code `b -= q * a` updates the value of `b` by subtracting `q * a` from its current value. Let's break down the steps:

1. Initially, `b` is defined as `n - x`.
2. `q` is defined as `(n - x) // x`.

Given these definitions, we can substitute the expressions into the equation for `b`:

- `b` initially is `n - x`.
- `q` is `(n - x) // x`.

Therefore, `b -= q * a` becomes:
\[ b = (n - x) - ((n - x) // x) * a \]

Since `a` is equal to `x`, we can further simplify this to:
\[ b = (n - x) - ((n - x) // x) * x \]

This simplifies to:
\[ b = (n - x) - (n - x) \]
\[ b = 0 \]

The other variables remain unchanged. So, the updated states are:

- `n` remains the first element of `L`.
- `x` remains the second element of `L`.
- `res` remains equal to `n`.
- `a` remains equal to `x`.
- `b` is now `0`.
- `flag` remains `True`.
- `q` remains `(n - x) // x`.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `L`, `x` is the second element of `L`, `res` is equal to `n`, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is `0`, `flag` is `True`, `q` is `(n - x) // x`.**
