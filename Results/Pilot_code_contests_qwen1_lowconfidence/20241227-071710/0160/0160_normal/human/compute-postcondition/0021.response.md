Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is updated based on the following conditions: if `a > b`, then `res` is `3n - 2x`; otherwise, `res` is `2n - x`; `a` is the second element of `L` (`x`); `b` is `n - x`; `flag` is `True` if `b > a`, otherwise `flag` is `False`.**
