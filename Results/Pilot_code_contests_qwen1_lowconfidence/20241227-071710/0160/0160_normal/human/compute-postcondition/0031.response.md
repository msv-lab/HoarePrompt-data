Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is updated based on the following conditions: if `b > a`, `res` is updated by adding `2 * x * (n - x) // x` to its current value; otherwise, `res` is updated to `res + x`; `a` is `x`; `b` is `n - x`; `flag` remains `False`**.
