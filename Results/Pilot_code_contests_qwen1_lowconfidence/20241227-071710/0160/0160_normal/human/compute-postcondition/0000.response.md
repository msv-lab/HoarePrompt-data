The code `L = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `L`. Since the input is split and converted to integers, `L` will contain the integers from the input line.

The initial states are:
- `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\)
- `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\)

After executing the code, the variables `N` and `X` remain unchanged, but a new variable `L` is introduced and populated with integers from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1`; `L` is a list of integers from the input line**
