Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers with `n` as the first element and `x` as the second element; `res` is updated based on the following conditions: if `b > a`, `res` is updated to `res + 2 * x`; otherwise, `res` is updated to `res + a` and `b` is updated to `b - (b // a) * a`. `flag` remains `False`.**
