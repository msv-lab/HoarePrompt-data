`res` is initially equal to `n`. The code `res += 2 * a * q` updates the value of `res` by adding `2 * a * q` to its current value. Given that `a` is equal to `x`, and `q` is equal to `(n - x) // x`, we can substitute these values into the equation.

Let's break it down:

1. `a` is `x`.
2. `q` is `(n - x) // x`.

So, `2 * a * q` becomes `2 * x * ((n - x) // x)`.

Simplifying this expression:
- `(n - x) // x` gives the integer division of `(n - x)` by `x`, which results in an integer value.
- Multiplying this result by `2 * x` gives us `2 * (n - x)` since `(n - x) // x` effectively cancels out one `x` from the numerator.

Thus, `res` becomes `res + 2 * (n - x)`. Given that `res` was initially equal to `n`, the new value of `res` is `n + 2 * (n - x)`.

Let's express the final values:

- `res` is now `n + 2 * (n - x)`, which simplifies to `3 * n - 2 * x`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `b`, `flag`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `L`, `x` is the second element of `L`, `res` is `3 * n - 2 * x`, `a` is equal to `x`, `b` is `0`, `flag` is `True`, `q` is `(n - x) // x`.**
