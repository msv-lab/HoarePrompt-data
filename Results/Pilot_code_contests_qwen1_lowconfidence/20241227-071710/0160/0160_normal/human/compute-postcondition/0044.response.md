Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\); `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\); `L` is a list of integers; `n` is the first element of `L`; `x` is the second element of `L`; `res` is the final result of the loop calculations; `a` is the final value of the second element of `L` (`x`); `b` is the final value of `n - x`; `flag` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the first element of `L`.
   - `x` is the second element of `L`.
   - `res` is initialized to `n`.
   - `a` is `x`.
   - `b` is `n - x`.
   - `flag` is `True`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `flag` is `True`.
   - Inside the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on their relative sizes, and `res` is updated accordingly.
   - The loop terminates when either `a` equals `b` or one of them becomes zero.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop, `a` and `b` will eventually become equal (or one of them will be zero).
   - If `a` equals `b`, the final `res` will be `res + a`.
   - If one of them becomes zero, the loop will exit and `res` will be updated to its last calculated value.
   - `flag` will be `False` after the loop exits.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop will terminate when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `x` is found.
   - The final value of `res` will be the sum of multiples of the GCD, depending on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `a` and `b` will be the GCD of `n` and `x`.
   - `flag` will be `False` indicating the loop has completed.

Thus, after all iterations, the output state is as described above.
