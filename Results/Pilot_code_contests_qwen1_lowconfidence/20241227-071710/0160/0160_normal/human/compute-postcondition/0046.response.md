The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the function definition `def func():`. The parameter constraints provided (N is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\) and X is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\)) do not apply within the function itself but rather define the valid range for potential inputs to the function.

Since no parameters are accepted by the function and no output cases are specified directly within the given constraints, the function's behavior cannot be accurately described without additional information about its intended functionality.

However, based on the constraints provided, if we were to hypothesize the possible outputs, it might involve operations using N and X within the defined ranges. But without explicit instructions or return conditions, the most accurate description is:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters.**
