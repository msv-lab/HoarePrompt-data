Postcondition: ***`n` is the first element of `L`, `x` is the second element of `L`, `res` is updated as follows: if `b > a`, then `res` is `3 * n - 2 * x`; otherwise, `res` is `2 * n - x`. `a` is the second element of `L` (`x`), `b` is `n - x`, `flag` is `True` if `b > a`, otherwise `flag` is `False`.***
