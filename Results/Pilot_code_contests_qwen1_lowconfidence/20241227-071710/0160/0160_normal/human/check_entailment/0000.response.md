Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the total length of the ray's trajectory for all possible inputs. Specifically, the logic in the `while` loop does not properly handle the cases where `a` and `b` are not equal, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `N = 7` and `X = 4`. According to the problem description, the ray should eventually come back to the rifle and the total length of the ray's trajectory should be calculated correctly. However, the given program fails to handle this case accurately.

Here is a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initial Values**: `n = 7`, `x = 4`, so `a = 4` and `b = 3`.
2. **First Iteration**:
   - `a > b`, so `q = a // b = 4 // 3 = 1`, `a -= q * b = 4 - 3 = 1`, `res += 2 * q * b = res + 6`.
   - Updated values: `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `res = 7`.

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - `b > a`, so `q = b // a = 3 // 1 = 3`, `b -= q * a = 3 - 3 = 0`, `res += 2 * a * q = res + 6`.
   - Updated values: `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `res = 13`.

4. **Final Iteration**:
   - `else` block: `res += a = 13 + 1 = 14`.
   - Flag becomes `False`.

The final result is `14`, which is incorrect. The correct length of the ray's trajectory for `N = 7` and `X = 4` should be `18`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, making it incorrect.
