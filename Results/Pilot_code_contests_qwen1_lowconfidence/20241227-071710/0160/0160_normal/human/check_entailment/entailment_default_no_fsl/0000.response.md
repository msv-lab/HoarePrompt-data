Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The code uses a while loop to reduce \(N\) and \(X\) using division and subtraction until they become equal, but this approach does not accurately model the behavior of the ray reflecting off the mirrors and its own trajectory. 

The problem requires calculating the total length of the ray's trajectory, which involves complex reflections and should not be simplified by just reducing \(N\) and \(X\) until they are equal. The provided solution does not account for the multiple reflections and the fact that the ray continues to reflect until it eventually returns to the starting point.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as understanding the periodicity of the reflections and using mathematical properties of the equilateral triangle and the ray's path. The current implementation does not handle all potential cases and will not produce the correct output for all inputs.
