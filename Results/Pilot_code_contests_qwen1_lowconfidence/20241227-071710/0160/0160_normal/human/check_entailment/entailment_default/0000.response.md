Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary reflection of the ray of Mysterious Light within the equilateral triangle formed by the mirrors. The program logic does not accurately simulate the reflections and the total length of the ray's trajectory. Specifically, the while loop and the conditions inside it do not properly account for the multiple reflections and the eventual return of the ray to the rifle.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to understand that the ray will reflect off the mirrors in a way that effectively "folds" the triangle. The total length of the ray's trajectory can be calculated using the properties of the equilateral triangle and the placement of the rifle. The given program does not correctly handle these properties and the edge cases, such as when \(N\) and \(X\) are such that the ray reflects multiple times before returning to the rifle.

A correct solution would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of \(N\) and \(X\) and then using it to determine the total length of the ray's trajectory. The provided code does not implement this logic and thus fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
