Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads two integers \(N\) and \(X\) from standard input. This matches the problem description which states that the input should be two integers \(N\) and \(X\).

2. **Initial Variables**: The program initializes variables \(n\) and \(x\) with the values read from input. It also initializes \(res\) to \(n\) and sets up variables \(a\) and \(b\) to represent \(x\) and \(n - x\) respectively. This setup is consistent with the initial state described in the problem.

3. **Loop Logic**: The program enters a loop where it repeatedly reduces \(a\) and \(b\) using integer division and subtraction. Specifically:
   - If \(a > b\), it performs \(a = a - q \cdot b\) and updates \(res\) with \(res + 2 \cdot q \cdot b\).
   - If \(b > a\), it performs \(b = b - q \cdot a\) and updates \(res\) with \(res + 2 \cdot a \cdot q\).
   - If \(a = b\), the loop terminates, and \(res\) is updated with the remaining value of \(a\).

4. **Final Output**: The program prints the value of \(res\), which represents the total length of the ray's trajectory. This matches the problem statement which requires the total length to be printed.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where \(N\) and \(X\) are such that one is always larger than the other during the iterations. It also correctly handles the case where \(N\) and \(X\) are equal initially, in which case the result is simply \(N\).

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, including all necessary conditions and edge cases, it is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
