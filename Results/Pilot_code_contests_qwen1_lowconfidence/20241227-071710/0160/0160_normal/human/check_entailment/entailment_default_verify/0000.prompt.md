You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Snuke is conducting an optical experiment using mirrors and his new invention, the rifle of Mysterious Light.

Three mirrors of length N are set so that they form an equilateral triangle. Let the vertices of the triangle be a, b and c.

Inside the triangle, the rifle is placed at the point p on segment ab such that ap = X. (The size of the rifle is negligible.) Now, the rifle is about to fire a ray of Mysterious Light in the direction of bc.

The ray of Mysterious Light will travel in a straight line, and will be reflected by mirrors, in the same ways as "ordinary" light. There is one major difference, though: it will be also reflected by its own trajectory as if it is a mirror! When the ray comes back to the rifle, the ray will be absorbed.

The following image shows the ray's trajectory where N = 5 and X = 2.

It can be shown that the ray eventually comes back to the rifle and is absorbed, regardless of the values of N and X. Find the total length of the ray's trajectory.

Constraints

* 2≦N≦10^{12}
* 1≦X≦N-1
* N and X are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N X


Output

Print the total length of the ray's trajectory.

Example

Input

Output

12
Program:
```
def func():
    L = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    res = n
    a = x
    b = n - x
    flag = True
    while flag:
        if a > b:
            q = a // b
            a -= q * b
            res += 2 * q * b
        elif b > a:
            q = b // a
            b -= q * a
            res += 2 * a * q
        else:
            res += a
            flag = False
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the total length of the ray's trajectory for all possible inputs. Specifically, the logic in the `while` loop does not properly handle the cases where `a` and `b` are not equal, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `N = 7` and `X = 4`. According to the problem description, the ray should eventually come back to the rifle and the total length of the ray's trajectory should be calculated correctly. However, the given program fails to handle this case accurately.

Here is a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initial Values**: `n = 7`, `x = 4`, so `a = 4` and `b = 3`.
2. **First Iteration**:
   - `a > b`, so `q = a // b = 4 // 3 = 1`, `a -= q * b = 4 - 3 = 1`, `res += 2 * q * b = res + 6`.
   - Updated values: `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `res = 7`.

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - `b > a`, so `q = b // a = 3 // 1 = 3`, `b -= q * a = 3 - 3 = 0`, `res += 2 * a * q = res + 6`.
   - Updated values: `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `res = 13`.

4. **Final Iteration**:
   - `else` block: `res += a = 13 + 1 = 14`.
   - Flag becomes `False`.

The final result is `14`, which is incorrect. The correct length of the ray's trajectory for `N = 7` and `X = 4` should be `18`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers \(N\) and \(X\) from the standard input, where \(2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}\) and \(1 \leq X \leq N-1\). It then calculates a result based on a series of operations involving \(N\), \(X\), and their differences. Specifically, it repeatedly reduces \(N\) and \(X\) using division and subtraction until they become equal, updating the result accordingly. The final result is printed to the standard output. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. Potential edge cases include when \(N\) and \(X\) are equal initially, in which case the result is simply \(N\). The function also handles the case where \(N\) and \(X\) are such that one is always larger than the other during the iterations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
