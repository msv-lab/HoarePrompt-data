Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the total length of the ray's trajectory for all possible inputs. Specifically, the logic in the `while` loop does not properly handle the cases where `a` and `b` are not equal, leading to incorrect results. For example, the input `N = 7` and `X = 4` should yield a result of `18`, but the program outputs `14`. This discrepancy indicates that the program's implementation is flawed, and it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The output hints also confirm that the program has issues with handling the reduction of `N` and `X` correctly, further supporting the original assessment.
