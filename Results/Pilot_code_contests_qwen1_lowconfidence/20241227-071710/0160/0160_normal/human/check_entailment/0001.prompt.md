You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Snuke is conducting an optical experiment using mirrors and his new invention, the rifle of Mysterious Light.

Three mirrors of length N are set so that they form an equilateral triangle. Let the vertices of the triangle be a, b and c.

Inside the triangle, the rifle is placed at the point p on segment ab such that ap = X. (The size of the rifle is negligible.) Now, the rifle is about to fire a ray of Mysterious Light in the direction of bc.

The ray of Mysterious Light will travel in a straight line, and will be reflected by mirrors, in the same ways as "ordinary" light. There is one major difference, though: it will be also reflected by its own trajectory as if it is a mirror! When the ray comes back to the rifle, the ray will be absorbed.

The following image shows the ray's trajectory where N = 5 and X = 2.

It can be shown that the ray eventually comes back to the rifle and is absorbed, regardless of the values of N and X. Find the total length of the ray's trajectory.

Constraints

* 2≦N≦10^{12}
* 1≦X≦N-1
* N and X are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N X


Output

Print the total length of the ray's trajectory.

Example

Input

5 2


Output

12
Program:
```
def func():
    L = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    res = n
    a = x
    b = n - x
    flag = True
    while flag:
        if a > b:
            q = a // b
            a -= q * b
            res += 2 * q * b
        elif b > a:
            q = b // a
            b -= q * a
            res += 2 * a * q
        else:
            res += a
            flag = False
    print(res)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
