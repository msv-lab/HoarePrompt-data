Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The functions defined do not contain the necessary logic to restore the permutation based on the given `s` values. Specifically:

1. The code does not define the main function that processes the input and prints the restored permutation.
2. There is no logic to iterate through the `s` values and construct the permutation based on the given rules.
3. Functions like `func_6` and `func_7` suggest the use of a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), but there is no clear indication of how this is used to solve the problem.
4. The code does not handle the restoration of the permutation based on the sum values `s_i`.

Given these observations, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
