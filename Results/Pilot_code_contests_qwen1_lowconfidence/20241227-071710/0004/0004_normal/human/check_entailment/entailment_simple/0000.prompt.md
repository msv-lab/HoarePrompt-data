You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
from itertools import permutations, combinations

raw_input = stdin.readline
pr = stdout.write
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
range = xrange
n = func_1()
BITTree = [0] * (n + 1)
l = func_2()
for i in range(n):
    func_7(i, i)
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    ans[i] = func_8(l[i])
    func_7(ans[i], -ans[i])
func_4(ans)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are present since the function does not take any parameters. However, the function reads input from the user using `raw_input()`, which is not part of the function's signature but is crucial for the program's operation. The input consists of the integer n followed by n integers representing the array s.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user followed by n integers representing the array s

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}). The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/2), representing the sums described in the problem statement.
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers read from the standard input, where the first line contains the number of integers to follow and the second line contains those integers

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and each s_i (where s_i is the i-th element of arr) satisfies 0 <= s_i <= (n*(n-1))/2, corresponding to a valid permutation of length n.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_5()` are defined in its signature, thus it does not have any explicit input parameters. The function reads input from `stdin`, processes it, and returns an iterator of integers.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns an iterator of integers read from standard input (stdin) and split based on spaces, with each element converted to an integer

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 1 <= i <= n, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) initialized with a length of n+1 containing non-negative integer values.
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `s` is the prefix sum up to the original value of `i` in the Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) `BITTree`, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) initialized with a length of `n+1` containing non-negative integer values.
    return s
    #The program returns s, which is the prefix sum up to the original value of i in the Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) BITTree

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i <= n, and v is an integer representing the value to be added to the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) at index i after adjusting i by adding 1.
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is greater than `n`, `BITTree[i-1]` is the cumulative effect of adding `v` at every position up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, where `i` was updated to the next power of 2 each time the loop executed.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n*(n-1))//2, n is a positive integer representing the size of the permutation, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (also known as a Fenwick Tree) that stores the cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index.
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing cumulative sums, `sm` is the sum of the values added to `sm` during the loop, `ret` is the maximum value such that `ret \leq n` and `sm + BITTree[ret] \leq x`.
    return ret
    #`The program returns ret, which is the maximum value such that ret ≤ n and sm + BITTree[ret] ≤ x`


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
