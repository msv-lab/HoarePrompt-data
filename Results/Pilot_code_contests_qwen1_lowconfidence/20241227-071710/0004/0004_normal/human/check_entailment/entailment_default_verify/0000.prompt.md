You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.

    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        i -= i & -i
    return s

#Function 7:
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        i += i & -i

#Function 8:
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
    return ret

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic required to restore the permutation based on the given conditions. Specifically, the functions defined in the program do not interact with the input in a way that would solve the problem. The program includes helper functions related to a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) but does not use them to calculate the permutation as described.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:

1. Parse the input to get the value of `n` and the array `s`.
2. Use the values in `s` to determine the permutation `p`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def restore_permutation(n, s):
    p = [0] * n
    p[0] = 1  # Start with the smallest number 1
    used = [False] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Find the smallest unused number that fits the condition
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if not used[j] and sum(p[k] for k in range(i) if p[k] < j) == s[i - 1]:
                p[i] = j
                used[j] = True
                break
    
    return p

# Reading input
n = int(input())
s = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Restoring the permutation
result = restore_permutation(n, s)

# Printing the result
print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version uses a straightforward approach to build the permutation by iterating through each position and finding the appropriate number based on the given conditions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), where `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the permutation, and `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) storing cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index. The function iterates backward through a range of bits from 21 to 0. During each iteration, it checks if adding \(2^i\) (where `i` is the current bit index) to `ret` and `BITTree[ret + 2^i]` to `sm` still satisfies the condition `sm + BITTree[ret + 2^i] <= x`. If the condition holds, it updates `ret` and `sm` accordingly. After the loop, the function returns `ret`, which is the maximum value such that `ret` ≤ `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret]` ≤ `x`. This ensures that `ret` is the largest possible value meeting the specified conditions.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
