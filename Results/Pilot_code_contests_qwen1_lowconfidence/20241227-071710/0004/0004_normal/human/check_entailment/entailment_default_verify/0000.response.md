Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not implement the logic required to restore the permutation based on the given conditions. The output hints describe a function (`func_8`) that is part of a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) implementation, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires constructing a permutation based on the given sums, but the provided code does not perform this task. Instead, it includes irrelevant functions like `func_6`, `func_7`, and `func_8` which deal with BIT operations without addressing the core problem. 

A correct solution involves iterating through each index and determining the appropriate value based on the given conditions, as shown in the corrected version provided. The current code does not include this necessary logic, making the program incorrect according to the problem description.
