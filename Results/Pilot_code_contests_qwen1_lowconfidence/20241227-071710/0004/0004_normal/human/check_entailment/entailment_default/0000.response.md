Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to restore the permutation based on the given sums. Specifically, the following issues are identified:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` and `func_2()` do not correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1()` concatenates the integer `n` and the array `s` into a single string, which is not needed and does not align with the requirement to read an array of integers `s`.

2. **Incorrect Use of BITTree**: The functions `func_6()` and `func_7()` are used to update and query a Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree), but the way they are used in the context of solving the problem is incorrect. The problem requires constructing a permutation based on the given sums, but the BITTree operations do not reflect the necessary logic for this construction.

3. **Incorrect Construction Logic**: The function `func_8()` is intended to find the correct permutation index based on the sums, but the logic inside `func_8()` is flawed. It does not correctly reconstruct the permutation from the given sums.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the required logic to restore the permutation. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
