You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An array of integers p_{1},p_{2}, …,p_{n} is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5] and [4,3,1,2]. The following arrays are not permutations: [2], [1,1], [2,3,4].

There is a hidden permutation of length n.

For each index i, you are given s_{i}, which equals to the sum of all p_{j} such that j < i and p_{j} < p_{i}. In other words, s_i is the sum of elements before the i-th element that are smaller than the i-th element.

Your task is to restore the permutation.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the size of the permutation.

The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/(2)).

It is guaranteed that the array s corresponds to a valid permutation of length n.

Output

Print n integers p_{1}, p_{2}, …, p_{n} — the elements of the restored permutation. We can show that the answer is always unique.

Examples

Input


3
0 0 0


Output


3 2 1


Input


2
0 1


Output


1 2


Input


5
0 1 1 1 10


Output


1 4 3 2 5

Note

In the first example for each i there is no index j satisfying both conditions, hence s_i are always 0.

In the second example for i = 2 it happens that j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = p_1.

In the third example for i = 2, 3, 4 only j = 1 satisfies the conditions, so s_2 = s_3 = s_4 = 1. For i = 5 all j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, so s_5 = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = 10.
Functions with output description for each function:
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
from itertools import permutations, combinations

raw_input = stdin.readline
pr = stdout.write
mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
range = xrange
n = func_1()
BITTree = [0] * (n + 1)
l = func_2()
for i in range(n):
    func_7(i, i)
ans = [0] * n
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    ans[i] = func_8(l[i])
    func_7(ans[i], -ans[i])
func_4(ans)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer input `n` from the user, followed by `n` additional integers representing an array `s`. It then returns these values as a single integer (the first input `n`) concatenated with the `n` integers from the array `s` as a string. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it relies on user input through `raw_input()` to proceed. The function does not perform any operations on the input values; it simply collects them and returns them in a specific format.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2()` reads input from standard input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It returns a map object containing these integers. This function assumes that the input is provided in the correct format: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers. If the input format is incorrect, the function will raise an error because `raw_input().split()` will not correctly parse the input. There are no explicit checks for the constraints on `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) or the values of the integers (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/2). After the function concludes, the program state will be such that the map object contains the integers read from the standard input.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It writes the integer `n` to standard output followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the integer `n` has been printed to the console.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a list `arr` of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is within the range `0 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and each element `s_i` in `arr` satisfies `0 <= s_i <= (n*(n-1))/2`, corresponding to a valid permutation of length `n`. After executing, the function prints the elements of `arr` separated by spaces followed by a newline character. There is no return value from the function.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5()` reads input from standard input (stdin), processes it by splitting the input based on spaces, converting each element to an integer, and returning an iterator of these integers. There are no explicit input parameters. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert the elements to integers. The function does not handle these cases, so an error might occur if the input does not consist solely of integers separated by spaces.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        i -= i & -i
    return s
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts an integer `i` as a parameter and returns the prefix sum up to the original value of `i` in the Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) `BITTree`. The function starts by incrementing `i` by 1. It then iterates using a while loop where it accumulates the sum of elements in `BITTree` from index `i` to the beginning of the tree, updating `i` by subtracting its largest leftmost set bit until `i` becomes 0. After the loop, the function returns the accumulated sum `s`. This process ensures that the returned value is the prefix sum up to the original value of `i` in the `BITTree`.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        i += i & -i
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `i` and `v`, where `i` is an integer in the range \(0 \leq i \leq n-1\) and `v` is an integer. The function updates the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) by adding `v` to the elements at indices from `i + 1` to the next highest index that is a multiple of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. Specifically, it updates the BITTree such that the value `v` is added to the element at index `i + 1`, then to the next index that is a multiple of 2, then to the next index that is a multiple of 4, and so on, until the index exceeds `n`. The function ensures that the BITTree reflects the cumulative effect of adding `v` to the specified range of indices. If `i` is already a power of 2, it updates the BITTree starting from `i + 1` and continues until the next power of 2.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
    return ret
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), where `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the permutation, and `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) storing cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index. The function iterates backward through a range of bits from 21 to 0. During each iteration, it checks if adding \(2^i\) (where `i` is the current bit index) to `ret` and `BITTree[ret + 2^i]` to `sm` still satisfies the condition `sm + BITTree[ret + 2^i] <= x`. If the condition holds, it updates `ret` and `sm` accordingly. After the loop, the function returns `ret`, which is the maximum value such that `ret` ≤ `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret]` ≤ `x`. This ensures that `ret` is the largest possible value meeting the specified conditions.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
