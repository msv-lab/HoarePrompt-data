Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the logic required to restore the permutation based on the given conditions. While the annotated version provides more context about the functions, it still does not show how these functions are used to solve the problem correctly. Specifically, the functions `func_6`, `func_7`, and `func_8` are related to a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), but they are not used to solve the problem as described. 

The corrected version of the program should directly construct the permutation based on the given sums. The provided code seems to be attempting to use a BIT, but it does not show how to use the BIT to find the correct permutation. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is maintained.
