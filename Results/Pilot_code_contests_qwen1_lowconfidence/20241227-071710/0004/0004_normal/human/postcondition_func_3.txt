The function `func_4` accepts a list `arr` of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is within the range `0 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and each element `s_i` in `arr` satisfies `0 <= s_i <= (n*(n-1))/2`, corresponding to a valid permutation of length `n`. After executing, the function prints the elements of `arr` separated by spaces followed by a newline character. There is no return value from the function.
