The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `i` and `v`, where `i` is an integer in the range \(0 \leq i \leq n-1\) and `v` is an integer. The function updates the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) by adding `v` to the elements at indices from `i + 1` to the next highest index that is a multiple of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. Specifically, it updates the BITTree such that the value `v` is added to the element at index `i + 1`, then to the next index that is a multiple of 2, then to the next index that is a multiple of 4, and so on, until the index exceeds `n`. The function ensures that the BITTree reflects the cumulative effect of adding `v` to the specified range of indices. If `i` is already a power of 2, it updates the BITTree starting from `i + 1` and continues until the next power of 2.
