The function `func_1` reads an integer input `n` from the user, followed by `n` additional integers representing an array `s`. It then returns these values as a single integer (the first input `n`) concatenated with the `n` integers from the array `s` as a string. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it relies on user input through `raw_input()` to proceed. The function does not perform any operations on the input values; it simply collects them and returns them in a specific format.
