The function `func_5()` reads input from standard input (stdin), processes it by splitting the input based on spaces, converting each element to an integer, and returning an iterator of these integers. There are no explicit input parameters. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert the elements to integers. The function does not handle these cases, so an error might occur if the input does not consist solely of integers separated by spaces.
