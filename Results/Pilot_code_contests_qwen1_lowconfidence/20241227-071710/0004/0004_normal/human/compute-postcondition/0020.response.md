The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), where `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the permutation, and `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) that stores the cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index.

The function returns `ret`, which is the maximum value such that `ret` ≤ `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret]` ≤ `x`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept an integer `x` and return the maximum value `ret` satisfying `ret` ≤ `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret]` ≤ `x`.
