To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the conditions under which the loop executes.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 21 down to 0.
- For each iteration, `pw` is set to \(2^i\).
- The loop checks if `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`.
- If both conditions are true, `ret` is updated to `ret + pw`, and `sm` is updated to `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]`.

### Final State Determination:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing cumulative sums.
   - `sm` is 0.
   - `ret` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues to update `ret` and `sm` as long as the conditions `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x` are satisfied.
   - Since `pw` starts at \(2^{21}\) and decreases by powers of 2, the loop will add the largest possible values of `pw` to `ret` as long as the conditions hold.

3. **Final Values:**
   - The loop will continue to add the largest possible `pw` values to `ret` until either `ret + pw > n` or `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] > x`.
   - Once the loop exits, `ret` will be the maximum value such that `ret <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret] <= x`.

### Conclusion:
After the loop finishes executing, the final state will be:
- `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing cumulative sums.
- `sm` is the sum of the values added to `sm` during the loop.
- `ret` is the maximum value such that `ret \leq n` and `sm + BITTree[ret] \leq x`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing cumulative sums, `sm` is the sum of the values added to `sm` during the loop, `ret` is the maximum value such that `ret \leq n` and `sm + BITTree[ret] \leq x`.**
