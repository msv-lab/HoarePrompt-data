Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing the cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index.
- `sm` is updated to `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]`.
- `ret` is updated to `ret + pw`.
- `i` is 21.
- `pw` is \(2^{21}\).
- If `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x`, the above updates are applied. Otherwise, the original values of `sm` and `ret` remain unchanged.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(21, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 21.
   - `pw` is \(2^{21}\).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates from 21 to 0 in reverse order.
   - In each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the Start of the Current Iteration**:
   - `i` is 21.
   - `pw` is \(2^{21}\).

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - If the conditions `ret + pw <= n` and `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x` are met, `i` and `pw` would be updated as follows:
     - `i` would be updated to `i - 1`.
     - `pw` would be updated to \(2^{(i-1)}`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since we are considering the start of the next iteration, `i` will be decreased by 1, making it 20.
   - `pw` will be updated to \(2^{20}\).

6. **Updated Conditions**:
   - The updated value of `i` is 20.
   - The updated value of `pw` is \(2^{20}\).

### Final State:
- `i` is 20.
- `pw` is \(2^{20}\).

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration of the loop, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` is 20.
- `pw` is \(2^{20}\).

The other variables (`x`, `n`, `BITTree`, `sm`, and `ret`) remain unchanged unless they were updated inside the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to these variables.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 20, `pw` is \(2^{20}\)**.
