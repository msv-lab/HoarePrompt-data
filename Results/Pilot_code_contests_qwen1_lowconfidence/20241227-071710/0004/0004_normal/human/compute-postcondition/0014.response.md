The code `pw = 1 << i` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` positions, where `i` is 19. This operation is equivalent to multiplying 1 by \(2^{19}\). Given that `pw` was initially \(2^{40}\), after this operation, `pw` will be \(2^{40} \times 2^{19} = 2^{59}\).

Other variables (`i`, `ret`, `sm`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 19, `pw` is \(2^{59}\), `ret` is \(2^{40}\) or unchanged, and `sm` is `sm` plus `BITTree[2^{40}]` or unchanged**
