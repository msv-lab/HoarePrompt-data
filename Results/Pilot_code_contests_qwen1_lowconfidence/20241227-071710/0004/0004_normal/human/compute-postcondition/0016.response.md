`sm` is incremented by `BITTree[ret]`. Given that `ret` is \(2^{40} + 2^{59}\), the value of `sm` becomes `sm` plus `BITTree[2^{40} + 2^{59}]\). The states of the other variables (`i` and `pw`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 19, `pw` is \(2^{59}\), `ret` is \(2^{40} + 2^{59}\), and `sm` is `sm` plus `BITTree[2^{40} + 2^{59}]**
