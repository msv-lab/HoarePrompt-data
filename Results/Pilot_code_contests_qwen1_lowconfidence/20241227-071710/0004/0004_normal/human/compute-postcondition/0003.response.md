The code snippet `pw = 1 << i` shifts the bit `i` places to the left, which is equivalent to multiplying `1` by `2^i`. Given that `i` is initially set to `21`, the value of `pw` will be `2^21`.

So, the variable `pw` is assigned the value `2^21`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n*(n-1))//2, `n` is a positive integer, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing the cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index, `sm` is 0, `ret` is 0, `i` is 21, `pw` is 2^21**
