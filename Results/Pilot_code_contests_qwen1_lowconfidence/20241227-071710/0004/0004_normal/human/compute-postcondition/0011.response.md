`sm` is incremented by the value of `BITTree[ret]`. Given that `ret` is equal to \(2^{40}\), the value added to `sm` is `BITTree[2^{40}]`. However, the value of `BITTree[2^{40}]` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `sm`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 20; `pw` is \(2^{40}\); `ret` is \(2^{40}\); `sm` is `sm` plus `BITTree[2^{40}]`**
