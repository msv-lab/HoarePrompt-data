Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n*(n-1))//2, `n` is a positive integer, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing the cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index, `sm` is 0, `ret` is 0, `i` is 21, `pw` is 2^21, and the current value of `ret` is less than or equal to `n` and the current value of `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`***
