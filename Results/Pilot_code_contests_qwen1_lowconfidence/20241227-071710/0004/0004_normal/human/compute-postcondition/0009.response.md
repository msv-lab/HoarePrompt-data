The code `pw = 1 << i` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` positions. Given that `i` is 20, this operation effectively multiplies `1` by \(2^{20}\).

In the initial state, `i` is 20 and `pw` is \(2^{20}\). After executing the code, `pw` will be updated to \(2^{20} \times 2^{20} = 2^{40}\). The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 20; `pw` is \(2^{40}\)**
