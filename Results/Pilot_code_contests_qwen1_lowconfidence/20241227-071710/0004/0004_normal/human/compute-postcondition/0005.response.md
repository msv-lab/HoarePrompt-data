The code `ret += pw` increments the value of `ret` by the value of `pw`. Given the initial state where `pw` is \(2^{21}\), the value of `ret` will be updated to `ret + 2^{21}`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n*(n-1))//2, `n` is a positive integer, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing the cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index, `sm` is 0, `ret` is `ret + 2^{21}`, `i` is 21, `pw` is 2^21, and the current value of `ret` is less than or equal to `n` and the current value of `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`**.
