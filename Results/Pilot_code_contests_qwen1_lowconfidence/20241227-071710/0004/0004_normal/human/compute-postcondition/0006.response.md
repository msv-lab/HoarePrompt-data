`sm` is incremented by the value of `BITTree[ret]`. The previous value of `sm` is `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]`, and since `BITTree[ret + pw]` is part of the condition and hasn't changed, we can simplify it. The updated value of `sm` is now `sm + BITTree[ret + pw] + BITTree[ret] - BITTree[ret + pw] = sm + BITTree[ret]`.

The other variables (`x`, `n`, `BITTree`, `ret`, `i`, and `pw`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n*(n-1))//2, `n` is a positive integer, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing the cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index, `sm` is `sm + BITTree[ret]`, `ret` is `ret + pw`, `i` is 21, `pw` is 2^21, and the current value of `sm + BITTree[ret + pw]` is less than or equal to `x`**
