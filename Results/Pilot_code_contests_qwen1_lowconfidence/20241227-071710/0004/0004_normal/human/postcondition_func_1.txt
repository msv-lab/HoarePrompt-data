The function `func_2()` reads input from standard input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It returns a map object containing these integers. This function assumes that the input is provided in the correct format: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers. If the input format is incorrect, the function will raise an error because `raw_input().split()` will not correctly parse the input. There are no explicit checks for the constraints on `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) or the values of the integers (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/2). After the function concludes, the program state will be such that the map object contains the integers read from the standard input.
