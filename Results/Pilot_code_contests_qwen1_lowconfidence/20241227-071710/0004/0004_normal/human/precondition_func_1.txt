The function does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}). The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/2), representing the sums described in the problem statement.
