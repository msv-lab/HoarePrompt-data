#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are present since the function does not take any parameters. However, the function reads input from the user using `raw_input()`, which is not part of the function's signature but is crucial for the program's operation. The input consists of the integer n followed by n integers representing the array s.
def func_1():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user followed by n integers representing the array s
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input `n` from the user, followed by `n` additional integers representing an array `s`. It then returns these values as a single integer (the first input `n`) concatenated with the `n` integers from the array `s` as a string. There are no parameters passed to the function, and it relies on user input through `raw_input()` to proceed. The function does not perform any operations on the input values; it simply collects them and returns them in a specific format.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}). The second line contains n integers s_{1}, s_{2}, …, s_{n} (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/2), representing the sums described in the problem statement.
def func_2():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers read from the standard input, where the first line contains the number of integers to follow and the second line contains those integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` reads input from standard input consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It returns a map object containing these integers. This function assumes that the input is provided in the correct format: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers. If the input format is incorrect, the function will raise an error because `raw_input().split()` will not correctly parse the input. There are no explicit checks for the constraints on `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) or the values of the integers (0 ≤ s_{i} ≤ (n(n-1))/2). After the function concludes, the program state will be such that the map object contains the integers read from the standard input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}.
def func_3(n):
    stdout.write(str(n) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It writes the integer `n` to standard output followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the integer `n` has been printed to the console.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and each s_i (where s_i is the i-th element of arr) satisfies 0 <= s_i <= (n*(n-1))/2, corresponding to a valid permutation of length n.
def func_4(arr):
    pr(' '.join(map(str, arr)) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a list `arr` of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is within the range `0 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and each element `s_i` in `arr` satisfies `0 <= s_i <= (n*(n-1))/2`, corresponding to a valid permutation of length `n`. After executing, the function prints the elements of `arr` separated by spaces followed by a newline character. There is no return value from the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_5()` are defined in its signature, thus it does not have any explicit input parameters. The function reads input from `stdin`, processes it, and returns an iterator of integers.
def func_5():
    return map(int, stdin.read().split())
    #The program returns an iterator of integers read from standard input (stdin) and split based on spaces, with each element converted to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5()` reads input from standard input (stdin), processes it by splitting the input based on spaces, converting each element to an integer, and returning an iterator of these integers. There are no explicit input parameters. Potential edge cases include the input being empty or containing non-integer values, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert the elements to integers. The function does not handle these cases, so an error might occur if the input does not consist solely of integers separated by spaces.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 1 <= i <= n, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) initialized with a length of n+1 containing non-negative integer values.
def func_6(i):
    s = 0
    i = i + 1
    while i > 0:
        s += BITTree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `s` is the prefix sum up to the original value of `i` in the Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) `BITTree`, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) initialized with a length of `n+1` containing non-negative integer values.
    return s
    #The program returns s, which is the prefix sum up to the original value of i in the Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) BITTree
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts an integer `i` as a parameter and returns the prefix sum up to the original value of `i` in the Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) `BITTree`. The function starts by incrementing `i` by 1. It then iterates using a while loop where it accumulates the sum of elements in `BITTree` from index `i` to the beginning of the tree, updating `i` by subtracting its largest leftmost set bit until `i` becomes 0. After the loop, the function returns the accumulated sum `s`. This process ensures that the returned value is the prefix sum up to the original value of `i` in the `BITTree`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i <= n, and v is an integer representing the value to be added to the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) at index i after adjusting i by adding 1.
def func_7(i, v):
    i += 1
    while i <= n:
        BITTree[i] += v
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is greater than `n`, `BITTree[i-1]` is the cumulative effect of adding `v` at every position up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, where `i` was updated to the next power of 2 each time the loop executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `i` and `v`, where `i` is an integer in the range \(0 \leq i \leq n-1\) and `v` is an integer. The function updates the Binary Indexed Tree (BITTree) by adding `v` to the elements at indices from `i + 1` to the next highest index that is a multiple of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. Specifically, it updates the BITTree such that the value `v` is added to the element at index `i + 1`, then to the next index that is a multiple of 2, then to the next index that is a multiple of 4, and so on, until the index exceeds `n`. The function ensures that the BITTree reflects the cumulative effect of adding `v` to the specified range of indices. If `i` is already a power of 2, it updates the BITTree starting from `i + 1` and continues until the next power of 2.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 0 <= x <= (n*(n-1))//2, n is a positive integer representing the size of the permutation, and BITTree is a Binary Indexed Tree (also known as a Fenwick Tree) that stores the cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index.
def func_8(x):
    ret = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(21, -1, -1):
        pw = 1 << i
        
        if ret + pw <= n and sm + BITTree[ret + pw] <= x:
            ret += pw
            sm += BITTree[ret]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), `n` is a positive integer, `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree storing cumulative sums, `sm` is the sum of the values added to `sm` during the loop, `ret` is the maximum value such that `ret \leq n` and `sm + BITTree[ret] \leq x`.
    return ret
    #`The program returns ret, which is the maximum value such that ret ≤ n and sm + BITTree[ret] ≤ x`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` such that \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), where `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the permutation, and `BITTree` is a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) storing cumulative sums of some permutation-related values up to a certain index. The function iterates backward through a range of bits from 21 to 0. During each iteration, it checks if adding \(2^i\) (where `i` is the current bit index) to `ret` and `BITTree[ret + 2^i]` to `sm` still satisfies the condition `sm + BITTree[ret + 2^i] <= x`. If the condition holds, it updates `ret` and `sm` accordingly. After the loop, the function returns `ret`, which is the maximum value such that `ret` ≤ `n` and `sm + BITTree[ret]` ≤ `x`. This ensures that `ret` is the largest possible value meeting the specified conditions.
