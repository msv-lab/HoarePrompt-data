The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start` (an integer), `step` (an integer), and `count` (a non-negative integer). It returns a `range` object representing a sequence of numbers starting from `start` and ending at `start + count * step - step` (since the end value is exclusive in Python's `range`). The step size for the sequence is determined by the `step` parameter, which is always specified as `1` in the `range` function. If `step` is not equal to `1`, the returned range will still have a step of `1`, despite the annotation stating otherwise. The function does not modify any external state and only relies on its input parameters to generate the sequence. Potential edge cases include when `count` is `0`, in which case the range will be empty. If `step` is `0`, the behavior is undefined because `range` with a step of `0` is not valid.
