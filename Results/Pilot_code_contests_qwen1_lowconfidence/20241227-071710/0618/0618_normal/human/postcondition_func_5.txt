The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` of non-negative integers and two optional parameters `start` and `end`. It returns a range object that starts from the value of `start` (default 0) and ends at the length of the list `l` plus `end` (default 0). The function does not modify the list `l` or perform any operations on its elements. If `start` is negative, the range will still begin from `start`, potentially including fewer elements than the length of the list. Similarly, if `end` is negative, the ending value of the range will be `len(l) + end`, which could be less than the length of the list.
