The function `func_7` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10. It calculates 2 raised to the power of `(n-1)`'s bit length and returns this value. This means that for any valid `n`, the function will compute the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `2^(n-1)`. For example, if `n` is 3, `(n-1)` is 2, and the bit length of 2 is 2, so the function returns \(2^2 = 4\). The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, returning \(2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1\). If `n` were outside the range [1, 10], the function would raise a `ValueError` due to the range check inherent in the condition `1 <= n <= 10`. However, since the return postcondition specifies that `n` must be within this range, the function ensures that only valid inputs produce meaningful outputs.
