The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). It achieves this by implementing the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. This process works for any pair of non-negative integers, including when one or both of them are zero. If either `x` or `y` is zero, the GCD is the non-zero value, as the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself.
