The print statement 'NO' does not affect the values of the variables. The conditions `s1` is not equal to `s2`, `s1 + 1 != s2`, and `(s1 != s2 + 1)` are still true, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, and `s1` is not equal to `s2`, `s1 + 1 != s2`, and `(s1 != s2 + 1)`**
