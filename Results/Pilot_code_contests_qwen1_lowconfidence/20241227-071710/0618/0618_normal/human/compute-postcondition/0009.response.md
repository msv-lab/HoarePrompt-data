Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). It achieves this by implementing the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. This process works for any pair of non-negative integers, including when one or both of them are zero. If either `x` or `y` is zero, the GCD is the non-zero value, as the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself.**

**Edge cases:**
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is 0, the function will return 0, which is the correct GCD.
- If either `x` or `y` is 0, the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD.

**Missing functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that `x` is the GCD of `x_0` and `y_0` after the loop, but it does not explicitly mention the case where both `x` and `y` are 0. However, the actual code handles this case correctly by returning 0.
