`x` is assigned the value of `y`, and `y` is assigned the value of `x % y`. Given the initial state where `x` is `y_0 % x_0` and `y` is `x_0`, the updated values are:

- Initially, `x = y_0 % x_0`
- Initially, `y = x_0`

After executing the code:
- `x` becomes `y`, which is `x_0`.
- `y` becomes `x % y`, which is `x_0 % (y_0 % x_0)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is `x_0`, `y` is `x_0 % (y_0 % x_0)`, `x_0` must be non-zero.**
