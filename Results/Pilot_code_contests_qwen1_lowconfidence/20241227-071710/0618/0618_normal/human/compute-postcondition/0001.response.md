The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. `x` is an integer representing the number of a, 0's, 1's, 2's, or 3's Trans has, and `r` is an integer representing the target value (0, 1, 2, or 3) to which `x` needs to be rounded up to the nearest multiple. The function returns `(x + r - 1) // r`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept two integers `x` and `r`, and return `(x + r - 1) // r`.
