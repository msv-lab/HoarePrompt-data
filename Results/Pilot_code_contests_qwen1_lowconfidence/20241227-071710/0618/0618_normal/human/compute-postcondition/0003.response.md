The initial state is given as follows:
- `x` is `y_0 % x_0`
- `y` is `x_0` and `y` (or equivalently `x_0`) must be non-zero

The code snippet is:
```python
x, y = y, x % y
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. The value of `y` is updated to the current value of `x`.
2. The new value of `x` is calculated as `x % y`.

Given the initial state:
- Let `x_0` be the initial value of `x`, which is `y_0 % x_0`.
- `y` is `x_0`.

The updated value of `x` will be `x_0 % y_0 % x_0`. However, since `y_0 % x_0` is the initial value of `x`, we substitute `x` with `y_0 % x_0` in the calculation:
- New `x` = `(y_0 % x_0) % y_0`.

Since `y_0 % x_0` is the remainder when `y_0` is divided by `x_0`, it means that `(y_0 % x_0) % y_0` simplifies to `y_0 % x_0` because the modulo operation with the same number doesn't change its value.

Therefore, the new values are:
- `x` is now `y_0 % x_0` (which is the same as the original `x`).
- `y` is now `x_0`.

The output state remains:
- `x` is `y_0 % x_0`
- `y` is `x_0`

Output State: **`x` is `y_0 % x_0`, `y` is `x_0`**
