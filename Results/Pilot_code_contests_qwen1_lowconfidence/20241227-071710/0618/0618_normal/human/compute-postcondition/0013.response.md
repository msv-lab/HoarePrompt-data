Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, and `out` is either a list constructed from the values of `a`, `b`, and `d` when `a > 0`, or `[2] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d` when `a <= 0`.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts, while retaining the conditions stated in the precondition.
