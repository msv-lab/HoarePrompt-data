Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given Information:
- The `while` loop condition is `while y:`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `x` is `y_0 % x_0`
  - `y` is `x_0`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `y` is non-zero (`y != 0`).

2. **Current State**: 
   - `x = y_0 % x_0`
   - `y = x_0`

3. **Next Iteration**: 
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be non-zero. 

Given that `y` is currently set to `x_0`, for the loop to continue, `x_0` must be non-zero. If `x_0` were zero, the loop would terminate immediately because `y` would become zero in the next step due to the modulo operation.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `x_0` (which is the initial value of `y`) is non-zero.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `x_0` is non-zero.

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` is `y_0 % x_0`, `y` is `x_0` and `x_0` must be non-zero**
