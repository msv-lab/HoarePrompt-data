`b` is decremented by 1, which means `b -= 1`. Since `b` was originally a non-negative integer, decrementing it by 1 results in `b` being a non-negative integer minus 1. The other variables (`a`, `c`, `d`, `s1`, `s2`) remain unchanged. The condition `s1 + 1` equals `s2` remains valid.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer minus 1, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, and `s1 + 1` equals `s2`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer minus 1, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, and `s1 + 1` equals `s2`**
