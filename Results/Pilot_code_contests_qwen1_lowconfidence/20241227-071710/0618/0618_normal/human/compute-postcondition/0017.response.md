The code `d -= 1` decreases the value of `d` by 1. Since `d` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, subtracting 1 from it means `d` is now one less than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is one less than its original value, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, and `s1` is not equal to `s2`, and `s1 + 1` equals `s2`, and `s1` is greater than `s2`**
