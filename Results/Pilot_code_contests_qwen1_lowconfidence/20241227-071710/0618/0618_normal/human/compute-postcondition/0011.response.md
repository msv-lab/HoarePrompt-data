`c` is decremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `c` was a non-negative integer, and `s1` is equal to `b - a`, which is not equal to `s2`, which is equal to `c - d`. Also, the current value of `s1` is not greater than 0. After decrementing `c`, the new value of `s1` will be `b - a`, `s2` remains unchanged as it is dependent on the values of `c` and `d`, and `c` is now `c - 1`.

Since `s1` was not greater than 0 and `c` was a non-negative integer, decrementing `c` does not change the fact that `s1` is not greater than 0. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer - 1, `d` is a non-negative integer, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, and `s1` is not greater than 0**
