Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `d` is a non-negative integer. If `d > 0`, then `d` is decremented by 1, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, and `s1 + 1` equals `s2`, and `s1` is greater than `s2`; `out` is a list constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]`. If `d` is not greater than 0, then `b` is decremented by 1, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, `s1 + 1` equals `s2`, and `out` is a list equal to `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [1]`.***
