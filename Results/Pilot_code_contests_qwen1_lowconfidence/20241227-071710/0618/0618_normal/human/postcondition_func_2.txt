The function `func_3()` accepts user input for four non-negative integers (a, b, c, d) separated by spaces and returns them as a list [a, b, c, d]. The function ensures that the input is correctly split into four integers. If the user inputs fewer than four integers, more than four integers, or non-integer values, the function will raise a ValueError due to the use of `map(int, input().split())`. The function does not handle any other edge cases beyond ensuring exactly four integer inputs.
