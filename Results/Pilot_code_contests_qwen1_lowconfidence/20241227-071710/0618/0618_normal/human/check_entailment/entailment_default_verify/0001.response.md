Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the case where the counts of the numbers do not allow for a valid beautiful sequence. As demonstrated in the example input `1 2 3 4`, the program incorrectly attempts to generate a sequence when it should recognize that such a sequence is impossible and print "NO".

The output hints and the provided examples further support this conclusion. For instance, the hint for function `func_8` indicates that it handles edge cases like rounding up to the nearest multiple correctly. However, this functionality is not utilized in `func_1` to properly validate the possibility of constructing a beautiful sequence. Instead, the logic in `func_1` tries to generate a sequence without checking if the conditions for its existence are met, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.
