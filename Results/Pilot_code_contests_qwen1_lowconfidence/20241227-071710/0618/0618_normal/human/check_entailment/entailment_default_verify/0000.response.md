Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when `a` and `c` are both non-zero and `b` and `d` are zero. According to the problem description, if it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence, the program should output "NO". However, the current implementation attempts to construct a sequence even in such invalid cases, leading to incorrect outputs. For example, the input `2 0 2 0` should result in "NO", but the program currently attempts to construct a sequence like `[0, 2, 0, 2]`, which is invalid. Adding a check to return "NO" in this specific case would resolve the issue.
