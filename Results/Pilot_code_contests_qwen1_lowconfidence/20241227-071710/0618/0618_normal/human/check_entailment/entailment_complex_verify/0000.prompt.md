You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid sequence when `a` and `c` are both greater than zero and `b` and `d` are both zero. This situation requires careful handling to ensure the sequence alternates correctly.

Consider the following input:
```
2 0 2 0
```
Expected output:
```
NO
```
However, the current implementation might attempt to create a sequence like `[0, 2, 0, 2]`, which is invalid since the difference between consecutive numbers should always be 1.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `a` and `c` are both non-zero and `b` and `d` are zero by returning "NO". This can be added as an additional condition check before attempting to construct the sequence.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` takes no parameters and returns `None`. It processes four non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) such that their sum is less than or equal to \(10^5\). The function calculates the differences \(s1 = b - a\) and \(s2 = c - d\). Based on these differences, it constructs a list `out` and performs specific operations:

1. If \(s1\) equals \(s2\), it constructs the list `out` as \([1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d\).
2. If \(s1 + 1\) equals \(s2\) and \(a > 0\), it decreases \(a\) by 1 and constructs the list `out` as \([0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d\).
3. If \(s1 + 1\) equals \(s2\) and \(a \leq 0\), it decreases \(c\) by 1 and constructs the list `out` as \([2] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d\).
4. If \(s1\) equals \(s2 + 1\) and \(d > 0\), it decreases \(d\) by 1 and constructs the list `out` as \([1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]\).
5. If \(s1\) equals \(s2 + 1\) and \(d \leq 0\), it decreases \(b\) by 1 and constructs the list `out` as \([1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [1]\).

After performing these operations, it prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the list `out`. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x_0` and `y_0`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x that is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x_0 and y_0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). It achieves this by implementing the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. This process works for any pair of non-negative integers, including when one or both of them are zero. If either `x` or `y` is zero, the GCD is the non-zero value, as the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 < a + b + c + d ≤ 10^5.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers [a, b, c, d] after the user inputs four non-negative integers separated by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` accepts user input for four non-negative integers (a, b, c, d) separated by spaces and returns them as a list [a, b, c, d]. The function ensures that the input is correctly split into four integers. If the user inputs fewer than four integers, more than four integers, or non-integer values, the function will raise a ValueError due to the use of `map(int, input().split())`. The function does not handle any other edge cases beyond ensuring exactly four integer inputs.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a callable function and dim is a variable-length tuple of positive integers representing dimensions for nested list comprehension. Each element in dim represents the number of times the innermost callable function should be called and nested.
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #[func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a callable function `f` and a variable-length tuple `dim` of positive integers. If `dim` is not empty, it returns a nested list comprehension where each level of nesting corresponds to an element in `dim`, and each nested level calls `func_4` recursively with the remaining elements of `dim` until `dim` is exhausted. If `dim` is empty, it simply returns the result of calling `f()` directly. An edge case is when `dim` contains only one element; in this case, the function will still behave as described, returning a list containing the result of calling `func_4` with the remaining elements (which will be an empty tuple), effectively just calling `f()` once. There is no missing functionality as per the provided code; however, it does not handle negative or non-integer values in `dim`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such values are passed.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting value of the sequence, step is an integer representing the fixed difference between consecutive numbers in the sequence which is always 1, and count is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in the sequence.
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #range(start, start + count, 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start` (an integer), `step` (an integer), and `count` (a non-negative integer). It returns a `range` object representing a sequence of numbers starting from `start` and ending at `start + count * step - step` (since the end value is exclusive in Python's `range`). The step size for the sequence is determined by the `step` parameter, which is always specified as `1` in the `range` function. If `step` is not equal to `1`, the returned range will still have a step of `1`, despite the annotation stating otherwise. The function does not modify any external state and only relies on its input parameters to generate the sequence. Potential edge cases include when `count` is `0`, in which case the range will be empty. If `step` is `0`, the behavior is undefined because `range` with a step of `0` is not valid.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers containing non-negative integers a, b, c, and d (a, b, c, d) such that 0 < a + b + c + d ≤ 10^5. start and end are integers where start defaults to 0 and end defaults to 0.
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #`The program returns a range object starting from start (default 0) up to len(l) + end (default 0)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` of non-negative integers and two optional parameters `start` and `end`. It returns a range object that starts from the value of `start` (default 0) and ends at the length of the list `l` plus `end` (default 0). The function does not modify the list `l` or perform any operations on its elements. If `start` is negative, the range will still begin from `start`, potentially including fewer elements than the length of the list. Similarly, if `end` is negative, the ending value of the range will be `len(l) + end`, which could be less than the length of the list.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 10
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n-1) bit length, where n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10. It calculates 2 raised to the power of `(n-1)`'s bit length and returns this value. This means that for any valid `n`, the function will compute the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `2^(n-1)`. For example, if `n` is 3, `(n-1)` is 2, and the bit length of 2 is 2, so the function returns \(2^2 = 4\). The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, returning \(2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1\). If `n` were outside the range [1, 10], the function would raise a `ValueError` due to the range check inherent in the condition `1 <= n <= 10`. However, since the return postcondition specifies that `n` must be within this range, the function ensures that only valid inputs produce meaningful outputs.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the number of a, 0's, 1's, 2's, or 3's Trans has, and r is an integer representing the target value (0, 1, 2, or 3) to which x needs to be rounded up to the nearest multiple.
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #`(x + r - 1) // r` where x is an integer representing the number of a, 0's, 1's, 2's, or 3's Trans has, and r is an integer representing the target value (0, 1, 2, or 3) to which x needs to be rounded up to the nearest multiple
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. `x` is an integer representing the number of a, 0's, 1's, 2's, or 3's Trans has, and `r` is an integer representing the target value (0, 1, 2, or 3) to which `x` needs to be rounded up to the nearest multiple. The function returns the result of `(x + r - 1) // r`. This operation effectively rounds `x` up to the nearest multiple of `r`. 

Edge cases to consider:
- If `x` is already a multiple of `r`, the function returns `x` itself.
- If `x` is less than `r`, the function returns `1` because the smallest multiple of `r` greater than `x` is `r`.
- If `r` is `0`, the expression `(x + r - 1) // r` would result in a division by zero, which is undefined. Therefore, the function should handle this case appropriately, either by raising an exception or returning a specific value indicating an error.

There are no missing functionalities mentioned in the given code, and the provided annotations correctly describe the intended behavior of the function.
