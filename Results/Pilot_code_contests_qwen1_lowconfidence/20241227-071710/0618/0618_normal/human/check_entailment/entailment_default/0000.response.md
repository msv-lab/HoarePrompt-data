Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to construct a beautiful sequence using the given counts of 0s, 1s, 2s, and 3s. However, the code has a flaw in its logic that does not guarantee the construction of a beautiful sequence in all cases. Specifically, the code does not properly handle the scenario where the sequence cannot be constructed due to the differences in counts of adjacent numbers being too large.

For instance, consider the following cases:

1. **Case 1**: Input: `2 2 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `YES 0 1 0 1 2 3 2`
   - This case is handled correctly by the code.

2. **Case 2**: Input: `1 2 3 4`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - This case is also handled correctly by the code.

3. **Case 3**: Input: `2 2 2 3`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - This case is also handled correctly by the code.

However, the code does not handle the scenario where the counts of numbers do not allow for a valid sequence. Consider the following case:

4. **Case 4**: Input: `3 2 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - This case is not handled correctly by the code. The code tries to construct the sequence but does not check if the sequence can be formed. In this case, the sequence cannot be constructed because the counts do not allow for a valid transition between numbers.

The code constructs the sequence based on the differences between counts but does not validate whether the constructed sequence is truly beautiful. A valid check would involve ensuring that the sequence can be formed with the given counts and that the differences between consecutive numbers are exactly 1. The current implementation does not perform this validation, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making the overall correctness **False**.
