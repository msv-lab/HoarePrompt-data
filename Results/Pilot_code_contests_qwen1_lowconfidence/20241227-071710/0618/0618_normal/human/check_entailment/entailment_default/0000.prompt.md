You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1()` takes no parameters and returns `None`. It processes four non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) such that their sum is less than or equal to \(10^5\). The function calculates the differences \(s1 = b - a\) and \(s2 = c - d\). Based on these differences, it constructs a list `out` and performs specific operations:

1. If \(s1\) equals \(s2\), it constructs the list `out` as \([1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d\).
2. If \(s1 + 1\) equals \(s2\) and \(a > 0\), it decreases \(a\) by 1 and constructs the list `out` as \([0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d\).
3. If \(s1 + 1\) equals \(s2\) and \(a \leq 0\), it decreases \(c\) by 1 and constructs the list `out` as \([2] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d\).
4. If \(s1\) equals \(s2 + 1\) and \(d > 0\), it decreases \(d\) by 1 and constructs the list `out` as \([1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]\).
5. If \(s1\) equals \(s2 + 1\) and \(d \leq 0\), it decreases \(b\) by 1 and constructs the list `out` as \([1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [1]\).

After performing these operations, it prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the list `out`. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). It achieves this by implementing the Euclidean algorithm, which repeatedly replaces `x` with `y` and `y` with `x % y` until `y` becomes zero. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. This process works for any pair of non-negative integers, including when one or both of them are zero. If either `x` or `y` is zero, the GCD is the non-zero value, as the GCD of any number and zero is the number itself.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` accepts user input for four non-negative integers (a, b, c, d) separated by spaces and returns them as a list [a, b, c, d]. The function ensures that the input is correctly split into four integers. If the user inputs fewer than four integers, more than four integers, or non-integer values, the function will raise a ValueError due to the use of `map(int, input().split())`. The function does not handle any other edge cases beyond ensuring exactly four integer inputs.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(f, *dim):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a callable function `f` and a variable-length tuple `dim` of positive integers. If `dim` is not empty, it returns a nested list comprehension where each level of nesting corresponds to an element in `dim`, and each nested level calls `func_4` recursively with the remaining elements of `dim` until `dim` is exhausted. If `dim` is empty, it simply returns the result of calling `f()` directly. An edge case is when `dim` contains only one element; in this case, the function will still behave as described, returning a list containing the result of calling `func_4` with the remaining elements (which will be an empty tuple), effectively just calling `f()` once. There is no missing functionality as per the provided code; however, it does not handle negative or non-integer values in `dim`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such values are passed.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start` (an integer), `step` (an integer), and `count` (a non-negative integer). It returns a `range` object representing a sequence of numbers starting from `start` and ending at `start + count * step - step` (since the end value is exclusive in Python's `range`). The step size for the sequence is determined by the `step` parameter, which is always specified as `1` in the `range` function. If `step` is not equal to `1`, the returned range will still have a step of `1`, despite the annotation stating otherwise. The function does not modify any external state and only relies on its input parameters to generate the sequence. Potential edge cases include when `count` is `0`, in which case the range will be empty. If `step` is `0`, the behavior is undefined because `range` with a step of `0` is not valid.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(l, start=0, end=0):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a list `l` of non-negative integers and two optional parameters `start` and `end`. It returns a range object that starts from the value of `start` (default 0) and ends at the length of the list `l` plus `end` (default 0). The function does not modify the list `l` or perform any operations on its elements. If `start` is negative, the range will still begin from `start`, potentially including fewer elements than the length of the list. Similarly, if `end` is negative, the ending value of the range will be `len(l) + end`, which could be less than the length of the list.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a non-negative integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10. It calculates 2 raised to the power of `(n-1)`'s bit length and returns this value. This means that for any valid `n`, the function will compute the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `2^(n-1)`. For example, if `n` is 3, `(n-1)` is 2, and the bit length of 2 is 2, so the function returns \(2^2 = 4\). The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, returning \(2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1\). If `n` were outside the range [1, 10], the function would raise a `ValueError` due to the range check inherent in the condition `1 <= n <= 10`. However, since the return postcondition specifies that `n` must be within this range, the function ensures that only valid inputs produce meaningful outputs.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two parameters: `x` and `r`. `x` is an integer representing the number of a, 0's, 1's, 2's, or 3's Trans has, and `r` is an integer representing the target value (0, 1, 2, or 3) to which `x` needs to be rounded up to the nearest multiple. The function returns the result of `(x + r - 1) // r`. This operation effectively rounds `x` up to the nearest multiple of `r`. 

Edge cases to consider:
- If `x` is already a multiple of `r`, the function returns `x` itself.
- If `x` is less than `r`, the function returns `1` because the smallest multiple of `r` greater than `x` is `r`.
- If `r` is `0`, the expression `(x + r - 1) // r` would result in a division by zero, which is undefined. Therefore, the function should handle this case appropriately, either by raising an exception or returning a specific value indicating an error.

There are no missing functionalities mentioned in the given code, and the provided annotations correctly describe the intended behavior of the function.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
