Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid sequence when `a` and `c` are both greater than zero and `b` and `d` are both zero. This situation requires careful handling to ensure the sequence alternates correctly.

Consider the following input:
```
2 0 2 0
```
Expected output:
```
NO
```
However, the current implementation might attempt to create a sequence like `[0, 2, 0, 2]`, which is invalid since the difference between consecutive numbers should always be 1.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `a` and `c` are both non-zero and `b` and `d` are zero by returning "NO". This can be added as an additional condition check before attempting to construct the sequence.
