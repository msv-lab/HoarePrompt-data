You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid sequence when `a` and `c` are both greater than zero and `b` and `d` are both zero. This situation requires careful handling to ensure the sequence alternates correctly.

Consider the following input:
```
2 0 2 0
```
Expected output:
```
NO
```
However, the current implementation might attempt to create a sequence like `[0, 2, 0, 2]`, which is invalid since the difference between consecutive numbers should always be 1.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `a` and `c` are both non-zero and `b` and `d` are zero by returning "NO". This can be added as an additional condition check before attempting to construct the sequence.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
