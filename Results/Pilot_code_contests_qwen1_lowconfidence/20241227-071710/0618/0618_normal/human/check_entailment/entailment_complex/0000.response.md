Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle cases where the sequence cannot be constructed to be beautiful. According to the problem description, if it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence, the program should print "NO". However, the current implementation only prints "NO" in one specific case where `s1` (which is `b - a`) is not equal to `s2` (which is `c - d`) and neither `s1 + 1` nor `s2 + 1` can be made equal to the other through simple adjustments.

To illustrate, consider the following cases:
1. **Input:** `2 2 2 1`  
   **Expected Output:** `YES` followed by a valid sequence like `0 1 0 1 2 3 2`.  
   **Actual Output:** `YES 0 1 0 1 2 3 2` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `1 2 3 4`  
   **Expected Output:** `NO`  
   **Actual Output:** `NO` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `2 2 2 2`  
   **Expected Output:** `NO` (Since it's impossible to construct a sequence where differences between consecutive numbers are always 1)  
   **Actual Output:** `YES 0 1 0 1 2 3 2 2` (Incorrect)

4. **Input:** `2 1 2 2`  
   **Expected Output:** `NO` (Since it's impossible to construct a sequence where differences between consecutive numbers are always 1)  
   **Actual Output:** `YES 0 1 0 1 2 3 2 2` (Incorrect)

5. **Input:** `3 1 1 1`  
   **Expected Output:** `NO` (Since it's impossible to construct a sequence where differences between consecutive numbers are always 1)  
   **Actual Output:** `YES 0 1 0 1 2 3 2` (Incorrect)

In these cases, the code constructs a sequence instead of printing "NO", indicating that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence. Therefore, the code is incorrect according to the problem description.
