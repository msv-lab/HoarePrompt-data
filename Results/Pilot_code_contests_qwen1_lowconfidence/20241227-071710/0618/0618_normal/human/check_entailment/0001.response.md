Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the case where the counts of the numbers do not allow for a valid beautiful sequence. 

For example, consider the input `1 2 3 4`. According to the problem description, it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence with these counts. However, the current implementation does not detect this case and prints "YES" along with a sequence, which is incorrect.

To illustrate, let's walk through the logic for the input `1 2 3 4`:

- The function `func_3` reads the input as `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are set to 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
- The function checks the differences `s1` and `s2`:
  - `s1 = b - a = 2 - 1 = 1`
  - `s2 = c - d = 3 - 4 = -1`

Since `s1 != s2` and `s1 + 1 != s2` and `s1 != s2 + 1`, none of the conditions are met, and the function incorrectly prints "NO". However, it should still print "NO" instead of trying to generate a sequence.

Similarly, for inputs like `2 2 2 1`, the program should correctly generate a sequence as shown in the example output. But for inputs like `1 2 3 4`, the program fails to recognize the impossibility and generates an invalid sequence.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
