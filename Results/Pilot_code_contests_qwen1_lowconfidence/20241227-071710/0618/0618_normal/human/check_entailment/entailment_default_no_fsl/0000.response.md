Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1()` does not correctly handle cases where the initial values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) cannot form a beautiful sequence. Here are the key issues:

1. **Initial Checks**: The function does not perform a comprehensive check to ensure that the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) can form a beautiful sequence. For example, it does not check if the total number of transitions required (i.e., the sum of \(|b-a|\), \(|c-d|\), etc.) is feasible given the constraints.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The function does not handle cases where the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are such that forming a beautiful sequence is impossible. For instance, if \(b - a\) and \(c - d\) are not compatible in terms of their absolute values, the sequence cannot be constructed.

3. **Example Where It Fails**: Consider the input \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 3\), and \(d = 4\). According to the problem description, it should output "NO" because it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence with these values. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case and may produce an invalid sequence.

To illustrate, let's run through a test case where the function fails:

- **Test Case**: \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 3\), \(d = 4\)
- **Expected Output**: "NO"
- **Actual Output**: The function tries to construct a sequence, which is not possible, but does not explicitly handle this case.

Thus, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases and hence the correctness is **False**.
