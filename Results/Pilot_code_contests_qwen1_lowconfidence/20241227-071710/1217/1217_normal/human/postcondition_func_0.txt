The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with parameters `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (`a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the original value of `a`. This function essentially computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns the GCD of the two input integers `a` and `b`.
