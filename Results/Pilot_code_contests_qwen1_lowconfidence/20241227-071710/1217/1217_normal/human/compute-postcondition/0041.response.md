The function `func_2(neigh, n)` is called for each `neigh` in `graph[n]`. This means that `func_2` is executed with `neigh` as its first argument and `n` as its second argument for every neighbor of node `n`. However, the exact implementation of `func_2` is not specified, so we cannot determine the specific changes it might make. The only thing we know for certain is that `func_2` is called for each neighbor of `n`.

The initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that `func_2` has been called for each neighbor of `n`.

Output State: **`graph[n]` must have at least one element, and `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called for the next `neigh` in the list.**
