Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the integer number written on vertex `i`, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `visited` is a boolean list used for tracking visited nodes. Each element of `gcdinfo` is an object with attributes `gcd`, `tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, and `ifr2`. The node `n` is not visited.**
