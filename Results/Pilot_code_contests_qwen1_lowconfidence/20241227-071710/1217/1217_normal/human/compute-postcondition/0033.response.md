Postcondition: ***`newgcd` is the GCD of `a[n]` and either `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` or `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` depending on their respective conditions. If `newgcd1 > newgcd2`, then `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is equal to `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1`, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is equal to `gcdinfo[parent].tor1`, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is kept as `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2`. Otherwise, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is equal to `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2`, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is equal to `gcdinfo[parent].tor2`, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is kept as `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1`. In both cases, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is equal to `newgcd`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the integer number written on vertex `i`, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list used for tracking visited nodes, with `visited[n]` being `True`.***
