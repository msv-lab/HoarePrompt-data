To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given state and the loop statement:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
   - `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call.
   - `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the integer number written on vertex `i`.
   - `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree.
   - `visited` is a boolean list used for tracking visited nodes, and `visited[n]` is `True`.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```
   for neigh in graph[n]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each neighbor (`neigh`) of the current node `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, the adjacency list `graph[n]` must contain at least one element (i.e., the node `n` must have at least one neighbor).

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The state before the loop should ensure that `graph[n]` is non-empty, meaning node `n` must have at least one neighbor.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `graph[n]` must have at least one element (i.e., node `n` must have at least one neighbor).

The final state to be adjusted is:
**`graph[n]` must have at least one element**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`graph[n]` must have at least one element**
