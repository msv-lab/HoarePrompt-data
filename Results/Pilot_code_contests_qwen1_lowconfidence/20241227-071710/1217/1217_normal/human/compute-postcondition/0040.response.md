According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `neigh`. The loop iterates over each element in `graph[n]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `graph[n]` must have at least one element, and `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called for the next `neigh` in the list.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `graph[n]` must have at least one element.
   - `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called for the next `neigh` in the list.

2. **Identify the Next Element to Process**:
   - Since `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called for the next `neigh` in the list, this means that the current `neigh` has already been processed.
   - The next iteration of the loop will process the next `neigh` in the list.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - `graph[n]` must still have at least one element (since there is another `neigh` to process).
   - `func_2(neigh, n)` will be called for the next `neigh` in the list.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that we are processing the next `neigh` in the list.

**State: **`graph[n]` must have at least one element, and `func_2(neigh, n)` will be called for the next `neigh` in the list.**
