Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes a tree structure where each node has an associated integer value stored in the list `a`. It uses recursion to traverse the tree and update a data structure `gcdinfo` for each node. The `gcdinfo` for each node stores the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values of its subtree and additional information (`tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, `ifr2`) to track potential changes that can maximize the GCD. The function updates `gcdinfo` based on the GCD calculations involving the current node's value and the GCD of its parent node, as well as additional GCD calculations involving other relevant values.

After the function executes, for each node `n` in the tree:
- `visited[n]` is set to `True`, indicating that the node has been visited.
- The GCD of the subtree rooted at node `n` is stored in `gcdinfo[n].gcd`.
- Additional information (`tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, `ifr2`) in `gcdinfo[n]` is updated to reflect the potential changes that can maximize the GCD of the subtree.

If the parent of the current node is not the root (-1), the GCD of the current node's value and the GCD of its parent node is calculated. This GCD and related information are used to update `gcdinfo[n]`.

The function also ensures that the GCD and related information are propagated through the tree using recursion, starting from the root node.

Edge cases:
- If the parent of the current node is the root (i.e., `parent == -1`), no changes are made to `gcdinfo[n]`.
- If the current node has no neighbors (i.e., `graph[n]` is an empty list), the function simply returns without making any further recursive calls.

Missing functionality:
- The code assumes that `func_1` is defined elsewhere and correctly calculates the GCD. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, and its correctness is assumed.**

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `gcdinfo` contains updated information for each node in the tree, reflecting the GCD of the subtree rooted at that node and additional tracking information.**
