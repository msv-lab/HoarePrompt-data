`gcdinfo[n].tor1` is assigned the value of `gcdinfo[parent].tor2`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `newgcd` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a[n]` and either `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` or `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` depending on their respective conditions. Specifically, if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is `True`, `newgcd` is the result of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])`. If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is `True`, `newgcd` is the result of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr2, a[n])`. Otherwise, `newgcd` is 1. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the integer number written on vertex `i`, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list used for tracking visited nodes, with `visited[n]` being `True`, and `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is equal to `newgcd`. `newgcd1` is less than or equal to `newgcd2`. Currently, `newgcd2` is greater than `newgcd1`; `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is equal to `gcdinfo[parent].tor2`.
