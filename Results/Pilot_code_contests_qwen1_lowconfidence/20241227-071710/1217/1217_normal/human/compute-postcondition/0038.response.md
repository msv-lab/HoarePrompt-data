Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `graph[n]` must have at least one element.
   - `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for neigh in graph[n]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `neigh` in `graph[n]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `graph[n]` must still have at least one element (as it did at the end of the previous iteration).

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `graph[n]` must have at least one element, and assuming that calling `func_2(neigh, n)` does not remove elements from `graph[n]`, `graph[n]` still has at least one element.
   - However, we need to ensure that the loop can continue for the next `neigh`.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `graph[n]` must have at least one element.
   - The next value of `neigh` will be the next element in `graph[n]`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`graph[n]` must have at least one element, and `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called for the next `neigh` in the list.**
