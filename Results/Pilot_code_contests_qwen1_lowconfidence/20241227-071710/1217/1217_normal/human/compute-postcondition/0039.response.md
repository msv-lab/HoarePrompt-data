The code `func_2(neigh, n)` is called, which affects the value of `func_2` with the parameters `neigh` and `n`. However, the exact return value of `func_2(neigh, n)` is not specified, so we cannot determine the new value of `func_2`. The precondition that `graph[n]` must have at least one element remains unchanged. Additionally, the call to `func_2` does not change the values of `graph[n]` directly but may affect its state through the function's implementation.

Output State: **`graph[n]` must have at least one element, and `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called for the next `neigh` in the list. `func_2` has been called with parameters `neigh` and `n`.**
