The function `func_2(neigh, n)` is called with `neigh` being `graph[n]` and `n` being a specific node in the graph. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. 

Given the initial state that `graph[n]` must have at least one element, and assuming that `func_2` does not modify `n` or `graph[n]` (since no modifications are specified), the only affected variable is potentially modified within `func_2`.

Since the function's implementation is not provided, we can only state that the call to `func_2` might perform operations on the elements within `graph[n]` but the specific values of `n` and `graph[n]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[n]` must have at least one element and `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called**
