The code assigns the value of `gcdinfo[parent].gcd` to `gcdinfo[n].ifr1`. The initial state tells us that `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is equal to `newgcd`, which is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`. Therefore, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`.

Output State: **`newgcd` is the result of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])` and is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call; `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the integer number written on vertex `i`; `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `visited` is a boolean list used for tracking visited nodes; `visited[n]` is `True`; `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is equal to `newgcd`; `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is equal to `a[n]`; `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is equal to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`.**
