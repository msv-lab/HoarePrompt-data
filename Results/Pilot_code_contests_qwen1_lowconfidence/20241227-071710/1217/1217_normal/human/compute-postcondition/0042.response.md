Output State: **`graph[n]` must be an empty list, and for every `neigh` in `graph[n]`, `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called at least once.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each neighbor (`neigh`) of the current node (`n`).
- For each neighbor, the function `func_2(neigh, n)` is called.
- This process continues until there are no more neighbors left to iterate over, meaning `graph[n]` becomes an empty list.
- Since the loop ensures that each neighbor is processed exactly once, the condition `graph[n]` must be an empty list indicates that all neighbors have been processed.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `graph[n]` will be an empty list, and `func_2(neigh, n)` will have been called for every `neigh` in the initial `graph[n]`.
