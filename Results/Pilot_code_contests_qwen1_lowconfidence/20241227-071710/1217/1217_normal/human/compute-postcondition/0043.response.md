The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `parent`, which is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call. There are additional parameters `a`, `graph`, and `visited` that are not directly part of the function signature but are assumed to be passed to the function internally within its scope, and `gcdinfo`, which is a list of objects each having attributes `gcd`, `tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, and `ifr2`.

Since the function does not contain a return statement, it does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer) and `parent` (an integer), and does not return any value.**
