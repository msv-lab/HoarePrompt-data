Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the integer number written on vertex `i`, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `visited` is a boolean list used for tracking visited nodes. Each element of `gcdinfo` is an object with attributes `gcd`, `tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, and `ifr2`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor, and `tor1` and `ifr1`/`tor2` and `ifr2` are used to track potential changes to maximize the gcd. The variable `visited[n]` is `True`.***
