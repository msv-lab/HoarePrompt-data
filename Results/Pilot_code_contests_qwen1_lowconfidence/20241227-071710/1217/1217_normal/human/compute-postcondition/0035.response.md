Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the integer number written on vertex `i`, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list used for tracking visited nodes, and `visited[n]` is `True`. If `parent != -1`, then `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated based on the new GCD calculation involving `gcdinfo[parent].gcd` and `a[n]`, and `gcdinfo[n].tor1`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1`, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` are set according to specific conditions. If `parent == -1`, no changes are made to `gcdinfo[n]`.***
