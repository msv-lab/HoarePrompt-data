Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the integer number written on vertex `i`, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list used for tracking visited nodes, and `visited[n]` is `True`. The current value of `parent` is not `-1`***
