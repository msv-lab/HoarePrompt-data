Postcondition: ***`newgcd` is the result of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`. If `newgcd < gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, then `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is set to `newgcd`, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is set to `a[n]`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is set to `0` or `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is set to `0`. Otherwise, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is set to `newgcd`, which is the GCD of `a[n]` and either `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` or `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` depending on their respective conditions, `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].tor1` or `gcdinfo[parent].tor2` accordingly, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` are updated as specified. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent of the current node in the recursive call, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the integer number written on vertex `i`, `graph` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a boolean list used for tracking visited nodes, and `visited[n]` is `True`.***
