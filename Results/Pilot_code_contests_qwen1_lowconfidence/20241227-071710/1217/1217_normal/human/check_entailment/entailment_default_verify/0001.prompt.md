You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya is very fond of graphs, especially trees. During his last trip to the forest Ilya found a very interesting tree rooted at vertex 1. There is an integer number written on each vertex of the tree; the number written on vertex i is equal to ai.

Ilya believes that the beauty of the vertex x is the greatest common divisor of all numbers written on the vertices on the path from the root to x, including this vertex itself. In addition, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. Now for each vertex Ilya wants to know the maximum possible beauty it can have.

For each vertex the answer must be considered independently.

The beauty of the root equals to number written on it.

Input

First line contains one integer number n — the number of vertices in tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105).

Next line contains n integer numbers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 2·105).

Each of next n - 1 lines contains two integer numbers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y), which means that there is an edge (x, y) in the tree.

Output

Output n numbers separated by spaces, where i-th number equals to maximum possible beauty of vertex i.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where the number in a vertex is changed to 0. According to the problem description, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. However, the program does not consider this possibility.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 2`
- `a = [6, 2]`
- Edges: `(1, 2)`

In this case, the maximum possible beauty of vertex 1 should still be 6 because if we change the value of vertex 2 to 0, the GCD along the path from the root to vertex 1 would remain 6. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program needs to include logic to handle the case where a vertex's value is set to 0 and recompute the GCD accordingly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a tree structure where each node has an associated integer value stored in the list `a`. It uses recursion to traverse the tree and update a data structure `gcdinfo` for each node. The `gcdinfo` for each node stores the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values of its subtree and additional information (`tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, `ifr2`) to track potential changes that can maximize the GCD. The function updates `gcdinfo` based on the GCD calculations involving the current node's value and the GCD of its parent node, as well as additional GCD calculations involving other relevant values.

After the function executes, for each node `n` in the tree:
- `visited[n]` is set to `True`, indicating that the node has been visited.
- The GCD of the subtree rooted at node `n` is stored in `gcdinfo[n].gcd`.
- Additional information (`tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, `ifr2`) in `gcdinfo[n]` is updated to reflect the potential changes that can maximize the GCD of the subtree.

If the parent of the current node is not the root (-1), the GCD of the current node's value and the GCD of its parent node is calculated. This GCD and related information are used to update `gcdinfo[n]`.

The function also ensures that the GCD and related information are propagated through the tree using recursion, starting from the root node.

Edge cases:
- If the parent of the current node is the root (i.e., `parent == -1`), no changes are made to `gcdinfo[n]`.
- If the current node has no neighbors (i.e., `graph[n]` is an empty list), the function simply returns without making any further recursive calls.

Missing functionality:
- The code assumes that `func_1` is defined elsewhere and correctly calculates the GCD. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, and its correctness is assumed.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
