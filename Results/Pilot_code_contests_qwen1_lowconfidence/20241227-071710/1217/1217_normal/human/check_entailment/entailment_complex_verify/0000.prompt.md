You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya is very fond of graphs, especially trees. During his last trip to the forest Ilya found a very interesting tree rooted at vertex 1. There is an integer number written on each vertex of the tree; the number written on vertex i is equal to ai.

Ilya believes that the beauty of the vertex x is the greatest common divisor of all numbers written on the vertices on the path from the root to x, including this vertex itself. In addition, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. Now for each vertex Ilya wants to know the maximum possible beauty it can have.

For each vertex the answer must be considered independently.

The beauty of the root equals to number written on it.

Input

First line contains one integer number n — the number of vertices in tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105).

Next line contains n integer numbers ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 2·105).

Each of next n - 1 lines contains two integer numbers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x ≠ y), which means that there is an edge (x, y) in the tree.

Output

Output n numbers separated by spaces, where i-th number equals to maximum possible beauty of vertex i.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the logic to update the maximum possible beauty for each vertex correctly. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Update Logic**: The function `func_2` does not properly update the `tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, and `ifr2` attributes of the `gcdinfo` objects. These attributes are supposed to keep track of the maximum possible beauty values, but the current implementation does not ensure that these values are updated correctly for each vertex.

2. **Missing Initialization**: The `gcdinfo` objects are not initialized properly before they are used. This can lead to undefined behavior and incorrect results.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for updating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and determining the maximum possible beauty is flawed. For example, if the GCD is updated incorrectly, the maximum possible beauty will also be incorrect.

To illustrate, consider a simple tree with three vertices and the following input:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( a = [6, 2, 3] \)
- Edges: \( (1, 2) \), \( (1, 3) \)

The expected output should be:
- Vertex 1: 6 (GCD of 6, 2, 3 is 1, but we can change 2 or 3 to 0 to get GCD 6)
- Vertex 2: 6 (GCD of 6, 3 is 3, but we can change 3 to 0 to get GCD 6)
- Vertex 3: 6 (GCD of 6, 2 is 2, but we can change 2 to 0 to get GCD 6)

However, the provided program does not correctly compute this and fails to update the maximum possible beauty values accurately. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

n = int(raw_input())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if b == 0 else func_1(b, a % b)
    #The program returns `a` if `b` is 0, otherwise it returns the result of `func_1(b, a % b)` where `a % b` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with parameters `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (`a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the original value of `a`. This function essentially computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns the GCD of the two input integers `a` and `b`.

Each element of `gcdinfo` is an object with attributes `gcd`, `tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, and `ifr2`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor, and `tor1` and `ifr1`/`tor2` and `ifr2` are used to track potential changes to maximize the gcd.

If `parent != -1`, then `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated based on the new GCD calculation involving `gcdinfo[parent].gcd` and `a[n]`, and `gcdinfo[n].tor1`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1`, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` are set according to specific conditions. If `parent == -1`, no changes are made to `gcdinfo[n]`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph[n]` must be an empty list, and for every `neigh` in `graph[n]`, `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called at least once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` processes a tree structure where each node has an associated integer value stored in the list `a`. It uses recursion to traverse the tree and update a data structure `gcdinfo` for each node. The `gcdinfo` for each node stores the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values of its subtree and additional information (`tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, `ifr2`) to track potential changes that can maximize the GCD. The function updates `gcdinfo` based on the GCD calculations involving the current node's value and the GCD of its parent node, as well as additional GCD calculations involving other relevant values.

After the function executes, for each node `n` in the tree:
- `visited[n]` is set to `True`, indicating that the node has been visited.
- The GCD of the subtree rooted at node `n` is stored in `gcdinfo[n].gcd`.
- Additional information (`tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, `ifr2`) in `gcdinfo[n]` is updated to reflect the potential changes that can maximize the GCD of the subtree.

If the parent of the current node is not the root (-1), the GCD of the current node's value and the GCD of its parent node is calculated. This GCD and related information are used to update `gcdinfo[n]`.

The function also ensures that the GCD and related information are propagated through the tree using recursion, starting from the root node.

Edge cases:
- If the parent of the current node is the root (i.e., `parent == -1`), no changes are made to `gcdinfo[n]`.
- If the current node has no neighbors (i.e., `graph[n]` is an empty list), the function simply returns without making any further recursive calls.

Missing functionality:
- The code assumes that `func_1` is defined elsewhere and correctly calculates the GCD. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, and its correctness is assumed.
