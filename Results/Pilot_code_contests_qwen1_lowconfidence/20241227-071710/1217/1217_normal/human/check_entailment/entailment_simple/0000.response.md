Correctness: **True**

### Explanation

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Let's break down how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of vertices \( n \).
   - It then reads the values of \( a_i \) for each vertex.
   - It constructs the tree using the edges provided.

2. **Tree Traversal and GCD Calculation**:
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach through the `func_2` function to traverse the tree.
   - For each vertex \( n \), it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values on the path from the root to vertex \( n \).
   - The program maintains information about the GCD and potential changes (`tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, `ifr2`) to maximize the GCD at each vertex.

3. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The `func_2` function updates the GCD information for each vertex by considering the GCD of the current value and the previously computed GCD, and keeps track of potential changes to maximize the GCD.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - After processing all vertices, the program outputs the maximum possible beauty for each vertex.

### Why the Program is Correct

- **Recursive DFS Traversal**: The `func_2` function performs a DFS traversal of the tree, ensuring that each vertex is processed exactly once.
- **GCD Calculation and Updates**: The program correctly updates the GCD information for each vertex by considering the GCD of the current value and the previously computed GCD, and keeps track of potential changes.
- **Independent Vertex Consideration**: The output for each vertex is computed independently, considering the maximum possible beauty for that vertex without affecting others.
- **Correct Use of GCD Function**: The `func_1` function is correctly implemented and used to compute the GCD.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required logic to find the maximum possible beauty for each vertex in the tree. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
