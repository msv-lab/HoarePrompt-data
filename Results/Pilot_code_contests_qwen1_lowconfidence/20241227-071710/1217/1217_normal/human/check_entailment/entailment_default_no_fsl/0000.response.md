Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the scenario where the number at a vertex can be changed to 0 to maximize the beauty of that vertex. Specifically, the code does not consider setting the value of a vertex to 0 and then calculating the GCD of the subtree with the modified value. 

To illustrate this, consider the following example:
- Input:
```
3
6 2 3
1 2
1 3
```
- Expected Output:
```
6 6 6
```
- Actual Output (with the provided code):
```
6 6 6
```

In this case, the code correctly calculates the GCD for each vertex based on the given values, but it does not account for the possibility of setting one of the values to 0 to potentially increase the GCD. For instance, if we set the value at vertex 3 to 0, the GCD of the path from the root to vertex 3 would be 6, which is the maximum possible beauty for vertex 3. However, the provided code does not perform this check, leading to an incorrect result.
