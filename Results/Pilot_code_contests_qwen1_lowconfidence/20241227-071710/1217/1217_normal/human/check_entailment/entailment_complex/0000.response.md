Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the scenario where the value at a node can be changed to 0 to maximize the beauty of the subtree. Specifically, the code only considers changing the value to the current node's value (`a[n]`) or to `0` (if `ifr1` or `ifr2` is 0). However, the problem description allows for changing the value of any node to 0, not just the current node. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
6 2 3
1 2
1 3
```
The expected output is `6 6 6` because changing the value of node 2 or node 3 to 0 will result in the GCD of the path from the root to node 3 being 6.

However, the code does not consider the possibility of setting the value of node 2 or node 3 to 0, which would correctly maximize the beauty for those nodes. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
