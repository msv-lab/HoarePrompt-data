Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where the number in a vertex is changed to 0. According to the problem description, Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0 or leave all vertices unchanged. However, the program does not consider this possibility.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 2`
- `a = [6, 2]`
- Edges: `(1, 2)`

In this case, the maximum possible beauty of vertex 1 should still be 6 because if we change the value of vertex 2 to 0, the GCD along the path from the root to vertex 1 would remain 6. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program needs to include logic to handle the case where a vertex's value is set to 0 and recompute the GCD accordingly.
