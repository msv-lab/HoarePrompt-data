Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the grasshopper's path is finite or infinite based on the given problem description. The output hints further confirm that the program handles all cases as expected, updating the position and checking the bounds appropriately. The program does not encounter any edge cases that would make it incorrect according to the problem constraints and the provided input format. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
