You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Artem found a grasshopper. He brought it to his house and constructed a jumping area for him.

The area looks like a strip of cells 1 × n. Each cell contains the direction for the next jump and the length of that jump. Grasshopper starts in the first cell and follows the instructions written on the cells. Grasshopper stops immediately if it jumps out of the strip. Now Artem wants to find out if this will ever happen.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — length of the strip. 

Next line contains a string of length n which consists of characters "<" and ">" only, that provide the direction of the jump from the corresponding cell. Next line contains n integers di (1 ≤ di ≤ 109) — the length of the jump from the i-th cell.

Output

Print "INFINITE" (without quotes) if grasshopper will continue his jumps forever. Otherwise print "FINITE" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

2
&gt;&lt;
1 2


Output

FINITE


Input

3
&gt;&gt;&lt;
2 1 1


Output

INFINITE

Note

In the first sample grasshopper starts from the first cell and jumps to the right on the next cell. When he is in the second cell he needs to jump two cells left so he will jump out of the strip.

Second sample grasshopper path is 1 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 and so on. The path is infinite.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    field = raw_input()
    power = map(int, raw_input().split())
    pos = 0
    while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:
        (power[pos], pos) = (0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos])
    print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining whether the grasshopper's path is finite or infinite based on the given problem description. The program reads the input, simulates the grasshopper's jumps, and checks if it stays within the strip bounds or goes out of it. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the position `pos` to 0, representing the starting cell.
2. **Simulation Loop**: It enters a loop that continues as long as the position is within bounds (0 ≤ pos < n) and the current jump length is non-zero.
3. **Jump Calculation**: Inside the loop, it calculates the new position based on the direction ('<' or '>') and updates the current cell's jump length to 0 to avoid revisiting it.
4. **Termination Condition**: After exiting the loop, it checks if the position is still within bounds. If yes, it prints "FINITE"; otherwise, it prints "INFINITE".

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all described cases correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func()` takes three inputs: an integer `n`, a string `field` of length `n` containing only '>' and '<' characters, and a list `power` of `n` integers. It iterates through the `power` list, updating the position `pos` based on the direction indicated by each character in `field`. If `power[pos]` becomes zero during iteration or if the loop exits because `pos` is out of bounds, it prints 'FINITE'. Otherwise, if the loop continues without these conditions being met, it prints 'INFINITE'. The function does not modify the input parameters directly; instead, it updates the `power` list and the `pos` variable. Potential edge cases include when `pos` is already zero at the start or when the loop exits due to `pos` reaching the boundaries of the `field` and `power` lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
