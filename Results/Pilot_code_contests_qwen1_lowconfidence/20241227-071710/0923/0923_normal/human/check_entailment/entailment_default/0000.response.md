Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not correctly detect when the grasshopper will continue its jumps forever. Let's analyze why:

1. **Infinite Loop Case**: The code should identify scenarios where the grasshopper enters a cycle and keeps jumping indefinitely. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   4
   &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;
   1 1 1 1
   ```
   In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 0, jumps to position 1, then to position 2, then to position 3, and then back to position 2, and so on. The grasshopper will keep cycling between positions 2 and 3. The current code does not detect this cycle and will incorrectly print 'FINITE'.

2. **Boundary Handling**: The code checks if `pos` is within the bounds of the strip, but it does not explicitly check if the grasshopper has entered a cycle. To fix this, you would need to use a set to track visited positions and detect cycles.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses the issue:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos = 0
    visited = set()

    while 0 <= pos < n and pos not in visited:
        visited.add(pos)
        (power[pos], pos) = (0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos])

    print('INFINITE' if pos in visited else 'FINITE')

func()
```

This corrected version uses a set to keep track of visited positions, ensuring that if the grasshopper revisits a position, it will detect the cycle and print 'INFINITE'.
