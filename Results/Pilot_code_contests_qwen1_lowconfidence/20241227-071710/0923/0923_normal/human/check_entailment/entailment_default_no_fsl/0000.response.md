Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to correctly identify the infinite loop scenario for certain input patterns.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  &gt;&lt;&gt;
  1 1 1
  ```

According to the problem description, the grasshopper should keep moving in an infinite loop because each jump brings it back to the previous position. However, the current implementation does not detect this scenario and will incorrectly print 'FINITE'.

The issue lies in the termination condition of the while loop. The loop exits when either `pos` goes out of bounds or `power[pos]` becomes zero. In the given test case, the grasshopper keeps moving back and forth between positions 0 and 2, never reaching the end of the strip or having `power[pos]` become zero.

To fix this, the code should detect when the grasshopper enters a cycle and does not escape. One way to achieve this is by using a set to track visited positions. If a position is visited again, it indicates an infinite loop.

Here's an updated version of the function that correctly handles this case:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    visited = set()
    pos = 0
    
    while 0 <= pos < n and pos not in visited:
        visited.add(pos)
        (power[pos], pos) = (0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos])
    
    print('INFINITE' if pos in visited else 'FINITE')
```

This updated function uses a set to track visited positions and correctly identifies the infinite loop scenario, ensuring the program works as expected for all potential cases.
