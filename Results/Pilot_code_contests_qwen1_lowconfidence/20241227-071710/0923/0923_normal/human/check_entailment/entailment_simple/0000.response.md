Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the length of the strip.
   - It then reads a string `field` of length `n` containing `>` and `<` characters indicating the direction of the jump.
   - Finally, it reads a list of `n` integers `power` indicating the length of the jump from each cell.

2. **Jump Logic**:
   - The program initializes the position `pos` to 0.
   - It uses a `while` loop to simulate the jumps until the grasshopper either leaves the strip or the jump length from the current cell becomes 0.
   - Inside the loop, the position `pos` is updated based on the direction (`>` or `<`) indicated by `field[pos]`. Specifically, if the character is `>`, `pos` is incremented; if it is `<`, `pos` is decremented.
   - The jump length `power[pos]` is set to 0 after the jump, effectively marking the cell as visited and preventing further jumps from that cell.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - After exiting the loop, the program checks whether the grasshopper is still within the strip bounds (`0 <= pos < n`).
   - If `pos` is within the bounds, it means the grasshopper will keep jumping indefinitely, hence it prints "INFINITE".
   - If `pos` is out of bounds, it means the grasshopper has jumped out of the strip, hence it prints "FINITE".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all cases where the grasshopper could potentially leave the strip, including situations where the grasshopper might jump outside the strip boundaries due to the directions and lengths provided.
   - The program also correctly accounts for the scenario where the grasshopper visits all cells and eventually leaves the strip.

Since the program correctly simulates the grasshopper's jumps according to the problem description and outputs "FINITE" or "INFINITE" based on the final position of the grasshopper, it is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
