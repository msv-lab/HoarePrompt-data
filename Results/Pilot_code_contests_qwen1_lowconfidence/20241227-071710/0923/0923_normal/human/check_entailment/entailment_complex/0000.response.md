Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the length of the strip.
   - It then reads a string `field` of length `n` containing only `>` and `<` characters.
   - Finally, it reads a list of integers `power` of length `n`.

2. **State Initialization**:
   - The initial state includes `n`, `field`, and `power` as per the problem description.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program initializes `pos` to `0`.
   - It enters a while loop that continues as long as `pos` is within bounds (`0 <= pos < n`) and `power[pos]` is non-zero.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `power[pos]` to `0` and calculates the new position `pos` based on the direction indicated by `field[pos]`. If the character is `>`, `pos` is incremented by the value of `power[pos]`; if the character is `<`, `pos` is decremented by the value of `power[pos]`.

4. **Loop Termination Conditions**:
   - The loop terminates if `pos` goes out of bounds or if `power[pos]` becomes zero.
   - If the loop exits because `pos` is within bounds (`0 <= pos < n`), it prints 'FINITE'.
   - If the loop exits because `pos` is out of bounds (`pos` is either `-1` or `n`), it prints 'INFINITE'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles scenarios where `pos` might start at `0` or might exit the loop due to `pos` reaching the boundaries of the `field` and `power` lists.
   - Since the input is assumed to be valid (as per the problem constraints), the program does not need to handle invalid inputs.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the logic required to determine whether the grasshopper's path is finite or infinite, following the problem description perfectly. Thus, the program is correct.
