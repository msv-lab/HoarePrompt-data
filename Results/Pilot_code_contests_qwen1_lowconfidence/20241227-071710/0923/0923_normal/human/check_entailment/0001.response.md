Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining whether the grasshopper's path is finite or infinite based on the given problem description. The program reads the input, simulates the grasshopper's jumps, and checks if it stays within the strip bounds or goes out of it. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the position `pos` to 0, representing the starting cell.
2. **Simulation Loop**: It enters a loop that continues as long as the position is within bounds (0 ≤ pos < n) and the current jump length is non-zero.
3. **Jump Calculation**: Inside the loop, it calculates the new position based on the direction ('<' or '>') and updates the current cell's jump length to 0 to avoid revisiting it.
4. **Termination Condition**: After exiting the loop, it checks if the position is still within bounds. If yes, it prints "FINITE"; otherwise, it prints "INFINITE".

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all described cases correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.
