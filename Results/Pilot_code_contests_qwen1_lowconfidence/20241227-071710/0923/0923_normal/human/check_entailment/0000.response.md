Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip and does not reset the position to the start if it tries to jump out. Specifically, if the grasshopper reaches the last cell and needs to jump further right, or if it reaches the first cell and needs to jump further left, the program does not account for this scenario and will not detect that the grasshopper has jumped out of bounds. This leads to incorrect behavior, as the program will not terminate in such cases, violating the requirement to stop if the grasshopper jumps out of the strip.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
&gt;&gt;&lt;
1 2 1
```

In this case, the grasshopper starts at position 0 and follows these steps:
1. Jump 1 cell to the right, reaching position 1.
2. Jump 2 cells to the right, reaching position 3, which is out of bounds.

However, the program will not detect this and will continue to cycle through the cells without stopping, leading to incorrect output.
