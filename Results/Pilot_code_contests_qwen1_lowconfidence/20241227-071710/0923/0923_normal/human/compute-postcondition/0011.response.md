The code snippet checks if the position `pos` is within the bounds of the range `[0, n)`. If `0 <= pos < n`, it prints 'INFINITE', otherwise it prints 'FINITE'. However, the value of `pos` does not change in this code snippet; it only checks the condition.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `pos` is already within the bounds `[0, n)` because it is stated that `pos` is within the bounds of `field` and `power`, and `power[pos]` is `0`. Therefore, the condition `0 <= pos < n` will be true, and the code will print 'INFINITE'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`, the third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\), `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line, `power[pos]` is `0`, the output is 'INFINITE'.**
