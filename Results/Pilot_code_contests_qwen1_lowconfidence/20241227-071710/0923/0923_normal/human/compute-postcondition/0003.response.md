`pos` is assigned the value `0`. This initializes the variable `pos` to `0`, but does not affect the values of other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`, the third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\), `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line, `pos` is 0.**
