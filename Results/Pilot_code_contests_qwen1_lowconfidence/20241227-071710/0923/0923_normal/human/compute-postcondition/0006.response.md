To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0`.

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as both conditions are true: `0 <= pos < n` and `power[pos] != 0`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, either `pos` must change in a way that satisfies `0 <= pos < n` or `power[pos]` must become non-zero.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `n` is an integer read from input.
   - `field` is a string read from input.
   - The second line is a string of `>` and `<` characters of length `n`.
   - The third line is a list of `n` integers `di` where each `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.
   - `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line.
   - `pos` is `0`.
   - `power[pos]` is `0`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes One More Time**:
   - Since `pos` is currently `0`, and `0 <= 0 < n` is always true given that `n` is an integer and `pos` starts at `0`, the first part of the condition (`0 <= pos < n`) is already satisfied.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `power[pos]` needs to become non-zero. Given that `power[pos]` is currently `0`, we need to adjust this state.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure `power[pos]` becomes non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`, the third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\), `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line, `pos` is `0`, `power[pos]` is no longer `0`**.
