Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. `power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`

   - Initially, `power[pos]` is non-zero (as per the precondition).
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.
   - Since `power[pos]` is non-zero, `(2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1)` will evaluate to either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `field[pos]` is `'>'` or `'<'`.
   - `power[pos]` is then set to `0`.

After executing the code, the variables `power[pos]` and `pos` have changed as follows:
- `power[pos]` is now `0`.
- `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`. Since `power[pos]` is `0`, the new value of `pos` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`, the third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\), `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line, `power[pos]` is `0`, `pos` is unchanged, `power[pos]` is no longer `0`**.
