The code updates the value of `power[pos]` to `0` and changes the value of `pos` based on the condition in the assignment. Specifically, `pos` is updated by adding `2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1` multiplied by the current value of `power[pos]`.

Let's break this down:

1. `power[pos]` is set to `0`.
2. The value of `pos` is updated by the expression `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.

Since `power[pos]` is set to `0`, the expression simplifies to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * 0`, which means `pos` remains unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer read from input.
- `field` is a string read from input.
- The second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`.
- The third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\).
- `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line.
- `pos` is `0`.
- `power[0]` is not `0`.

After executing the code, the updated values are:
- `power[pos]` is now `0`.
- `pos` remains `0` because the expression for updating `pos` evaluates to `0`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`, the third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\), `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line, `pos` is `0`, `power[pos]` is `0`.**
