Functionality: **The function `func()` takes three inputs: an integer `n`, a string `field` of length `n` containing only '>' and '<' characters, and a list `power` of `n` integers. It iterates through the `power` list, updating the position `pos` based on the direction indicated by each character in `field`. If `power[pos]` becomes zero during iteration or if the loop exits because `pos` is out of bounds, it prints 'FINITE'. Otherwise, if the loop continues without these conditions being met, it prints 'INFINITE'. The function does not modify the input parameters directly; instead, it updates the `power` list and the `pos` variable. Potential edge cases include when `pos` is already zero at the start or when the loop exits due to `pos` reaching the boundaries of the `field` and `power` lists.**

**Missing functionality or considerations:**
- The initial value of `pos` is set to 0, which might lead to an incorrect initial check if `pos` is updated to 0 within the first iteration.
- The function assumes valid input types and formats, but no error handling is provided for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values in `power` or non-'>' and '<' characters in `field`).
