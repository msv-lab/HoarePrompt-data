Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`, the third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\), `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line, `power[pos]` is `0`, `pos` is within the bounds of `field` and `power`, `pos` is no longer `0` or reaches the boundary of the array**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `0 <= pos < n` and `power[pos] != 0`.
- In each iteration, `power[pos]` is set to `0`, and `pos` is updated based on the direction indicated by `field[pos]`. Specifically, if `field[pos]` is `'>`', `pos` increases by `2 * power[pos]`, and if `field[pos]` is `<`, `pos` decreases by `2 * power[pos]`.
- After the loop terminates, `power[pos]` will be `0` because the loop condition ensures that `power[pos]` is set to `0` in every iteration.
- The loop will terminate when either `pos` goes out of bounds (`pos < 0` or `pos >= n`) or `power[pos]` becomes `0`.
- Therefore, `pos` will be within the bounds of `field` and `power` when the loop ends, and it will not be `0` or reach the boundary of the array if it has moved at least once.
