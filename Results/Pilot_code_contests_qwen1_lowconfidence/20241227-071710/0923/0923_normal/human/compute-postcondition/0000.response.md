`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads an integer from the input. The second line and the list of integers `di` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n is the integer read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length n, and the third line is a list of n integers `di` such that 1 â‰¤ `di` â‰¤ 109.

Output State: **n is the integer read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length n, and the third line is a list of n integers `di` such that 1 â‰¤ `di` â‰¤ 109.**
