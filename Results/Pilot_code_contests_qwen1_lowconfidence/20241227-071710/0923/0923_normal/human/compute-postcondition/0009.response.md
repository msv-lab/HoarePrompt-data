Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`

   - This line updates two things: `power[pos]` and `pos`.
   - `power[pos]` is set to `0`.
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.

   Given the condition `(2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1)`, this will be:
   - `1` if `field[pos] == '>'` (since `2 * 1 - 1 = 1`)
   - `-1` if `field[pos] == '<` (since `2 * 0 - 1 = -1`)

   Since `power[pos]` is being set to `0`, the update to `pos` will always be `0` regardless of the value of `field[pos]`. Therefore, `pos` remains unchanged.

So, after executing the code, the changes are:
- `power[pos]` is set to `0`.
- `pos` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, the updated values are:
- `n` is an integer read from input.
- `field` is a string read from input.
- The second line is a string consisting of `>` and `<` characters of length `n`.
- The third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\).
- `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line.
- `power[pos]` is non-zero initially, now `power[pos]` is `0`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`, the third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\), `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line, `power[pos]` is `0`, `pos` is unchanged**.
