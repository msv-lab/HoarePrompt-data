The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the problem statement, it seems that the function should process three pieces of data: an integer `n`, a string of length `n` consisting of '>' and '<' characters, and a list of `n` integers. 

Given the structure of the problem, let's reframe the description:

- The first line of input provides an integer `n`.
- The second line of input provides a string of length `n` consisting of '>' and '<' characters.
- The third line of input provides a list of `n` integers, each ranging from 1 to 10^9.

The function processes these three pieces of data and returns a result based on the provided string and list of integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, a string of length `n` consisting of '>' and '<' characters, and a list of `n` integers. It returns a result based on the provided string and list of integers.**
