The code `field = raw_input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `field`. The values of `n` and the list `di` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from input, field is the string read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length n, and the third line is a list of n integers `di` such that 1 â‰¤ `di` â‰¤ 10^9.**
