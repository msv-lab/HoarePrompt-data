The code `power = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting iterable to the variable `power`. 

- `n` was previously an integer read from input.
- `field` was previously a string read from input.
- The second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`.
- The third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\).

After executing the code, the `power` variable will contain an iterable of integers converted from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `field` is a string read from input, the second line is a string consisting of '>' and '<' characters of length `n`, the third line is a list of `n` integers `di` such that \(1 \leq di \leq 10^9\), `power` is an iterable of integers from the input line.**
