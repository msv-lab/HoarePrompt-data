#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the coordinates of stickers from standard input, calculates the intersection points of circles centered at these coordinates with a radius slightly larger than 1, and then determines the maximum number of stickers that can overlap at any single point within the 10x10 origami paper. The function does not accept any parameters and prints the result to standard output. The function handles the case where multiple stickers can overlap at the same point and ensures that the calculated intersection points are within the bounds of the origami paper. Edge cases include scenarios where no stickers overlap or where the input data might be invalid (e.g., negative coordinates or coordinates outside the 10x10 range).
