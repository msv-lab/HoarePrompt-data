Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if the conditions for `cp2` hold. Since the if condition `i == j` is true, these assignments are guaranteed to be executed.***
