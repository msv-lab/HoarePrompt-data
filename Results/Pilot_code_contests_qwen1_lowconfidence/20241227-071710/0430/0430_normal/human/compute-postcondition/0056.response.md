Given the initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State: 
- `j` is 2
- `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`
- `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`
- `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`
- `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds
- `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`
- All other variables retain their original values and relationships.

Code Snippet:
```python
distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The `distance` variable is updated to be the Euclidean distance between points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
- This calculation does not affect the values of `x2`, `y2`, `cp1`, `cp2`, `al`, or `cross_points`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`, `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds, and `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. All other variables retain their original values and relationships.**
