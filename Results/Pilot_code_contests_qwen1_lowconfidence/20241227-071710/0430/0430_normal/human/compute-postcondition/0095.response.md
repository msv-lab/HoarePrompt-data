Postcondition: ***`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, and `cross_points` remains unchanged since the condition `i == j` is met, which does not change the values of any variables.***
