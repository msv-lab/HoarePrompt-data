Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid calculated intersection points where the distance between the points in `data` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and the coordinates of the calculated points are within the range [0.0, 10.0], `i` is `num_data - 1`, `j` is any value from `0` to `num_data - 1` (excluding `i`), `x1` and `y1` are the elements of `data[i]`, `x2` and `y2` are the elements of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all pairs of points in the `data` list.
- For each pair of points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, the loop calculates the Euclidean distance between them.
- If the distance is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, the loop calculates two possible intersection points (`cp1` and `cp2`) based on the geometric properties of the circles centered at the points with radius `RADIUS_2`.
- Only if the calculated intersection points fall within the range [0.0, 10.0] for both coordinates, they are appended to the `cross_points` list.
- After the loop completes, `cross_points` will contain all such valid intersection points from each iteration that satisfy the conditions.
- The final state of the loop will reflect that the `cross_points` list contains all valid calculated intersection points, and the loop has iterated over all possible pairs of points in the `data` list.
