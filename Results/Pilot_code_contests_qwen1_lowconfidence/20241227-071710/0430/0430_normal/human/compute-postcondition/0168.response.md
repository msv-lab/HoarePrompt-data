Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration. Since the if condition `i == j` is false (as `i` is `num_data - 2` and `j` is `2`, they are not equal), the else part does not execute, and the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
