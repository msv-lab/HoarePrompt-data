According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_data`. The loop will execute as long as `num_data` is greater than 0. Given the initial state:

- `data` is a list containing tuples.
- `num_data` must be greater than 0 (this is already given and does not need adjustment).
- `cross_points` is an empty list.
- `x1` is the first element of `data[i]`.
- `y1` is the second element of `data[i]`.

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `j` is set to 0, and the loop will continue as long as `j < num_data`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
