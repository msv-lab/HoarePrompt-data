The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state of the program. All the variables retain their original values and relationships as per the precondition.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`, `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds, and `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`.**
