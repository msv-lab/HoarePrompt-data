The given code initializes an empty list named `data`. This does not assign any value to `data` but simply creates it. The values of `n`, `num_data`, `RADIUS`, and `RADIUS_2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `data` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `num_data` is an integer read from standard input, `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12, `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12, `data` is an empty list**
