The code `cross_points.append(cp2)` appends the value of `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. Since `cross_points` initially contains one element, `cp1`, appending `cp2` will add `cp2` as a second element in the list. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `j` is 1
- `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`
- `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`
- `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`
- `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds
- `cross_points` is now a list containing two elements: `cp1` and `cp2`

Output State: **`j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds, and `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2`.**
