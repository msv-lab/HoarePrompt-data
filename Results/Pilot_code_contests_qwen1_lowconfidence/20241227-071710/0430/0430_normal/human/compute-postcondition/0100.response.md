The code calculates `al` using the formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. This formula assumes that `distance` is the length of a line segment and `al` is the angle opposite this segment in an isosceles triangle with two sides of length `distance`. However, since the exact values of `distance` and `x2, y2` are not provided, we can only express `al` in terms of `distance`.

Given the initial state, no other variables are affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `cross_points` remains unchanged, and `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.**
