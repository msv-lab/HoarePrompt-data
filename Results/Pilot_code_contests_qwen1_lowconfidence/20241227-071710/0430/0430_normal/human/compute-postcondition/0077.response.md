Postcondition: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. The distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`**
