Postcondition: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, and `cp2` is either assigned the value of `(x1 + \cos(\text{th} + \text{al}), y1 + \sin(\text{th} + \text{al}))` (if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`) or `(x1 + \cos(\text{th} - \text{al}), y1 + \sin(\text{th} - \text{al}))` (otherwise). The previous values of `i`, `j`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`, and `cp1` remain unchanged.**
