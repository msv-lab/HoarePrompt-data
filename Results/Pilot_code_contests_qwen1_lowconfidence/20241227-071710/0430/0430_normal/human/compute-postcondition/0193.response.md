Postcondition: ***`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is either 3 or remains 2, `data` must contain at least two tuples, and `(cx, cy)` is a point such that the Euclidean distance from `(cx, cy)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`. If the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true, then `count` becomes 3. Otherwise, `count` remains 2.***
