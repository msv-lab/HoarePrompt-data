Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `cp1` is `x2` and `cp2` is `y2`. Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, and `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)` where `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` and `x1` and `y1` are assumed to be `x2` and `y2` respectively.***
