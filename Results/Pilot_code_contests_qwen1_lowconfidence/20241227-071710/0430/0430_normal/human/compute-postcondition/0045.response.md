The code changes the value of `cp2` from its original definition to `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`. The original value of `cp2` was defined as `(x1 + math.cos(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) - al), y1 + math.sin(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) - al))`. After this assignment, the new value of `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

The other variables (`j`, `x2`, `y2`, `cp1`, `distance`, `al`, `th`, and `x1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`**
