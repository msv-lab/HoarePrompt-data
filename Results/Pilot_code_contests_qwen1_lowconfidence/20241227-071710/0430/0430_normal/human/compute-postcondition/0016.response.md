The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since the `continue` statement is encountered, the values of the variables `cross_points`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the loop will proceed to the next iteration. The initial values of `data`, `num_data`, `cross_points`, `j`, and `i` are known.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0, and the current value of `i` is equal to `j`**
