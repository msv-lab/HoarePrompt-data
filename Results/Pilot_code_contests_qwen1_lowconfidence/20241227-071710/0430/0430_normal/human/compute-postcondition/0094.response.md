The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop was specified, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values or the overall state of the program beyond indicating that the next iteration would begin. All variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, and `cross_points` contains either `[cp1]` or `[cp1, cp2]` where `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, and optionally `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`.**
