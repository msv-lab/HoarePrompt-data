The code assigns the values of `data[j]` to `x2` and `y2`. Given the initial state, `j` is equal to `num_data`, so `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values of `data[num_data]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp2` is appended similarly under certain conditions, and `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions.**
