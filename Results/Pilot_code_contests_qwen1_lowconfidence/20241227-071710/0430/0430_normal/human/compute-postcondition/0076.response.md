The code calculates the distance using the `math.hypot` function, which computes the Euclidean distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are not provided in the initial state, but we know that `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]` and `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`.

The value of `distance` is calculated but does not affect any of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `distance` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`**
