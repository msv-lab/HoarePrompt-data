The code assigns `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. However, the values of `x1` and `y1` are not explicitly defined in the given initial state. We only know that `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]` and `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`. Since `x1` and `y1` are not defined, they are assumed to be the same as `x2` and `y2` respectively. Therefore, `cp1` and `cp2` are assigned the values of `x2` and `y2`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `cp1` is `x2`, `cp2` is `y2`, and `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` where `x1` and `y1` are assumed to be `x2` and `y2` respectively.**
