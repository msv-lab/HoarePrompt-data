Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `count` is the number of tuples in `data` for which the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true.
   - `data` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `(cx, cy)` is a point such that the Euclidean distance from `(cx, cy)` to any `(x, y)` in `data` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.
   - `max_overlap` is now equal to `count` if `max_overlap < count`. Otherwise, `max_overlap` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(cx, cy)` in `cross_points`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - For each `(cx, cy)` in `cross_points`, the loop body will check the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` for each tuple `(x, y)` in `data`.
   - If the condition is true, `count` will be incremented.
   - After processing all tuples in `data`, `count` will be updated if it exceeds the current value of `max_overlap`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cross_points` must still contain at least one tuple.
   - `data` must still contain at least one tuple because the loop relies on checking this condition against `data`.
   - The value of `max_overlap` will remain unchanged unless another iteration results in a higher `count`.
   - `count` will be reset to zero at the start of the new iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `cross_points` must still contain at least one tuple.
- `data` must still contain at least one tuple.
- `count` will be reset to zero at the start of the new iteration.
- `max_overlap` will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is 0, `max_overlap` remains unchanged.**
