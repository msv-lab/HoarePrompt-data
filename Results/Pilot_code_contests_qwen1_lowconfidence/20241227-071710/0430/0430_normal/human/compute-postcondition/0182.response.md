Let's analyze the loop and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over each index `j` from `0` to `num_data - 1` (inclusive). However, it skips the iteration when `i == j`. Therefore, `i` will always be `num_data - 2`, and `j` will take every value from `0` to `num_data - 1` except `i`.

For each iteration, the loop calculates the distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, where `x1` and `y1` are the coordinates of the point at `data[i]`, and `x2` and `y2` are the coordinates of the point at `data[j]`. If the distance is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, it calculates the intersection points `cp1` and `cp2` using trigonometric functions and appends them to the `cross_points` list if they fall within the specified range `[0.0, 10.0]`.

### Final State Determination
After all iterations of the loop have completed, the `cross_points` list will contain all the valid intersection points calculated during the iterations. Since `i` is fixed at `num_data - 2`, and `j` iterates through all other indices, we need to consider the final state of `cross_points`.

- **`i`**: Remains `num_data - 2`.
- **`j`**: Iterates through all values from `0` to `num_data - 1` (except `i`), so there is no specific final value for `j`.
- **`cross_points`**: Contains all valid intersection points calculated during the iterations, where each point satisfies the conditions `distance <= RADIUS_2` and `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`.

### Output State
Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is any value from `0` to `num_data - 1` (excluding `i`), and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated intersection points from each iteration, where the distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and both coordinates of the calculated points are within the range [0.0, 10.0].**
