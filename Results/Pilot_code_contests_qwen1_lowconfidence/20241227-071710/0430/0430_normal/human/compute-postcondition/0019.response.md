The code snippet calculates the Euclidean distance between two points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`. However, the value of `x1` and `y1` are not provided in the initial state, and they are not defined anywhere in the given code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of the `distance` variable. But we know that `distance` will be assigned the value of the Euclidean distance formula using `x2` and `y2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `distance` is calculated as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` where `x1` and `y1` are undefined.**
