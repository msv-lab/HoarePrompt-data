The code updates the value of `cp2` based on the current values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`. The previous values of these variables are known, so we can calculate the new value of `cp2`.

- `x1` and `y1` are derived from `data[2]`, so `x2` and `y2` are the coordinates from `data[2]`.
- `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, where `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.

Given these, we can compute `cp2`:

\[ cp2 = x1 + \cos(\text{th} - \text{al}), y1 + \sin(\text{th} - \text{al}) \]

Since the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al` are not specified, we express `cp2` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`**
