The code updates the value of `cp2`. Initially, `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`. After the code runs, `cp2` is updated to `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states:
- `j` is 2
- `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`
- `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`
- `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`
- `cp2` is now `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`
- `al` is `math.acos(distance)`

Output State: **`j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`**
