Postcondition: **`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is the number of tuples in `data` for which the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `(cx, cy)` is a point such that the Euclidean distance from `(cx, cy)` to any `(x, y)` in `data` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, and `max_overlap` is less than `count`.**
