The code sets `max_overlap` to 0, which initializes this variable. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `max_overlap` and keep the values of all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid calculated intersection points, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `j` is any value from `0` to `num_data - 1` (excluding `i`), `x1` and `y1` are the elements of `data[i]`, `x2` and `y2` are the elements of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, and `max_overlap` is `0`.**
