First, let's identify the changes in the code:

- The initial value of `al` is defined as `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds.
- The new value of `al` is defined as `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 2,
- `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`,
- `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`,
- `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`,
- `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`,
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`,
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds,
- `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`,
- `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.

Now, the new definition of `al` is used, which changes the value of `al` from `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` to `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.

Therefore, the updated value of `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`, `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` if the distance condition holds, `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`**.
