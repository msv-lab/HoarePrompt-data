According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_data`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `num_data` is greater than 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `data` is a tuple containing floats (starting with 'float(s1)', 'float(s2)', ..., ending with 1.5, 2.3), and `num_data` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_data` must still be greater than 1. Since the loop has already executed once, `num_data` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `num_data` must be greater than 0.

State: **`data` is `('float(s1)', 'float(s2)', ..., 1.5, 2.3); `num_data` must be greater than 0**
