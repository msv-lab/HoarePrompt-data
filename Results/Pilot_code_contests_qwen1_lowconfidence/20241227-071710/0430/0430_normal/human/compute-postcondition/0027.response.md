The code updates the value of `cp2` using the values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`. However, `x1` and `y1` are not defined in the initial state. We cannot directly calculate these values from the given information. Therefore, the values of `x1` and `y1` remain unknown. The other variables are updated as follows:

- `cp2` is calculated as `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

Since the values of `x1` and `y1` are not specified, we cannot provide their exact numerical values. However, we know that `th` is `math.atan2(y2, x2)` and `al` is `math.acos(distance)`. Thus, the updated values are:

- `x2` remains the first element of `data[0]`.
- `y2` remains the second element of `data[0]`.
- `th` remains `math.atan2(y2, x2)`.
- `al` remains `math.acos(distance)`.
- `cp1` remains `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`.
- `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2, x2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))**
