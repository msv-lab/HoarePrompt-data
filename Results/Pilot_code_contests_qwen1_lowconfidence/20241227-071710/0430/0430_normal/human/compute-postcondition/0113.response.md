The code updates the variable `distance` to be the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`. Given the initial state, we know that `x2` and `y2` are the second elements of `data[num_data]`, and the points `(x1, y1)` are the first element of `data[num_data]`. Therefore, `distance` is now calculated as the Euclidean distance between these two points.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data]`, `distance` is math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1]), `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp2` is appended similarly under certain conditions, and `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions.**
