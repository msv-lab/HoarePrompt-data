The code snippet appends `cp1` to the `cross_points` list. Based on the initial state, `cp1` is defined as `x2` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x2` and `y1` equals `y2`, otherwise `cp1` is calculated using the given formulas involving `math.atan2`, `math.acos`, `math.hypot`, and trigonometric functions.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `num_data - 2`
- `j` is `2`
- `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`
- `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`
- `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration

If `x1` equals `x2` and `y1` equals `y2`, then `cp1` is `x2` and `cp2` is `y2`. Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, and `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`, where `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, and `x1` and `y1` are assumed to be `x2` and `y2` respectively.

Since `x1` and `y1` are assumed to be `x2` and `y2` respectively, and there is no condition where `x1` does not equal `x2` and `y1` does not equal `y2`, `cp1` will be `x2` and `cp2` will be `y2`.

Therefore, `cp1` will be `x2` and `cp2` will be `y2`, and `cross_points` will contain all previous points plus the new point `[x2, y2]`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration plus `[x2, y2]`**
