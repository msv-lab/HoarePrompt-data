The code `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` calculates the value of `al` using the formula involving `distance`. Since `distance` is defined as `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`, the value of `al` is calculated based on this `distance`.

Let's break down the calculation:

- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between two points.
- `al` is calculated as `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.

Since `distance` is known, we can calculate `al` directly. However, the exact value of `al` depends on the specific value of `distance`, which is not provided here. For now, we'll keep it in terms of `distance`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `num_data`, `j`, `i`, `x2`, `y2`, `cross_points`, `cp1`, `cp2`, and `th` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data][0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` and `cp2` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions, `th` is the angle in radians between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))**
