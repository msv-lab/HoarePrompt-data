The code sets `count` to 0, which changes its value from the initial state where `count` was equal to `max_overlap`. The `max_overlap` remains unchanged and is still equal to the initial value of `count`. The `data` and `cross_points` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`max_overlap` is equal to the initial `count`, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is 0.**
