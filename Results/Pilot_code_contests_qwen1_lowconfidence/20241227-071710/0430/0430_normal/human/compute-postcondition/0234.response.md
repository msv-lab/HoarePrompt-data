The code `print(max_overlap)` simply prints the value of `max_overlap`. Since `max_overlap` is already defined as the maximum value of `count` over all iterations of the loop and does not get modified by this line of code, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`data` and `cross_points`) are not affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`max_overlap` is the maximum value of `count` over all iterations of the loop, `data` must contain at least one tuple, and `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple.**
