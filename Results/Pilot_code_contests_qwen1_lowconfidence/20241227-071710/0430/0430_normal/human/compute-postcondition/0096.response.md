The code updates the values of `x2` and `y2` to be the elements from `data[j]`. Since `j` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` and `y2` now refer to the last element in the list `data`.

- Initially, `x2` was the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
- Initially, `y2` was the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`.

After executing the line `x2, y2 = data[j]`, `x2` and `y2` are updated to be the first and second elements of `data[num_data - 1]`, respectively.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, and `cross_points` remains unchanged.**
