The given Python code initializes an empty list `cross_points`. This does not affect the existing values of `data` or `num_data`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, each tuple representing the floating-point numbers read from the standard input, `num_data` is the number of tuples in the `data` list, `num_data` must be equal to the number of times the loop executed; `cross_points` is an empty list**
