`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 2, so after the increment, `count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`cross_points`, `data`, and `(cx, cy)`) are not affected.

Output State: **`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is 3, `data` must contain at least two tuples, `(cx, cy)` is a point such that the Euclidean distance from `(cx, cy)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.**
