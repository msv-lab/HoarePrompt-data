Postcondition: ***`max_overlap` is equal to the maximum value of `count` during the loop execution; `data` must contain at least one tuple; `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple; and the loop executes for each tuple in `data`. If no tuple in `data` satisfies the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS`, then `count` remains 0. Otherwise, `count` is incremented based on the number of tuples that satisfy the condition. Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part remains unchanged.***
