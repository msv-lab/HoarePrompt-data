Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `max_overlap` is equal to 0.
   - `data` must contain at least two tuples.
   - `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `data`.
   - `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `data`.
   - The loop body checks if the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, and if true, it increases `count` by 1.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `data`.
   - The loop will execute again as long as there are more tuples in `data`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since we are moving to the next iteration of the loop, the current tuple `(x, y)` (which is the first element of the second tuple in `data`) will be the first element of the third tuple in `data` for the next iteration.
   - We need to ensure that `data` still contains at least two tuples for the loop to continue.

4. **New State**:
   - `max_overlap` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `data` must now contain at least two tuples (it must still have the third tuple available for the next iteration).
   - `cross_points` remains unchanged.
   - `x` becomes the first element of the third tuple in `data`.
   - `y` becomes the second element of the third tuple in `data`.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`max_overlap` is equal to 0; `data` must contain at least two tuples; `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple; `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `data`; `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `data`.**
