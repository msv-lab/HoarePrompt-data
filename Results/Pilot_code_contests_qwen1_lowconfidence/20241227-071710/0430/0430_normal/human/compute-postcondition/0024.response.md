The code `th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from point `(x1, y1)` to point `(x2, y2)`. However, since `x1` and `y1` are undefined, they are not directly used in the calculation. Instead, the calculation is based on the difference between `x2` and `x1`, and `y2` and `y1`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `data` is a list containing tuples.
- `num_data` must be greater than 0.
- `cross_points` is an empty list.
- `j` is 0.
- `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`.
- `distance` is calculated as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` where `x1` and `y1` are undefined, and the distance is greater than `RADIUS_2`.

Since `x1` and `y1` are undefined, the `math.atan2` function will use the differences `y2 - 0` and `x2 - 0` (assuming `x1` and `y1` are implicitly 0 for the purpose of the calculation), resulting in the angle being the arctangent of `y2` over `x2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `data` is a list containing tuples.
- `num_data` must be greater than 0.
- `cross_points` is an empty list.
- `j` is 0.
- `x2` remains the first element of `data[0]`.
- `y2` remains the second element of `data[0]`.
- `th` is the angle calculated as `math.atan2(y2, x2)`.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2, x2)`**
