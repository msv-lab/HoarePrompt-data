Output State: **`max_overlap` is the maximum value of `count` over all iterations of the loop, `data` must contain at least one tuple, and `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** `data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of all valid calculated intersection points, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `j` is any value from `0` to `num_data - 1` (excluding `i`), `x1` and `y1` are the elements of `data[i]`, `x2` and `y2` are the elements of `data[j]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, and `max_overlap` is `0`.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop iterates over each tuple `(cx, cy)` in `cross_points`.
  - For each `(cx, cy)`, another loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `data`.
  - The condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` checks if the Euclidean distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.
  - The variable `count` keeps track of the number of tuples in `data` that satisfy this condition for each `(cx, cy)`.
  - If `max_overlap` is less than `count`, `max_overlap` is updated to `count`.

- **Final State After All Iterations:**
  - The final value of `max_overlap` is the highest value of `count` encountered during the loop execution.
  - This value is updated only when `count` exceeds the current `max_overlap`.
  - `data` must contain at least one tuple since the loop depends on iterating over `data`.
  - `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple since the loop iterates over `cross_points`.

- **Case When Loop Does Not Execute:**
  - If `cross_points` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `max_overlap` remains `0`.

Thus, the final output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `max_overlap` is the maximum value of `count` over all iterations of the loop, `data` must contain at least one tuple, and `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple.
