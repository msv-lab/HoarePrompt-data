The code snippet appends `cp1` to the `cross_points` list. The value of `cp1` is already defined in the initial state. No other variables are affected by this code.

Therefore, the `cross_points` list now contains `cp1`, and all other variables retain their original values from the initial state.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is a list containing `[cp1]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, the current value of `cp1[0]` is between 0.0 and 10.0 inclusive, and the current value of `cp1[1]` is between 0.0 and 10.0 inclusive.**
