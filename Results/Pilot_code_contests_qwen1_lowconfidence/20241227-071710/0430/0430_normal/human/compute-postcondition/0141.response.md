Now, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `cp1_x` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th + math.acos(sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2))))`.
2. `y1 + math.sin(th - al)` is assigned to `cp2`. However, `al` is defined as `math.acos(distance)`, and `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`. Since `distance` is already computed, we can substitute `al` with `math.acos(distance)`.

Let's denote the values as follows:
- `d = distance` (the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`)
- `cp1_x` is now `x1 + math.cos(th + math.acos(d))`
- `cp2` is now `y1 + math.sin(th - math.acos(distance))`

Since `th` is already defined as `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, we do not need to redefine it. The values of `i`, `j`, `num_data`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `th`, `x2 - x1`, `y2 - y1`, `al`, `cross_points`, and `distance` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `0`, `num_data` is a positive integer, `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `x1` != `x2` or `y1` != `y2`, the distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between these points, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1_x` is `x1 + math.cos(th + math.acos(sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2))))`, `cp2` is `y1 + math.sin(th - math.acos(distance))`.**
