Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `range(num_data)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `num_data` is a positive integer.

2. **Analyze the Variables**:
   - `n`: This variable is given but its value is not relevant to the loop execution since the loop condition depends on `num_data`.
   - `num_data`: This is the number of iterations the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `num_data` must be a positive integer.
   - `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2`: These are constants and do not affect the loop execution.
   - `data`: This is an empty list and will be populated during the loop iterations, but it doesn't affect the loop's initial condition.

3. **Determine the Initial State Needed for Loop Execution**:
   - Since the loop will run based on `num_data`, we need to ensure that `num_data` is a positive integer (i.e., greater than 0).
   - Other variables like `n`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, and `data` are either constants or lists that will be modified within the loop body, and their values at the start do not impact the loop's execution.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment for the loop to execute is to ensure that `num_data` is a positive integer.

**State:**
**`num_data` must be a positive integer**
