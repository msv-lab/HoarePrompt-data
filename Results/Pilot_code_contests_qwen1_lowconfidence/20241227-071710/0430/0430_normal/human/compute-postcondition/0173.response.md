The code calculates `al` using the formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. Here, `distance` is already defined as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, and the values of `x1` and `y1` are not directly accessible in this context but are used to calculate `distance`. The value of `distance` is derived from `x2` and `y2`, which are known.

The impact of the code is that `al` is assigned a new value based on the given formula. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's calculate the value of `al`:

Given:
- `distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`
- `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`

The value of `al` is determined by the formula, but without specific values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, we cannot simplify further. However, we know that `al` is now assigned based on these calculations.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, and `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))**
