The code assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are not specified in the initial state, but they are now stored in `cp1` and `cp2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `x1` and `y1` are stored in `cp1` and `cp2`, `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`**
