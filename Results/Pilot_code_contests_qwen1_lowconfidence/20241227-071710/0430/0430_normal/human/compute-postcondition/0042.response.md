The code calculates `th` using the `math.atan2` function, which computes the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. This affects the value of `th`, but the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`
- `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`
- `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`
- `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if the conditions for `cp2` hold
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`

After executing the code `th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, the value of `th` is updated, but the other variables remain in their initial states or as defined.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + al), y2 + math.sin(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) + al))`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) - al), y1 + math.sin(math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) - al))` if the conditions for `cp2` hold, and `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.**
