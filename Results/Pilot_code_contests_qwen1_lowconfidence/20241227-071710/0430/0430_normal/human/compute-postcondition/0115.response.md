The code snippet calculates the angle `th` using the `math.atan2` function based on the coordinates `x2`, `y2` and `x1`, `y1`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are derived from the elements in `data[num_data]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `num_data` is at least 3.
- `j` is `num_data`.
- `i` is `num_data - 1`.
- `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data][0]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data][1]`.
- `distance` is calculated as `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`.
- `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` and `cp2` appended if certain conditions are met.
- `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions.

The line of code `th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` updates the value of `th` to the angle in radians between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. Since the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are derived from `data[num_data]`, `th` is updated based on these coordinates.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
- `num_data` is at least 3.
- `j` is `num_data`.
- `i` is `num_data - 1`.
- `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data][0]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data][1]`.
- `distance` is calculated as `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`.
- `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` and `cp2` appended if certain conditions are met.
- `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions.
- `th` is updated to the angle in radians between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data][0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` and `cp2` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions, `th` is the angle in radians between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`**.
