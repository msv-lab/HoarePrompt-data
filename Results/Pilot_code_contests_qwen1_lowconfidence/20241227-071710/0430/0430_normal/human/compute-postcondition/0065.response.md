The code `cross_points.append(cp2)` appends `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. Given the initial state, `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if certain conditions are met. Since the condition `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0` was already satisfied (otherwise it would remain unchanged), appending `cp2` to `cross_points` means that `cp2` will now be part of the list. 

The values of all other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`, `cp1` and `cp2` are either `x1, y1` or calculated as \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\) and \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\), `distance` is the Euclidean distance between points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2`.**
