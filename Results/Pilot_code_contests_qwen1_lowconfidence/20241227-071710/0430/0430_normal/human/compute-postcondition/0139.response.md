`al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. The distance `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and it is known that `distance` is less than or equal to the radius squared divided by twice the distance. The value of `al` is calculated based on this distance.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `0`, `num_data` is a positive integer, `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`, the distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between these points, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`**
