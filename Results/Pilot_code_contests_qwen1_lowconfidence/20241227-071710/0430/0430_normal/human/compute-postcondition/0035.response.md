Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` is greater than 0, `cross_points` is a list containing `[cp1]` and possibly `[cp2]` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`. If the conditions `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` do not hold, `cross_points` remains as `[cp1]` and `cp2` is not added to `cross_points`.***
