Postcondition: ***`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `cross_points` remains unchanged. If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both `(x1, y1)`. Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, and `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`***
