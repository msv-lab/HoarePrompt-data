The code calculates the angle `th` using `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`. Given the initial state, `x2` and `y2` are the coordinates of the last element in `data[num_data - 1]`, and `x1` and `y1` are the coordinates of the point immediately preceding `x2` and `y2` in `data[num_data - 1]`. The value of `th` will be the angle between these two points. However, since the exact values of `x1` and `y1` are not specified, we can only express `th` in terms of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, and `cross_points` remains unchanged.**
