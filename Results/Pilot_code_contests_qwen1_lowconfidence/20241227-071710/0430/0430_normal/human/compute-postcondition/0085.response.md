Postcondition: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. If `(x1, y1)` are equal to `(x2, y2)`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both equal to `(x2, y2)`. Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, and `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated as tuples `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` and `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` respectively.**
