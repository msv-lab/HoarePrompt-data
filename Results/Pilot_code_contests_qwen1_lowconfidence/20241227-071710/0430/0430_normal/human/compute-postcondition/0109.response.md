According to the given for loop and the current state, we need to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `num_data` is at least 3.
   - `j` is `num_data - 1`.
   - `i` is `num_data - 1`.
   - `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
   - `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
   - `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
   - `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended if certain conditions are met.
   - `cp2` is appended similarly under certain conditions.
   - `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `num_data - 1`.

3. **Current Value**:
   - `j` is currently `num_data - 1`, which means the last element of `data` has been processed.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from `num_data - 1` to `num_data - 1 + 1 = num_data`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `j` will become `num_data`.
   - Since `i` was set to `num_data - 1` and the loop does not modify `i` directly, `i` remains `num_data - 1`.
   - `x2` and `y2` are derived from `data[num_data - 1]`, so they remain the same.
   - `distance` is recalculated for the new pair `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, but since the problem does not specify any changes to how `distance` is calculated, we assume it remains the same.
   - `cross_points` might change if the conditions for appending `cp1` and `cp2` are met for the new pair `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be `num_data`.
- `x2` and `y2` remain the same as they are derived from `data[num_data - 1]`.
- `distance` remains the same unless there is a specific condition that would change it.
- `cross_points` might change based on the conditions for appending `cp1` and `cp2`.

Since the problem doesn't provide specifics on how `cross_points` would change for the new values of `x2` and `y2`, we'll keep it as `cross_points` with potential modifications.

Final Answer:
State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp2` appended similarly under certain conditions, and `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions.**
