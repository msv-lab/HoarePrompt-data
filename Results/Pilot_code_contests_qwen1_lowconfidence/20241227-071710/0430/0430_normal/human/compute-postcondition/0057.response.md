The code sets both `cp1` and `cp2` to the values of `x1` and `y1`. Since `x1` and `y1` are not specified in the initial state, they remain as they are. The other variables retain their original values and relationships.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds, and `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. All other variables retain their original values and relationships.**
