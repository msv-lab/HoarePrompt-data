According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cross_points`. The loop will iterate over each tuple in `cross_points`. For the loop to execute, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple.

Let's break down the initial states and identify which ones need adjustment:

- `data` is a list containing tuples.
- `num_data` is a positive integer.
- `cross_points` is a list of all valid calculated intersection points.
- `i` is `num_data - 1`.
- `j` is any value from `0` to `num_data - 1` (excluding `i`).
- `x1` and `y1` are the elements of `data[i]`.
- `x2` and `y2` are the elements of `data[j]`.
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
- `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance)`.
- `max_overlap` is `0`.

Since the loop iterates over each tuple in `cross_points`, the critical adjustment needed is ensuring that `cross_points` contains at least one tuple.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple**
