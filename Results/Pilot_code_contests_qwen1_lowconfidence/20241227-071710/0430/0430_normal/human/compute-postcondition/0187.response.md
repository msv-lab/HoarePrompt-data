State before the loop starts: `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is 0

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `data` variable. For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one tuple, because the loop iterates over each tuple in `data`.

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Check the structure of the loop**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `data`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `data` contains at least one tuple.

Given that `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, this means `data` must also contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `data` contains at least one tuple.

State: **`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is 0, `data` must contain at least one tuple**
