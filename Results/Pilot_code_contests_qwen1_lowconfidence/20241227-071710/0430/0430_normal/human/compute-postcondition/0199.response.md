The code assigns the current value of `count` to `max_overlap`. Since `count` represents the number of tuples in `data` for which the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true, and no other operations are performed on the variables, the values of `cross_points`, `count`, `data`, `cx`, `cy`, and `max_overlap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is the number of tuples in `data` for which the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `(cx, cy)` is a point such that the Euclidean distance from `(cx, cy)` to any `(x, y)` in `data` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, and `max_overlap` is now equal to `count`.**
