The code initializes two variables `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` with the values `1 + 1e-12` and `2 + 1e-12`, respectively. These values do not depend on any other variables and are constants. The initial values of `n`, `xi`, and `yi` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated constant values for `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2`, and retains the original values of `n`, `xi`, and `yi`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `xi` and `yi` are real numbers given as a string in the format "a,b" where 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10, representing the coordinates of the i-th sticker; `RADIUS` is 1 + 1e-12; `RADIUS_2` is 2 + 1e-12.**
