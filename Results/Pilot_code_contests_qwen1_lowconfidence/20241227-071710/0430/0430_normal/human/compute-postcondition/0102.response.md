The code updates the value of `cp2` using the formula `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`. Given that `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` and `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, these values remain unchanged. The other variables are not affected.

Let's break it down:

- `cp1` is defined as `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.
- `cp2` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`.

So, the new value of `cp2` is calculated using the updated formula. The other variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `cross_points` remains unchanged, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, `cp2` is `x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)`**
