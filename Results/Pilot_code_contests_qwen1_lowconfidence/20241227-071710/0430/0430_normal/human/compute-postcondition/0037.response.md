The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific changes are made to any variables when using `continue`, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if the conditions for `cp2` hold.**
