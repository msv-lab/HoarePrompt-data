Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration. If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, then `cross_points` includes `[x2, y2]`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged.***
