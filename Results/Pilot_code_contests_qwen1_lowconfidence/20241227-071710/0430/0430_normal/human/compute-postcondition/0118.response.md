The code assigns `cp2` with the value `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`. We know that `x1` and `y1` are derived from `x2` and `y2`, and the values of `th` and `al` are also known.

From the initial state:
- `th` is the angle in radians between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, where `distance` is calculated as `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`.

Given these, we can directly substitute the expressions into the new assignment for `cp2`.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data][0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` and `cp2` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `th` is the angle in radians between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - math.acos(distance)), y1 + math.sin(th - math.acos(distance)))**
