The code updates the values of `x2` and `y2` to be the first and second elements of `data[j]`, respectively. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `x2` and `y2` are updated to be the first and second elements of `data[1]`.

- The initial value of `x2` was the first element of `data[1]`.
- The initial value of `y2` was the second element of `data[1]`.

After executing the code, these values are directly taken from `data[j]`, which is `data[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if the conditions for `cp2` hold.**
