`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `max_overlap`, `data`, `cross_points`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The value of `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y)` is still less than or equal to `RADIUS`.

Output State: **`max_overlap` is equal to 0, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `data`, `y` is the second element of the first tuple in `data`, and `count` is increased by 1.**
