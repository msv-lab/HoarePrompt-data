Postcondition: **`max_overlap` is equal to 0, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `data`, `y` is the second element of the first tuple in `data`. The current value of `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.**
