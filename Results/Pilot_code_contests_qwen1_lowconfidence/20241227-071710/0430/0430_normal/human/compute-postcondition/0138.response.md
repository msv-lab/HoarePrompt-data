The code calculates the angle `th` using the `math.atan2` function with the differences in the y and x coordinates between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`. This function returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.

The initial values of the variables are as follows:
- `i` is `num_data - 2`
- `j` is `0`
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`
- `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`
- `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`
- `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`
- `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`
- The distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between these points
- `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration

After executing the line of code:
```python
th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)
```
- `th` is assigned the value returned by `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `0`, `num_data` is a positive integer, `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`, the distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between these points, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration**.
