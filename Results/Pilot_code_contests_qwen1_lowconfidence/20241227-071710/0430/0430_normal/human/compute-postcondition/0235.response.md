The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes the coordinates of stickers on a square origami paper with a side length of 10. Each sticker's center is defined by a pair of coordinates (xi, yi) given as strings in the format "a,b", where 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10. The function checks if all stickers are within the bounds of the origami paper.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the coordinates of stickers and determine if they are within the bounds of a 10x10 origami paper.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, processes the coordinates of stickers within a 10x10 origami paper, and returns whether all stickers are within the paper bounds.**
