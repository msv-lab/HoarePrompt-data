Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`, `cp1` and `cp2` are either `x1, y1` or calculated as \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\) and \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\), `distance` is the Euclidean distance between points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `cross_points` is a list containing `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their original values and relationships.***
