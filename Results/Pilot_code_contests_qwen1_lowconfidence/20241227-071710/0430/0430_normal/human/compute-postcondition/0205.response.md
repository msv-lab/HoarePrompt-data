`count` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `count` is 0, so after executing `count += 1`, the value of `count` becomes 1. The distances and tuples mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` must contain at least one tuple, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is 1, `max_overlap` remains unchanged, and the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.**
