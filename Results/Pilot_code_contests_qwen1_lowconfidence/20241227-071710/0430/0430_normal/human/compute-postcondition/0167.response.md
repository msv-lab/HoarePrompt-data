The `continue` statement in the code causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not have an effect, and the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration.**
