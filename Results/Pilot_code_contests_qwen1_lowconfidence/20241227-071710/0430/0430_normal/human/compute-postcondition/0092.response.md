Postcondition: ***`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, and `cross_points` contains either `[cp1]` or `[cp1, cp2]` where `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, and optionally `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`.***
