Postcondition: ***`max_overlap` is equal to `count`, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is the number of tuples in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, and `max_overlap` remains unchanged because it is now equal to `count`.***
