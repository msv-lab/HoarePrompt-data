The code assigns `x2` and `y2` the values from `data[j]`. Given that `j` is `1`, `x2` and `y2` will take the values from `data[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`**
