Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `num_data` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is `num_data - 1`.
   - `i` is `num_data - 1`.
   - `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
   - `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
   - `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
   - `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of `num_data`. Therefore, the loop condition depends on the value of `i`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `num_data - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and become `0` (the start of the next iteration).
   - Since `i` starts from `num_data - 1` and goes down to `0`, after the current iteration, `i` becomes `num_data - 2`.

4. **Adjust Other States**:
   - `j` remains the same as it was not affected by the loop.
   - `x2` and `y2` remain the same as they were taken from `data[num_data - 1]`, and since `num_data` hasn't changed, these values won't change.
   - `distance` remains the same as it was calculated from `data[num_data - 1]`.
   - `cross_points` remains the same as it was built up from previous iterations and hasn't been altered by the loop.

5. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - `i` should now be `num_data - 2`.
   - All other states (`num_data`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, and `cross_points`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `num_data` is a positive integer, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration**.
