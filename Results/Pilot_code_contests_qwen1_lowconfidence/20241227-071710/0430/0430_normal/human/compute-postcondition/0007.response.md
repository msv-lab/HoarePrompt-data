The code `data.append(tuple(float(s) for s in stdin.readline().split(',')))` appends a new tuple containing floating-point numbers to the list `data`. The tuple is created by splitting the string read from standard input (`stdin.readline()`) using commas as delimiters and converting each resulting string to a float.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is `('float(s1)', 'float(s2)', ...)`
- `num_data` must be greater than 1

Let's assume the standard input reads a string like `"1.5,2.3"`. This string is split into two parts: "1.5" and "2.3", which are then converted to floats: `1.5` and `2.3`.

Therefore, the new tuple is `(1.5, 2.3)`.

After appending this tuple to `data`, the updated `data` will be:
- Original content: `('float(s1)', 'float(s2)', ...)`
- New content: `(1.5, 2.3)`

The variable `num_data` remains unchanged as the code does not directly affect it.

Output State: **`data` is `('float(s1)', 'float(s2)', ..., 1.5, 2.3); `num_data` must be greater than 1**
