According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `data`. For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one tuple. The initial state given mentions that `data` must contain at least one tuple, but it also mentions that `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, which is not directly relevant to the loop's execution based on the provided code.

Given the information, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `data` contains at least one tuple.

State: **`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is 0, `max_overlap` remains unchanged** (though the latter two do not affect the loop's ability to execute, they are included as per the given state). 

Since `data` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute, the critical adjustment is focusing on `data`.

State: **`data` must contain at least one tuple, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is 0, `max_overlap` remains unchanged**.
