The code `x1, y1 = data[i]` assigns the first and second elements of the tuple at index `i` in the list `data` to the variables `x1` and `y1`, respectively. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified. Therefore, the value of `i` could be any valid index for the list `data`. The variables `data`, `num_data`, and `cross_points` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `x1` is the first element of `data[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `data[i]`**
