The code assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Since the values of `x1` and `y1` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, they remain as they are. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`, and `cross_points` remains unchanged.**
