Postcondition: ***`max_overlap` is equal to 0, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is the first element of the first tuple in `data`, `y` is the second element of the first tuple in `data`, and if the distance from `(cx, cy)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
