The code assigns the values of `x1` and `y1` to `cp1` and `cp2`. Since `x1` and `y1` are initially equal to `x2` and `y2`, respectively, `cp1` and `cp2` will both be assigned the tuple `(x2, y2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `cp1` is (x2, y2), `cp2` is (x2, y2), the distance is calculated as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` where `x1` and `y1` are undefined, the distance is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`**
