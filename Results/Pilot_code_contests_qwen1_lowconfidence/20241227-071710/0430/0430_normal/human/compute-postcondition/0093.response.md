Let's break down the given state and the for loop to understand what needs to change for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num_data` is at least 3.
- `j` is `num_data - 2`.
- `i` is equal to `j`.
- `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`.
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
- `cross_points` contains either `[cp1]` or `[cp1, cp2]` where `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, and optionally `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = num_data - 1`.
2. **Current State of `j`**: `j` is currently set to `num_data - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `num_data - 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since `j` is currently `num_data - 2`, after incrementing, `j` will be `num_data - 1`.
- `i` will be updated to match `j`, so `i` will also be `num_data - 1`.
- `x2` and `y2` will now refer to the elements of `data[num_data - 1]`.
- `distance` will be recalculated based on the new values of `x2` and `y2`.
- `cross_points` will likely be recalculated based on the new point.

### Updated State:
- `num_data` remains at least 3.
- `j` is updated to `num_data - 1`.
- `i` is updated to `num_data - 1`.
- `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
- `distance` is updated to `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
- `cross_points` is updated based on the new point.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, and `cross_points` contains either `[cp1]` or `[cp1, cp2]` where `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, and optionally `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`.**
