Postcondition: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` is greater than 0, `cross_points` is a list containing `[cp1]` if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, otherwise `cross_points` remains an empty list, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, and the current value of `cp2` satisfies `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`**
