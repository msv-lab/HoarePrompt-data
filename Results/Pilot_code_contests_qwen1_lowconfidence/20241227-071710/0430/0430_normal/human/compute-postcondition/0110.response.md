The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop context is provided in the code snippet, the behavior of `continue` is not directly applicable. However, given the context and the absence of any loop, the code does not modify any of the existing variables and simply skips to the next line of code outside the loop.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp2` is appended similarly under certain conditions, and `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions.**
