The code updates the variable `cp1` to be a tuple with the x-coordinate `x1 + math.cos(th + al)` and the y-coordinate `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `num_data` is at least 3.
- `j` is `num_data - 1`.
- `i` is `num_data - 1`.
- `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
- `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `cross_points` remains unchanged.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance`.
- `cp1` is updated to `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `cross_points` remains unchanged, `al` is `math.acos(distance`, `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`**.
