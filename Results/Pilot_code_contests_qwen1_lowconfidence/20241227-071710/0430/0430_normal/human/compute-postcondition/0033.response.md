The code appends `cp2` to the `cross_points` list. Given the precondition, `cp2` is already within the specified range, so it will be added to `cross_points`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` is greater than 0, `cross_points` is a list containing `[cp1]` and `[cp2]`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`**
