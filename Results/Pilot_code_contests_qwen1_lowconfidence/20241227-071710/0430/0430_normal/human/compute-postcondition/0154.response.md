The code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x1` and `y1`. Since these values are not provided, they remain unchanged. The code updates the variable `distance` with the calculated distance.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`**
