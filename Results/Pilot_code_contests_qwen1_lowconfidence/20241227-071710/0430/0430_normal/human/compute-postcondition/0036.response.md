According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `num_data`. If `j` is less than `num_data`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, the following states were true:
- `data` is a list containing tuples,
- `num_data` is greater than 0,
- `cross_points` is a list containing `[cp1]` and possibly `[cp2]` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`,
- `j` is 0,
- `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`,
- `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`,
- `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`,
- `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `1`. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `num_data`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `j` should be 1,
- `x2` should be the first element of `data[1]` (if `j` was incremented to 1),
- `y2` should be the second element of `data[1]` (if `j` was incremented to 1),
- `cp1` should be recalculated based on the new `x2` and `y2` (if `j` was incremented to 1),
- `cp2` should be recalculated based on the new `x2` and `y2` (if `j` was incremented to 1),
- `cross_points` should either remain as `[cp1]` or be updated to `[cp1, cp2]` if both conditions for `cp2` hold.

However, since we do not know the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`, and we only know that `j` needs to be incremented, the core adjustment is:

State: **`j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` if the conditions for `cp2` hold.**
