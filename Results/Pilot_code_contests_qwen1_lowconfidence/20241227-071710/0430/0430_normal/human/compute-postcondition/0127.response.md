`x1` and `y1` are assigned the values of `data[i][0]` and `data[i][1]` respectively. Given the initial state, `i` is `num_data - 2`, so `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]` and `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`. The values of `num_data`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, and `cross_points` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`; `num_data` is a positive integer; `j` is `num_data - 1`; `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`; `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`; `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`; `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`; and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration.**
