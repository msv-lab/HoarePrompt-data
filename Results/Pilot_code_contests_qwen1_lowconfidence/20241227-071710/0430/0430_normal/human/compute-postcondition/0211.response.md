`count` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `count` will be its original value plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` must contain at least two tuples, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is either 2 or 3 depending on the original value, `max_overlap` remains unchanged.**
