Let's go through the given Python code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `num_data` is at least 3.
   - `j` is `num_data - 2`.
   - `i` is equal to `j`.
   - `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`.
   - `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`.
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
   - `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
   - `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `cp1 = x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)` updates the value of `cp1`. This creates a tuple where:
     - The first element is `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`.
     - The second element is `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `cp1` is now defined as a tuple containing two new values derived from `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al`.

4. **Output State:**
   - The values of `num_data`, `j`, `i`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, and `al` remain unchanged.
   - `cp1` is a tuple containing `x1 + math.cos(th + al)` and `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables after executing the code is as follows:
- `num_data` is at least 3.
- `j` is `num_data - 2`.
- `i` is equal to `j`.
- `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`.
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
- `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.
- `cp1` is a tuple `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is a tuple `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))**.
