The code assigns `x1, y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Given that `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, and initially `x1` and `y1` are the same as `x2` and `y2` respectively, `cp1` and `cp2` are both set to `x1, y1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `0`, `num_data` is a positive integer, `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`, the distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between these points, and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration. Additionally, `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`.**
