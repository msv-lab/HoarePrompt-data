Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration. If `cp2[0]` and `cp2[1]` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], `cp2` is appended to `cross_points`; otherwise, `cp2` remains unchanged. `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`. If `cp2` is within the specified range, it is added to `cross_points`. Otherwise, it is not modified.***
