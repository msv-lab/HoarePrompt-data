Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` is a positive integer, `cross_points` is a list of points that meet the conditions, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data-1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data-1]`, `cp1` and `cp2` are either `x1, y1` or calculated as \((x1 + \cos(\theta + \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta + \alpha))\) and \((x1 + \cos(\theta - \alpha), y1 + \sin(\theta - \alpha))\) depending on the conditions, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds. `cross_points` contains all valid calculated points from each iteration where the conditions `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0` hold. If the loop does not execute, `cross_points` remains an empty list.**
