The `continue` statement in this context simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. The condition `i == j` remains true since the `continue` statement does not alter `i` or `j`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `0`, `num_data` is a positive integer, `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration. The condition `i == j` is still true.**
