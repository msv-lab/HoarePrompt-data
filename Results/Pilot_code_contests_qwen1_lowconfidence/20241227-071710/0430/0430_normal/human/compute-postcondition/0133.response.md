The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` using the formula `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. This updates the value of the variable `distance`.

- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged because they are not used in the calculation.
- The values of `num_data`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
- The variable `cross_points` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the calculation.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:
- `i` is `num_data - 2`
- `j` is `0`
- `num_data` is a positive integer
- `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`
- `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`
- `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`
- `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`
- `distance` is now the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`
- `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `0`, `num_data` is a positive integer, `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration.**
