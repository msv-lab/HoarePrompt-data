Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop is defined by `for j in range(num_data)`, which means it will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = num_data - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`.
   - `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`.
   - `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.
   - `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.
   - `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`.
   - `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds.
   - `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `num_data`.
   - Currently, `j` is 1, so for the next iteration, `j` should be 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - `x2` will now be the first element of `data[2]`.
   - `y2` will now be the second element of `data[2]`.
   - `cp1` and `cp2` will depend on the new values of `x2` and `y2`, but their exact values are not specified here. They remain consistent with the conditions given.
   - `distance` will be recalculated based on the new `x2` and `y2`.
   - `al` will be recalculated if the distance condition holds.
   - `cross_points` will be recalculated if both `cp2` coordinates are within the specified range.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`, `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds, and `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. All other variables retain their original values and relationships as per the precondition.**
