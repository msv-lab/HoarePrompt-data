The code assigns `data[j]` to the tuple variables `x2` and `y2`. Given that `j` is equal to `num_data - 2` and `i` is equal to `j`, the value of `j` is `num_data - 2`. Therefore, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values from `data[num_data - 2]`.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`**
