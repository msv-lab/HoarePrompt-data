The code appends `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. Since `cp1` is already defined and its values satisfy the condition `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, appending it to `cross_points` does not change its values but adds it to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are tuples where `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, `cross_points` is a list containing `[cp1]`**
