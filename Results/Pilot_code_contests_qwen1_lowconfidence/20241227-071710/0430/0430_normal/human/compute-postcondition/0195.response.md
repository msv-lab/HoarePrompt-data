The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is either 3 or 2, so after incrementing, it will be 4 if it was 3, or 3 if it was 2. The states of the other variables (`cross_points` and `data`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is either 4 (if initially 3) or 3 (if initially 2), `data` must contain at least one tuple.

Output State: **`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is either 4 (if initially 3) or 3 (if initially 2), `data` must contain at least one tuple**
