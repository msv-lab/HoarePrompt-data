The code updates the value of `cp1` to `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the value of `cp1` is now updated, and the rest of the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of `data[2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[2]`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance`**
