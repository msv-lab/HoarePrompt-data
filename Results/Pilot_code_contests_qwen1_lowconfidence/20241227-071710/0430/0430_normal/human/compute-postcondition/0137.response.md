Postcondition: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `0`, `num_data` is a positive integer, `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, the distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between these points, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, and either `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`**
