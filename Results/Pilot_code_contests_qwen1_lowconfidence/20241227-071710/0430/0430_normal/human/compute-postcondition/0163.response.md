The code snippet appends `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. Let's analyze the impact on the program:

1. `cross_points.append(cp2)` appends the value of `cp2` to the list `cross_points`.
2. The value of `cp2` depends on the conditions in the previous code (which are not shown here), but it is either `(x1 + \cos(\text{th} + \text{al}), y1 + \sin(\text{th} + \text{al}))` if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, or `(x1 + \cos(\text{th} - \text{al}), y1 + \sin(\text{th} - \text{al}))` otherwise.

Since the exact value of `cp2` is not specified, we will represent it in terms of the given expressions. However, the fact that `cp2` is appended to `cross_points` means that `cross_points` now contains one additional element, which is `cp2`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration plus the new point `cp2`, `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`.**
