Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, each tuple representing the floating-point numbers read from the standard input, `num_data` is the number of tuples in the `data` list, `num_data` must be equal to the number of times the loop executed.** 

Explanation:
- The loop appends tuples of floating-point numbers to the `data` list. Each tuple is created from the input read from the standard input using `stdin.readline().split(',')`.
- After the loop completes its execution, the number of tuples in the `data` list will be equal to the value of `num_data`, which was provided as input at the beginning of the program.
- If the loop does not execute at all, `data` will remain an empty list, and `num_data` will retain its initial value, which is read from standard input.
- The loop ensures that each iteration adds exactly one tuple to the `data` list, thus the final length of `data` will match the value of `num_data`.
