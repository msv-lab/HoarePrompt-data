The code assigns `x1, y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Given the initial state, `x1` and `y1` are not explicitly defined, but they are assumed to be specific values based on the conditions mentioned in the initial state. Since the code does not provide explicit values for `x1` and `y1`, we will keep them as `x1` and `y1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data]`, `distance` is math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1]), `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp2` is appended similarly under certain conditions, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`.**
