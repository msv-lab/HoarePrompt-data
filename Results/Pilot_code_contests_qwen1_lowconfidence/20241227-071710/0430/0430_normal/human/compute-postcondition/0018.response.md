The code assigns the values from the tuple in the list `data` at index `j` to `x2` and `y2`. The values of `x2` and `y2` are taken from the tuple located at `data[j]`. The values of `data`, `num_data`, `cross_points`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is updated to be the current value of `j` (which is 0), but since no new value is assigned to `j`, its value remains 0.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`.**
