The code calculates the angle `th` using the `math.atan2` function, which takes the differences in y and x coordinates as arguments. Specifically, it calculates the angle between the line segment from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) and the positive x-axis. The variables `x1` and `y1` are not provided directly but can be inferred from the context.

- `y2 - y1` is the difference in y-coordinates.
- `x2 - x1` is the difference in x-coordinates.

The variables `i`, `j`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`, and `distance` are not directly affected by this line of code. The `math.atan2` function does not modify these variables; instead, it assigns a new value to `th`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`**.
