The code calculates `al` using the formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `distance`, so we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `al`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, and `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1); al` is calculated as `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`**.
