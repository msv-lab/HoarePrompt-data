The code snippet `data.append(tuple(float(s) for s in stdin.readline().split(',')))` reads a line from standard input, splits it by commas, converts each substring to a float, and appends the resulting tuple to the list `data`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `data` or any other variables, we will consider the impact on `data`.

Let's assume that before the execution of the code, `data` is an empty list (`[]`). After executing the code, `data` will contain one tuple of floats.

Output State: **`data` is [('float(s1)', 'float(s2)', ...)]**, where `s1`, `s2`, etc., are the substrings read from standard input and converted to floats.
