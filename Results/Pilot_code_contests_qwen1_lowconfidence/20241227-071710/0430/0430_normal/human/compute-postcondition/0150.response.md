Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is `num_data - 2`
   - `j` is `0`
   - `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration.

2. **Understand the for loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(num_data):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `num_data - 1`.

4. **Analyze the given states:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `0`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range of `range(num_data)`.

5. **Calculate the new state:**
   - Since `j` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing `j` by 1, `j` will be `1`.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `i`.

6. **Update the `cross_points` list:**
   - The `cross_points` list is updated based on the loop body, but we don't have the details of the loop body. Therefore, we assume that `cross_points` might have been modified during the execution of the loop body, but we don't know exactly how it changes.

7. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `i` remains `num_data - 2`.
   - `j` becomes `1`.
   - `cross_points` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body modifies it.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration.**
