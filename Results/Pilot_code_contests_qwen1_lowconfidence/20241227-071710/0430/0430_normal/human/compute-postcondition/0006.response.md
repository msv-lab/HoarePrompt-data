According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_data`. The loop runs `num_data` times, and each time `num_data` is decremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `data` is `('float(s1)', 'float(s2)', ...)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_data` must be greater than 0 because the loop runs `num_data` times and starts from `num_data` down to 0.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `num_data` should be decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0.

State: **`data` is `('float(s1)', 'float(s2)', ...)` and `num_data` must be greater than 1**
