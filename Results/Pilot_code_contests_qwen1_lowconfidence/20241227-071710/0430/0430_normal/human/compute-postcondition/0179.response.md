The code `cross_points.append(cp2)` appends the value of `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. Since `cp2` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `cross_points` will include this new value.

The other variables (`i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration including the new point `cp2`.**
