The code creates a new point `cp1` using the formula for rotating a point around another point. Specifically, `cp1` is created by rotating the point `(x1, y1)` by an angle `th + al` around itself. Given that `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` and `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, we can update the variables accordingly.

- `cp1` is defined as `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.
- The values of `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `cross_points`, `distance`, and `th` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, and `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`**.
