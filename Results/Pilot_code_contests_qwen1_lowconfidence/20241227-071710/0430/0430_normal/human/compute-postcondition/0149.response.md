Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `0`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration. If the Euclidean distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, the point `cp2` is appended to `cross_points`.***
