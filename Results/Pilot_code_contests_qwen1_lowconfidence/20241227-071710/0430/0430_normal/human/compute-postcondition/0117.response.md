The code updates the value of `cp1` based on the formula `cp1 = (x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`. This means that `cp1` is now updated to this new value, while other variables remain unchanged.

Here's the detailed output state:

- `num_data` is at least 3.
- `j` is `num_data`.
- `i` is `num_data - 1`.
- `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data][0]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data][1]`.
- `distance` is `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`.
- `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` and `cp2` appended if certain conditions are met.
- `cp1` is updated to `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.
- `th` is the angle in radians between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
- `al` is `math.acos(distance`.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data][0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` and `cp2` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `th` is the angle in radians between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance`**
