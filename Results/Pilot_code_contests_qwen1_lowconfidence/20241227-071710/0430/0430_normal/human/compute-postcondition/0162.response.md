Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration. If `cp1[0]` and `cp1[1]` are within the range [0.0, 10.0], `cp1` is appended to `cross_points`; otherwise, `cp1` remains unchanged. `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, and `cp2` is either assigned the value of `(x1 + \cos(\text{th} + \text{al}), y1 + \sin(\text{th} + \text{al}))` (if `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`) or `(x1 + \cos(\text{th} - \text{al}), y1 + \sin(\text{th} - \text{al}))` (otherwise).***
