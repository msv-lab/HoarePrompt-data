`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `max_overlap`, `data`, `cross_points`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_overlap` is equal to 0; `data` must contain at least two tuples; `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple; `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `data`; `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `data`; `count` is increased by 1.
