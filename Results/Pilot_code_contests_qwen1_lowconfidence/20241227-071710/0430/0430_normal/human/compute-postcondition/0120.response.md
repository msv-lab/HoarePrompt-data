The code appends `cp1` to the `cross_points` list. Since `cp1` is defined as either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on certain conditions, and `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and `al` are derived from `x2` and `y2`, the only change is that `cp1` is added to `cross_points`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data][0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended.**
