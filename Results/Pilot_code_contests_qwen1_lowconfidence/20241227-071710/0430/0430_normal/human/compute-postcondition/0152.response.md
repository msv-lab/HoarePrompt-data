Postcondition: ***`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration. Since the if condition `i == j` is false (as `i` is `num_data - 2` and `j` is `1`), the else part does not execute, and the overall state remains as specified in the if part.***
