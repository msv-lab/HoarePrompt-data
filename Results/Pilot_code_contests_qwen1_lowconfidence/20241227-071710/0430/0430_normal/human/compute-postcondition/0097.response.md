The code `distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` calculates the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` and assigns it to the variable `distance`. However, the values of `x1` and `y1` are not provided in the initial state, so they remain unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, and `cross_points` remains unchanged.**
