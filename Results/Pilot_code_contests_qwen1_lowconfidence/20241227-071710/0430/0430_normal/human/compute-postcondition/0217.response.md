According to the given code, the loop iterates over each tuple `(cx, cy)` in `cross_points`. The loop will continue as long as there are tuples left in `cross_points`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `max_overlap` is equal to `count`.
- `data` must contain at least one tuple.
- `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple.
- `count` is the number of tuples in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.
- `max_overlap` remains unchanged because it is now equal to `count`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must still be at least one tuple in `cross_points`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`max_overlap` is equal to `count`, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is the number of tuples in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, and `max_overlap` remains unchanged because it is now equal to `count`.**

Since the loop will continue as long as `cross_points` contains at least one tuple, the only adjustment needed is to indicate that `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple for the next iteration.

State: **`max_overlap` is equal to `count`, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is the number of tuples in `data` for which the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, and `max_overlap` remains unchanged because it is now equal to `count`.**
