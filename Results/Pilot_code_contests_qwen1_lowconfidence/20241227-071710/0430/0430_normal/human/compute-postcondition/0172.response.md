`th` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`. This function calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`. However, since the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not explicitly given, we can express `th` in terms of these coordinates. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, and `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.**
