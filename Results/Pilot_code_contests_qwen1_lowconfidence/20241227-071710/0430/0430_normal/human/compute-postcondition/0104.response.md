The code `cross_points.append(cp1)` appends the value of `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. From the initial state, we know the values of `cp1` based on the conditions given.

Let's summarize the initial conditions and the value of `cp1`:
- `num_data` is at least 3.
- `j` is `num_data - 1`.
- `i` is `num_data - 1`.
- `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
- `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`.
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
- If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both `(x1, y1)`.
- Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, and `cp1` is `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.

Since the code does not provide the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, or `distance`, we will keep the expression for `cp1` as given:

- If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, then `cp1 = (x1, y1)`.
- Otherwise, `cp1 = (x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.

The list `cross_points` is updated by appending `cp1` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended, and `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions.
