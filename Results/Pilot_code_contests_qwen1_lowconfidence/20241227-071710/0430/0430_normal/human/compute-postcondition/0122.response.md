`cross_points.append(cp2)` appends the value of `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `cp2`, we only know that `cp2` is being added to `cross_points`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the second element of `data[num_data][0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data][1]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(data[num_data][1] - data[num_data][0], data[num_data][2] - data[num_data][1])`, `cross_points` is the original list plus the value of `cp2`.**
