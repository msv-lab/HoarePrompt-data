The code calculates `al` using the formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. However, the value of `distance` is not provided in the initial state. We know that `distance` is a variable that needs to be defined before this line of code. Since no specific value for `distance` is given, `al` will be a function of `distance`.

The states of other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2, x2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))**
