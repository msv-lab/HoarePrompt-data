Postcondition: **`max_overlap` is equal to 0; `data` must contain at least two tuples; `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple; `x` is the first element of the second tuple in `data`; `y` is the second element of the second tuple in `data`; if the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, then `count` is increased by 1.**
