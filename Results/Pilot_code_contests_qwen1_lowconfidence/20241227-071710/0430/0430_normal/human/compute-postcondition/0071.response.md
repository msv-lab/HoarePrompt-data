Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - `j`: This variable is initialized to `num_data - 2` and will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `num_data`.
   - The loop will run for each value of `j` from `num_data - 2` to `num_data - 1`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `data`: A list containing tuples.
   - `num_data`: A positive integer representing the length of the `data` list.
   - `cross_points`: A list of points that meet specific conditions.
   - `j` is set to `num_data - 2`.
   - `x2` and `y2` are the coordinates of `data[num_data-2]`.
   - `x1` and `y1` will be the coordinates of `data[j]` (which will change in each iteration).
   - `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on certain conditions involving `x1`, `y1`, and angles.
   - `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
   - `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `j < num_data`.
   - Initially, `j` is `num_data - 2`, and it will run until `j` is `num_data - 1`.

4. **Conditions for `cross_points`:**
   - For each iteration, `cp1` and `cp2` must be within the bounds `[0.0, 10.0]` for both coordinates.
   - If these conditions are met, the points are added to `cross_points`.

5. **Initial Values Needed for Execution:**
   - Since `j` starts at `num_data - 2`, the values of `data[num_data-2]` are already known.
   - `num_data` must be at least 3 for the loop to run at least once (since `j` goes up to `num_data - 1`).
   - The initial values of `x2`, `y2`, `x1`, `y1`, `cp1`, `cp2`, `distance`, and `al` are derived from the `data` list and calculations based on the angles, but we don't need to adjust them for the loop to start executing.
   - `cross_points` should be an empty list initially since no points have been added yet.

### Adjusted States:

- `num_data` must be at least 3.
- `j` must be initialized to `num_data - 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`**.
