The code `distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)` calculates the Euclidean distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. However, the values of `x1` and `y1` are not provided in the initial state, only `x2` and `y2` are defined. The values of `i`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, and `cross_points` will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

Since `x1` and `y1` are not defined, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `distance`. But we can express `distance` in terms of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, `x2` is the x-coordinate from `data[2]`, `y2` is the y-coordinate from `data[2]`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, and `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.**
