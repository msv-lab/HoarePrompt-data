Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `cp1` and `cp2` are either both `(x2, y2)` if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, otherwise `th` is `math.atan2(y2, x2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`. Additionally, the current value of `cp1[0]` is between 0.0 and 10.0 inclusive, and the current value of `cp1[1]` is between 0.0 and 10.0 inclusive.***
