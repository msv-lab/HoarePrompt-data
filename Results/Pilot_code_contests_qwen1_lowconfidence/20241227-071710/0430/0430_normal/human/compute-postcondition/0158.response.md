The code assigns a new value to `cp1`, which is calculated using the formulas involving trigonometric functions and the previously defined variables. Specifically, `cp1` is updated to be:

\[ cp1 = (x1 + \cos(\text{th} + \text{al}), y1 + \sin(\text{th} + \text{al})) \]

Given that `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)` and `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, the values of `x1` and `y1` remain unchanged, while `cp1` is now a tuple with updated coordinates.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `x2` is `data[1][0]`, `y2` is `data[1][1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1` is `(x1 + \cos(\text{th} + \text{al}), y1 + \sin(\text{th} + \text{al}))`**
