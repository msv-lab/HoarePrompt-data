Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, `cp1` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is either `x1, y1` or `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)` if the distance condition holds, and `cross_points` is a list with two elements `cp1` and `cp2` if `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`. All other variables retain their original values and relationships as per the precondition.***

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if statement directly serves as the overall postcondition of the if-else block. It includes all the possible conditions and the resulting states of the variables after the execution of the if statement.
