According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_data`. The loop will execute as long as `num_data` is at least 1. Here's the reasoning:

1. The loop iterates from `0` to `num_data - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `num_data` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `data` being a list of tuples and `cross_points` being an empty list does not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but they should be included in the state for completeness.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are that `num_data` must be greater than 0.

State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list**
