The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `cross_points`. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if there was one) and continues to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `cross_points` remains the same list.

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `1`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration.**
