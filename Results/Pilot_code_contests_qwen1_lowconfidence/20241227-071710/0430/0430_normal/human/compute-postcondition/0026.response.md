`cp1` is assigned the value `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`. The values of `x1` and `y1` are not directly mentioned in the initial state but are derived from the first tuple in `data`, which means `x1` is `x2` and `y1` is `y2`. The other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `x1` is `x2`
- `y1` is `y2`
- `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))`

The output state is:

Output State: **`data` is a list containing tuples, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `cross_points` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2, x2)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance`, `cp1` is `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))**
