The code `cp1 = x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)` calculates a new point `cp1` based on the trigonometric functions `cos` and `sin`. Let's break down the steps:

1. `th` is already defined as `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
2. `al` is defined as `math.acos(distance)`, but `distance` is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet. However, we know that `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, which is calculated as `sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)`.
3. `cp1` is updated to be `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`.

Since `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, and `distance` is `sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)`, we substitute these into the equations:

- `cp1_x = x1 + math.cos(th + math.acos(sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)))`
- `cp1_y = y1 + math.sin(th + math.acos(sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)))`

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `0`, `num_data` is a positive integer, `x1` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y1` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `x2` is the first element of `data[0]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[0]`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `x1 != x2` or `y1 != y2`, the distance between the points `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between these points, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration, `al` is `math.acos(distance)`, `cp1_x` is `x1 + math.cos(th + math.acos(sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)))`, `cp1_y` is `y1 + math.sin(th + math.acos(sqrt((x2 - y1)**2 + (x2 - x1)**2)))**.
