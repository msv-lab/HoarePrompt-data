Postcondition: ***`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended if certain conditions are met, `cp2` is appended similarly under certain conditions, and `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions. Since the if condition `i == j` is always true given the preconditions, `cp1` is guaranteed to be appended to `cross_points`.***
