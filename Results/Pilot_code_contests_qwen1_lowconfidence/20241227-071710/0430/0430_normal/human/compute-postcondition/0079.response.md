The code `cp1 = cp2 = x1, y1` assigns the tuple `(x1, y1)` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Since the initial state specifies that `(x1, y1)` are equal to `(x2, y2)`, it follows that `cp1` and `cp2` will also be assigned the tuple `(x2, y2)`. 

Therefore, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, and the new variables `cp1` and `cp2` are created and assigned the same tuple.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` is `(x2, y2)`, `cp2` is `(x2, y2)`, and `(x1, y1)` are equal to `(x2, y2)`**
