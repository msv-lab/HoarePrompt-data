The code `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` calculates the value of `al` using the formula involving `distance`. The previous value of `distance` is given as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, which means `distance` is the Euclidean distance between points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

Let's substitute `distance` in the equation:

\[ al = \mathbf{math.acos}\left(\left(math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)\right)^2 / (2.0 \times math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1))\right) \]

Since `distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, let's denote this distance as `d`. Thus,

\[ al = \mathbf{math.acos}\left(d^2 / (2.0 \times d)\right) \]
\[ al = \mathbf{math.acos}\left(d / 2.0\right) \]

This value is now assigned to `al`.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, and `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`**
