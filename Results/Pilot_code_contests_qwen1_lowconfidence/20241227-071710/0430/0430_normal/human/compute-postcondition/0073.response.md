The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, we assume this is inside a loop where `j` and `i` are updated in each iteration. However, the `continue` statement does not change the values of `num_data`, `j`, or `i`; it only affects the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state: `num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter the values of the variables `num_data`, `j`, or `i`, these values remain unchanged. Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`**
