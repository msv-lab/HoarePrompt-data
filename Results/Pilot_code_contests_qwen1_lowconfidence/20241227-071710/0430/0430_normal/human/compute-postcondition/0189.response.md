`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `cross_points` and `data` remains unchanged, and the condition regarding the point `(cx, cy)` and its distance to `(x, y)` also remains valid.

Output State: **`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is 1, `data` must contain at least one tuple, `(cx, cy)` is a point such that the Euclidean distance from `(cx, cy)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.**
