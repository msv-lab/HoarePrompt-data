The code appends `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. Since `cp2` is not defined in the initial state, it remains unspecified. However, we know that `cross_points` was originally a list that may have had `cp1` appended under certain conditions. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 1`, `i` is `num_data - 1`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 1]`, `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `cross_points` is the original list with `cp1` appended if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, and `cp2` appended, and `cp1` is either `(x1, y1)` or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` depending on the conditions.**
