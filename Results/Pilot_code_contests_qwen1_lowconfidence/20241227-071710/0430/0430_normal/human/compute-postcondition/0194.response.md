Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `cross_points` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `count` is either 3 or remains 2.
   - `data` must contain at least two tuples.
   - `(cx, cy)` is a point such that the Euclidean distance from `(cx, cy)` to `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.
   - If `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is true, then `count` becomes 3. Otherwise, `count` remains 2.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each `(x, y)` in `data`.
   - For each iteration, the condition `math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `count` becomes 3; otherwise, it remains 2.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each tuple in `data`, and `data` must contain at least two tuples, the loop can continue as long as there are more tuples to process.
   - The variable `cross_points` does not change within the loop based on the given conditions.
   - The variable `count` will remain 3 if the condition is met for all remaining tuples in `data`, or it will remain 2 if the condition is never met.
   - The variable `data` will be reduced by one tuple with each iteration, but it must still contain at least one tuple for the loop to continue.

4. **Final State After Next Iteration:**
   - `cross_points` must still contain at least one tuple.
   - `count` will remain 3 if the condition is met for all remaining tuples, or it will remain 2 if the condition is never met.
   - `data` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we can conclude the following for the next iteration:

- If the condition is true, `count` will be 3.
- If the condition is false, `count` will remain 2.
- `data` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state after the next iteration should be:

State: **`cross_points` must contain at least one tuple, `count` is either 3 or remains 2, `data` must contain at least one tuple**.
