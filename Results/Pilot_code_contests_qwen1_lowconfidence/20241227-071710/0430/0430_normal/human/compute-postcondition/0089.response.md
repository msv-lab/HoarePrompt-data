Postcondition: ***`num_data` is at least 3, `j` is `num_data - 2`, `i` is equal to `j`, `x2` is the first element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[num_data - 2]`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated as tuples such that `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, `cross_points` is a list containing `[cp1]` if `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged. The current value of `cp2[0]` is between 0.0 and 10.0, and the current value of `cp2[1]` is between 0.0 and 10.0***
