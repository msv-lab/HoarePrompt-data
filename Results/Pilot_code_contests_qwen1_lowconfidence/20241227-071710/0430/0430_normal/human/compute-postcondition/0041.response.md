The code assigns `x1, y1` to both `cp1` and `cp2`. Since `cp1` was originally defined as `(x2 + math.cos(th + al), y2 + math.sin(th + al))` and `cp2` was defined as `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))` under certain conditions, these original definitions are no longer valid. Now, `cp1` and `cp2` are simply assigned the values of `x1, y1`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, and `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of `data[1]`, `y2` is the second element of `data[1]`, `cp1` is `x1, y1`, `cp2` is `x1, y1`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`**
