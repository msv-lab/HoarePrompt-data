Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `num_data - 2`
- `j` is `1`
- `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration
- The conditions for appending a point `cp2` to `cross_points` are:
  - The distance between `(x2, y2)` and `(x1, y1)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`
  - `cp2[0]` and `cp2[1]` are within the range `[0.0, 10.0]`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is `num_data - 2`
   - `j` is `1`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `num_data - 1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to determine the new value of `j` for the next iteration.
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

### Conclusion:
- The initial value of `i` (`num_data - 2`) remains unchanged because it does not affect the loop condition.
- The initial value of `j` (`1`) needs to be incremented to `2` for the next iteration.
- The state of `cross_points` and other variables related to the conditions for appending points remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop itself.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration.**

So, the final state before the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `num_data - 2`, `j` is `2`, and `cross_points` is a list containing all valid calculated points from each iteration.**
