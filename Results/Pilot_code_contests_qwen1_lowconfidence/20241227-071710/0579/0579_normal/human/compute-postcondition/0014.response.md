The function `func_6` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 
- `n` is the number of boys, an integer.
- `m` is the number of girls, an integer.
- `k` is the number of couples ready to dance together, an integer.
- `a` is a list of length `k` containing integers between 1 and `n`, representing the boy numbers in the `k` couples.
- `b` is a list of length `k` containing integers between 1 and `m`, representing the girl numbers in the `k` couples.

Case_1: If the conditions are met (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and each couple is specified at most once in the input), the function processes the input and returns the list of couples.
Case_2: If any of the conditions are not met, the function returns an error message indicating the issue.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return the list of couples if the conditions are met. If the conditions are not met, it returns an error message.
