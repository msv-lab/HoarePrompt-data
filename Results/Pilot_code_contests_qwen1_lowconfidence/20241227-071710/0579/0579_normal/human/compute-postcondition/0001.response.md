The code `a = func_2()` assigns the result of calling `func_2()` to the variable `a`. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are all the results of calling `func_2()`, `a` will also be the result of calling `func_2()`. The states of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the result of `func_2()`, `m` is the result of `func_2()`, `k` is the result of `func_2()`, and `a` is the result of `func_2()`**
