Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `ans` is `ans + (k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1)`.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(k)`, meaning it starts from `k - 1` and goes up to `0`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 2`.

4. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is in the range `[0, k-1]`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is currently `k - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `k - 2`.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify `k`.

6. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - The expression `ans = ans + (k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1)` will be evaluated again with `i = k - 2`.

Given these steps, we can now formulate the new state:

**State: `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k - 2`, `ans` is updated according to the formula `ans + (k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1)`**.
