The code snippet `print(ans / 2)` prints the value of `ans` divided by 2. However, the code itself does not change the value of `ans`. It only prints the current value of `ans` and then terminates. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that `ans` is now printed.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the sum of `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, `i` is `k - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists generated by calling `func_2()`, `cntA` and `cntB` are Counter objects for `a` and `b` respectively, and the value of `ans` is printed.**
