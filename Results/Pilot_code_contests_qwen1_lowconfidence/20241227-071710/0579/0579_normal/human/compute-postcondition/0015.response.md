Functionality: **The function `func_6` accepts no explicit parameters but internally calls `func_2()` three times to obtain the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the number of valid dance couples based on the given constraints and returns the result divided by 2. Specifically, it counts the number of valid couples by iterating through the list of couples and checking the counts of boys and girls involved in each couple. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` contains the sum of `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, which is then printed and returned divided by 2. If `k` is 0, `ans` remains 0. The function handles the case where `k` is 0 without explicitly checking the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` against the given constraints.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `k` is 0, the function will set `ans` to 0 and return 0/2, which is 0.
- If the lists `a` and `b` contain duplicate elements or elements outside the specified ranges (1 to `n` and 1 to `m` respectively), the function will still proceed with the calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate the inputs `n`, `m`, and `k` to ensure they meet the constraints `1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5` and that each couple is specified at most once. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if these conditions are not satisfied.
