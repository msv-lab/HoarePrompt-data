The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. This is the only change made by the code. The initial values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cntA`, `cntB`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the result of `func_2()`, `m` is the result of `func_2()`, `k` is the result of `func_2()`, `a` is the result of `func_2()`, `b` is the result of `func_2()`, `cntA` is a Counter object for `a`, `cntB` is a Counter object for `b`, `ans` is 0**
