The code snippet assigns the result of `func_2()` to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, we know that the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are derived from `func_2()`, and they must satisfy the conditions: \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and each couple is specified at most once.

The states of the other variables (`a` and `b`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the result of `func_2()`, `m` is the result of `func_2()`, `k` is the result of `func_2()`, and each couple is specified at most once.**
