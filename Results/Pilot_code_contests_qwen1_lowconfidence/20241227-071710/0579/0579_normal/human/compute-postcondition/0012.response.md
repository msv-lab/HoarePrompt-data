Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the sum of `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, `i` is `k - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists generated by calling `func_2()` and `cntA` and `cntB` are Counter objects for `a` and `b` respectively. If the loop does not execute (`k == 0`), then `ans` remains 0.**
