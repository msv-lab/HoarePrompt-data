To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the information provided and analyze the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is the result of `func_2()`
- `m` is the result of `func_2()`
- `k` is the result of `func_2()`
- `a` is the result of `func_2()`
- `b` is the result of `func_2()`
- `cntA` is a Counter object for `a`
- `cntB` is a Counter object for `b`
- `ans` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in xrange(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop will execute as long as the value of `k` is at least 1 (since `xrange(k)` generates a sequence from 0 to k-1).

### Required Adjustments:
- The variable `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cntA`, `cntB`, and `ans`) are not directly relevant to the loop condition but may be used within the loop body. Since the problem specifies that we should adjust the state to allow the loop to execute, we only need to focus on `k`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0**
