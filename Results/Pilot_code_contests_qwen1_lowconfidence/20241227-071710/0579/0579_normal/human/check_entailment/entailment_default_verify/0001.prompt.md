You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.

Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.

Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.

For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): 

  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (3, 4) and (1, 3); 



But the following combinations are not possible: 

  * (1, 3) and (1, 2) — the first boy enters two pairs; 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 2) — the second girl enters two pairs; 



Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a, b and k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_1, a_2, … a_k. (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a), where a_i is the number of the boy in the pair with the number i.

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_1, b_2, … b_k. (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b), where b_i is the number of the girl in the pair with the number i.

It is guaranteed that the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.

Output

For each test case, on a separate line print one integer — the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.

Example

Input

3 4 4
1 1 2 3
2 3 2 4

2 2 4
1 1 2 2
1 2 1 2


Output

2

Note

In the first test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 2) and (3, 4); 
  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 3) and (3, 4); 
  * (2, 2) and (3, 4). 



There is only one pair in the second test case.

In the third test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 1) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 1).

from collections import defaultdict as ddict, Counter
#Function 1:

    return int(input())

#Function 2:

    return list(map(int, input().split()))

#Function 3:

#Function 4:

#Function 5:

#Function 6:

    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
    print(ans / 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates the number of valid pair combinations without ensuring that the selected pairs do not share any individuals. This can be demonstrated through a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3 3 4
1 1 2 3
2 3 2 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

The expected output is 2 because there are two valid combinations of pairs that do not share any individuals:
- (1, 2) and (3, 1)
- (1, 3) and (2, 1)

However, the provided program would incorrectly count more combinations due to its current logic. Here is a breakdown of why the program fails:

1. The program calculates `ans` using the formula `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1`, which does not ensure that the pairs are distinct.
2. The division by 2 (`print(ans / 2)`) is intended to avoid double-counting, but the logic for selecting pairs that do not share individuals is flawed.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the pairs selected do not share any individuals. A correct approach would involve using a set to track the individuals used in each pair and ensuring that no individual is reused.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 6 : The function `func_6` accepts no explicit parameters but internally calls `func_2()` three times to obtain the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the number of valid dance couples based on the given constraints and returns the result divided by 2. Specifically, it counts the number of valid couples by iterating through the list of couples and checking the counts of boys and girls involved in each couple. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` contains the sum of `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, which is then printed and returned divided by 2. If `k` is 0, `ans` remains 0. The function handles the case where `k` is 0 without explicitly checking the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` against the given constraints.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
