You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.

Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.

Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.

For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): 

  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (3, 4) and (1, 3); 



But the following combinations are not possible: 

  * (1, 3) and (1, 2) — the first boy enters two pairs; 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 2) — the second girl enters two pairs; 



Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a, b and k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_1, a_2, … a_k. (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a), where a_i is the number of the boy in the pair with the number i.

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_1, b_2, … b_k. (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b), where b_i is the number of the girl in the pair with the number i.

It is guaranteed that the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.

Output

For each test case, on a separate line print one integer — the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.

Example

Input


3
3 4 4
1 1 2 3
2 3 2 4
1 1 1
1
1
2 2 4
1 1 2 2
1 2 1 2


Output


4
0
2

Note

In the first test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 2) and (3, 4); 
  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 3) and (3, 4); 
  * (2, 2) and (3, 4). 



There is only one pair in the second test case.

In the third test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 1) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 1).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs of couples. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the inputs for the number of boys, girls, and pairs, along with the specific pairs of boys and girls.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how many times each boy and each girl appears in the pairs.

3. **Calculating Valid Pairs**: The formula used to calculate the number of valid pairs (choosing 2 out of k pairs without overlap) is correct:
   \[
   \text{ans} += k - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 1
   \]
   This accounts for the fact that we subtract the counts of the current boy and girl from the total number of remaining pairs.

4. **Final Calculation**: The result is divided by 2 to account for double counting (since choosing pair A and B is the same as choosing B and A).

Since the program correctly handles the given problem statement and all examples provided, and there are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
