Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs of couples. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the inputs for the number of boys, girls, and pairs, along with the specific pairs of boys and girls.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how many times each boy and each girl appears in the pairs.

3. **Calculating Valid Pairs**: The formula used to calculate the number of valid pairs (choosing 2 out of k pairs without overlap) is correct:
   \[
   \text{ans} += k - \text{cntA}[a[i]] - \text{cntB}[b[i]] + 1
   \]
   This accounts for the fact that we subtract the counts of the current boy and girl from the total number of remaining pairs.

4. **Final Calculation**: The result is divided by 2 to account for double counting (since choosing pair A and B is the same as choosing B and A).

Since the program correctly handles the given problem statement and all examples provided, and there are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws, the program is correct.
