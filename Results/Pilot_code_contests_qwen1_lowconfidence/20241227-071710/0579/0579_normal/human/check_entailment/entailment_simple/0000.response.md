Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the calculation of the number of ways to choose two pairs that meet the conditions is flawed. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Pairs**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid pairs using the formula `ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1`. This formula does not correctly account for selecting two distinct pairs where no person is in more than one pair.
   - The variable `ans` should be incremented by the number of remaining valid pairs after selecting one pair. However, the current logic incorrectly counts overlapping selections.

2. **Overlapping Pairs**:
   - When a pair is selected, both the boy and girl in that pair cannot be part of another pair. The current implementation does not properly handle this exclusion, leading to an incorrect count of valid pairs.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to use a different approach to ensure that no person is included in more than one pair. One effective way is to use a combinatorial method:

1. **Count Valid Pairs**:
   - Use a set to keep track of boys and girls who are already paired.
   - For each pair, check if the boy and girl are not already paired.
   - If they are not paired, add the pair to the count and mark the boy and girl as paired.

2. **Calculate Combinations**:
   - Once you have the valid pairs, calculate the number of ways to choose 2 pairs out of the valid pairs.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter
from itertools import combinations

def func_6(n, m, k, a, b):
    paired_boys = set()
    paired_girls = set()
    valid_pairs = []
    
    for i in range(k):
        boy, girl = a[i], b[i]
        if boy not in paired_boys and girl not in paired_girls:
            valid_pairs.append((boy, girl))
            paired_boys.add(boy)
            paired_girls.add(girl)
    
    if len(valid_pairs) < 2:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 pairs from the valid pairs
    return len(list(combinations(valid_pairs, 2)))

# Function to process each test case
def process_test_case():
    n, m, k = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    return str(func_6(n, m, k, a, b))

# Main function to process all test cases
def func_6_main():
    t = func_1()
    results = [process_test_case() for _ in range(t)]
    func_5(results, '\n')

# Execute the main function
func_6_main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Tracking Paired Individuals**:
   - Use sets `paired_boys` and `paired_girls` to keep track of boys and girls who are already paired.
   
2. **Valid Pairs**:
   - Iterate through each pair and check if the boy and girl are not already paired. If they are not, add the pair to `valid_pairs` and mark them as paired.

3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - Use `combinations` from `itertools` to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 pairs from the valid pairs.

This approach ensures that no person is included in more than one pair and correctly counts the number of valid pairs.
