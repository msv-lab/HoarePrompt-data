Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where the number of boys and girls in a class is not equal, i.e., \(a \neq b\). According to the problem description, the number of boys and girls must be equal for the pairs to be selected correctly. However, the current implementation assumes \(a = b\) implicitly by counting the occurrences of boys and girls in the pairs and performing calculations based on this assumption.

For example, consider the following test case:
- \(a = 3\)
- \(b = 4\)
- \(k = 4\)
- Couples: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4)

The code will count the occurrences of boys and girls and attempt to calculate the number of valid pairs. However, since \(a \neq b\), the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs will be incorrect, leading to a wrong output.

To fix this, the code needs to handle the case where \(a \neq b\) and ensure that the number of valid pairs is calculated correctly even when the number of boys and girls are not equal.
