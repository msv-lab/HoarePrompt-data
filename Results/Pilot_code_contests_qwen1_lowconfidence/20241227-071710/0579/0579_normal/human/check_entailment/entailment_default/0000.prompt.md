You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.

Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.

Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.

For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): 

  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (3, 4) and (1, 3); 



But the following combinations are not possible: 

  * (1, 3) and (1, 2) — the first boy enters two pairs; 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 2) — the second girl enters two pairs; 



Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a, b and k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_1, a_2, … a_k. (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a), where a_i is the number of the boy in the pair with the number i.

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_1, b_2, … b_k. (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b), where b_i is the number of the girl in the pair with the number i.

It is guaranteed that the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.

Output

For each test case, on a separate line print one integer — the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.

Example

Input


3
3 4 4
1 1 2 3
2 3 2 4
1 1 1
1
1
2 2 4
1 1 2 2
1 2 1 2


Output


4
0
2

Note

In the first test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 2) and (3, 4); 
  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 3) and (3, 4); 
  * (2, 2) and (3, 4). 



There is only one pair in the second test case.

In the third test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 1) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 1).

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns that integer if it falls within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). If the input is outside this range, the function does not explicitly handle this case and will continue to prompt the user for input until a valid integer within the range is provided. There are no additional actions performed beyond reading and validating the input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads input from the user, which includes the number of test cases, the number of boys and girls in each class, the number of couples, and the specific boy and girl numbers in those couples. It then returns a list of integers representing the boy and girl numbers in the specified couples. The function processes the input line by line, splitting the input into integers and mapping them to a list. Potential edge cases include handling multiple test cases, ensuring the correct number of boy and girl numbers match the specified couples, and managing incorrect or invalid inputs. If the input does not follow the expected format, the function may not produce the intended output.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` takes no parameters and returns a list of strings representing the input values of `a`, `b`, and `k` for each test case. However, the provided code does not correctly read the input values; instead, it reads a single input as a string and splits it into a list of characters. Therefore, the function does not achieve its intended purpose of returning the correct input values as strings.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4()` accepts an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it expects additional inputs `a`, `b`, and `k`, along with two lists of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. However, the function does not process these additional inputs; instead, it simply returns the input provided for each test case without any modifications. The function does not perform any operations on the lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. The overall state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the input provided for each test case, assuming the input adheres to the specified constraints (i.e., `1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ a` and `1 ≤ b_i ≤ b` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ k`). If any of the inputs do not meet these constraints, the function will still return the input but without validating or processing these constraints.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l, sep='\n'):
    print(sep.join(l))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and a separator `sep`. It joins the elements of the list `l` using the separator `sep` and prints the resulting string. The function does not return any value. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotation or code that need to be handled separately. The function will join and print the list elements regardless of their values or the type of separator provided.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, m, k) = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
    print(ans / 2)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts no explicit parameters but internally calls `func_2()` three times to obtain the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the number of valid dance couples based on the given constraints and returns the result divided by 2. Specifically, it counts the number of valid couples by iterating through the list of couples and checking the counts of boys and girls involved in each couple. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` contains the sum of `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, which is then printed and returned divided by 2. If `k` is 0, `ans` remains 0. The function handles the case where `k` is 0 without explicitly checking the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` against the given constraints.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
