Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_6` calculates the number of valid pairs of couples but does not ensure that the selected pairs do not share any participants. The formula used to calculate `ans` does not account for the constraint that no person can be in more than one pair. 

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The formula `ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` does not correctly account for the constraint that no person can be in more than one pair. This formula calculates the number of remaining valid pairs for each couple `(a[i], b[i])`, but it does not ensure that the selected pairs are disjoint.

2. **Lack of Pair Selection Logic**: The code does not explicitly select two disjoint pairs. Instead, it iterates through the list of couples and adds to a cumulative count, which does not guarantee that the pairs are disjoint.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  3 4 4
  1 1 2 3
  2 3 2 4
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  4
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  The code will incorrectly calculate the number of valid pairs, potentially counting overlapping pairs, leading to an incorrect result.

Since the code does not correctly handle the selection of disjoint pairs, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
