#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input from the user, which is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns that integer if it falls within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). If the input is outside this range, the function does not explicitly handle this case and will continue to prompt the user for input until a valid integer within the range is provided. There are no additional actions performed beyond reading and validating the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are integers representing the number of boys and girls in the class respectively, k is an integer representing the number of couples ready to dance together, the next line contains k integers representing the boy numbers in the k couples, and the following line contains k integers representing the girl numbers in the k couples.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #`The program returns a list of integers representing the boy and girl numbers in the k couples as input by the user`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, which includes the number of test cases, the number of boys and girls in each class, the number of couples, and the specific boy and girl numbers in those couples. It then returns a list of integers representing the boy and girl numbers in the specified couples. The function processes the input line by line, splitting the input into integers and mapping them to a list. Potential edge cases include handling multiple test cases, ensuring the correct number of boy and girl numbers match the specified couples, and managing incorrect or invalid inputs. If the input does not follow the expected format, the function may not produce the intended output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k contain k integers each, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b for all i in the range 1 to k.
def func_3():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of strings representing the input values of a, b, and k for each test case
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` takes no parameters and returns a list of strings representing the input values of `a`, `b`, and `k` for each test case. However, the provided code does not correctly read the input values; instead, it reads a single input as a string and splits it into a list of characters. Therefore, the function does not achieve its intended purpose of returning the correct input values as strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a, b, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ a and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ b for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #`The program returns the input provided for each test case, given that t is the number of test cases and for each test case, a, b, and k are integers with specified ranges, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and b_1, b_2, ..., b_k are lists of integers within certain bounds
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` accepts an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it expects additional inputs `a`, `b`, and `k`, along with two lists of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. However, the function does not process these additional inputs; instead, it simply returns the input provided for each test case without any modifications. The function does not perform any operations on the lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. The overall state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the input provided for each test case, assuming the input adheres to the specified constraints (i.e., `1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ a` and `1 ≤ b_i ≤ b` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ k`). If any of the inputs do not meet these constraints, the function will still return the input but without validating or processing these constraints.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above for each test case. The length of the list l is equal to the number of test cases t.
def func_5(l, sep):
    print(sep.join(l))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and a separator `sep`. It joins the elements of the list `l` using the separator `sep` and prints the resulting string. The function does not return any value. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotation or code that need to be handled separately. The function will join and print the list elements regardless of their values or the type of separator provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is the number of boys, m is the number of girls, and k is the number of couples ready to dance together. a is a list of length k containing integers between 1 and n, representing the boy numbers in the k couples. b is a list of length k containing integers between 1 and m, representing the girl numbers in the k couples. The values of n, m, k, a, and b are such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and each couple is specified at most once in the input.
def func_6():
    n, m, k = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the sum of `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, `i` is `k - 1`, `a` and `b` are lists generated by calling `func_2()` and `cntA` and `cntB` are Counter objects for `a` and `b` respectively. If the loop does not execute (`k == 0`), then `ans` remains 0.
    print(ans / 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts no explicit parameters but internally calls `func_2()` three times to obtain the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the number of valid dance couples based on the given constraints and returns the result divided by 2. Specifically, it counts the number of valid couples by iterating through the list of couples and checking the counts of boys and girls involved in each couple. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` contains the sum of `k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, which is then printed and returned divided by 2. If `k` is 0, `ans` remains 0. The function handles the case where `k` is 0 without explicitly checking the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` against the given constraints.
