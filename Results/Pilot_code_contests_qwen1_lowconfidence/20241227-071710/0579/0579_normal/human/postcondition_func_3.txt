The function `func_4()` accepts an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it expects additional inputs `a`, `b`, and `k`, along with two lists of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. However, the function does not process these additional inputs; instead, it simply returns the input provided for each test case without any modifications. The function does not perform any operations on the lists `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`. The overall state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the input provided for each test case, assuming the input adheres to the specified constraints (i.e., `1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5` and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ a` and `1 ≤ b_i ≤ b` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ k`). If any of the inputs do not meet these constraints, the function will still return the input but without validating or processing these constraints.
