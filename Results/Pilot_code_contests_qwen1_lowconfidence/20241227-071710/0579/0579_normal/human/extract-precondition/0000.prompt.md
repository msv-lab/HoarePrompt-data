You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the graduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be attended by pairs of boys and girls.

Each class must present two couples to the ball. In Vasya's class, a boys and b girls wish to participate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.

Formally, you know k possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose two of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair.

For example, if a=3, b=4, k=4 and the couples (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4) are ready to dance together (in each pair, the boy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following combinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed below): 

  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (3, 4) and (1, 3); 



But the following combinations are not possible: 

  * (1, 3) and (1, 2) — the first boy enters two pairs; 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 2) — the second girl enters two pairs; 



Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the condition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of different pairs.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers a, b and k (1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of boys and girls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_1, a_2, … a_k. (1 ≤ a_i ≤ a), where a_i is the number of the boy in the pair with the number i.

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_1, b_2, … b_k. (1 ≤ b_i ≤ b), where b_i is the number of the girl in the pair with the number i.

It is guaranteed that the sums of a, b, and k over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

It is guaranteed that each pair is specified at most once in one test case.

Output

For each test case, on a separate line print one integer — the number of ways to choose two pairs that match the condition above.

Example

Input

Note

In the first test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 2) and (3, 4); 
  * (1, 3) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 3) and (3, 4); 
  * (2, 2) and (3, 4). 



There is only one pair in the second test case.

In the third test case, the following combinations of pairs fit: 

  * (1, 1) and (2, 2); 
  * (1, 2) and (2, 1). 
Program:
```
def func_6():
    (n, m, k) = func_2()
    a = func_2()
    b = func_2()
    cntA = Counter(a)
    cntB = Counter(b)
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(k):
        ans += k - cntA[a[i]] - cntB[b[i]] + 1
    print(ans / 2)
```
