The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns that integer if it falls within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). If the input is outside this range, the function does not explicitly handle this case and will continue to prompt the user for input until a valid integer within the range is provided. There are no additional actions performed beyond reading and validating the input.
