The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers and a separator `sep`. It joins the elements of the list `l` using the separator `sep` and prints the resulting string. The function does not return any value. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotation or code that need to be handled separately. The function will join and print the list elements regardless of their values or the type of separator provided.
