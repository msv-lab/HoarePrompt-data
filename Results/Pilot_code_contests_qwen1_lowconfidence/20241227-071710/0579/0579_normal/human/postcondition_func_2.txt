The function `func_3()` takes no parameters and returns a list of strings representing the input values of `a`, `b`, and `k` for each test case. However, the provided code does not correctly read the input values; instead, it reads a single input as a string and splits it into a list of characters. Therefore, the function does not achieve its intended purpose of returning the correct input values as strings.
