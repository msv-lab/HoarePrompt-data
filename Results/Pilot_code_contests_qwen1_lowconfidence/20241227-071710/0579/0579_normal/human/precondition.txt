t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists containing k integers each represent the boy and girl numbers in the k possible couples, where each boy number is between 1 and a, and each girl number is between 1 and b. No pair is repeated within a single test case.
