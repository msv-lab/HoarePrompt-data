The function reads input from the user, which includes the number of test cases, the number of boys and girls in each class, the number of couples, and the specific boy and girl numbers in those couples. It then returns a list of integers representing the boy and girl numbers in the specified couples. The function processes the input line by line, splitting the input into integers and mapping them to a list. Potential edge cases include handling multiple test cases, ensuring the correct number of boy and girl numbers match the specified couples, and managing incorrect or invalid inputs. If the input does not follow the expected format, the function may not produce the intended output.
