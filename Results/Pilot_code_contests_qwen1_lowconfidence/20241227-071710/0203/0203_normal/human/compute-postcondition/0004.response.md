The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are lists of integers, where each element in `a` represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and each element in `b` represents the fragrantness of a sardine. The length of both lists is `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5), and the values of `A_i` and `B_i` satisfy -10^{18} ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ 10^{18} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N.

The function can return in two cases:
- Case_1: It returns a list `b` of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine.
- Case_2: It returns the result of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)` where `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines, and `a % b` is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of sardines modulo their corresponding fragrantness values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `a` and `b`, and return either the list `b` or the result of calling `func_1(b, a % b)`.
