Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers. Each element in `a` represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and each element in `b` represents the fragrantness of a sardine. Both lists have the same length \(N\) (1 ≤ \(N\) ≤ 2 × 10^5), and the values of \(A_i\) and \(B_i\) satisfy -10^18 ≤ \(A_i\), \(B_i\) ≤ 10^18 for all 1 ≤ \(i\) ≤ \(N\).

The function recursively computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `a` and `b`. If `a` is divisible by `b`, the function immediately returns `b`. Otherwise, it calls itself with the arguments swapped and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

The function can return in two cases:
- **Case 1:** If `a` is divisible by `b` at any point, the function returns the list `b`.
- **Case 2:** If no such case occurs, the function eventually returns the GCD of the original `a` and `b` as a list, with each element being the GCD value repeated `N` times.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `a` or `b` contains a zero, the function will still compute the GCD correctly, but if `a` is zero, the function will return `b` if `b` is not zero. If both `a` and `b` are zero, the behavior is undefined due to the modulus operation.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where `a` and `b` are empty lists. In practice, the GCD of an empty list is considered to be 0, but this is not explicitly covered in the given code.**

This summary covers the actual functionality and potential edge cases of the function based on the provided code and annotations.
