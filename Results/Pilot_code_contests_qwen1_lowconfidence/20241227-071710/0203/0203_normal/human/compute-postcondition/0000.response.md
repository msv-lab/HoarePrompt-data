Postcondition: **a is a list of integers where each element represents the deliciousness of a sardine, b is a list of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine. Both lists have the same length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5), and -10^{18} ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ 10^{18} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N. The condition a[i] % b[i] == 0 holds for at least one i where 1 ≤ i ≤ N.**
