Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach than what is described in the problem statement.

#### Issues:

1. **Problem Description and Functionality Mismatch:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of ways to choose sardines such that no two sardines on bad terms are chosen simultaneously.
   - The program uses a gcd-based approach to categorize pairs of sardines and counts the number of valid sets. However, this approach is not directly addressing the problem as stated.

2. **Incorrect Use of GCD and Slope-Based Categorization:**
   - The program calculates slopes (`m1`, `m2`) and uses a dictionary to count occurrences of these slopes. This method seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the problem constraints and requirements.
   - The gcd-based categorization does not accurately reflect the constraint \( A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0 \).

3. **Function `func_1` Misunderstanding:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, but it does not seem to be used correctly in the context of the problem.
   - The function's implementation is irrelevant to the problem's requirement of counting valid subsets of sardines.

4. **Incorrect Counting Logic:**
   - The program's logic for counting valid subsets is flawed. It incorrectly sums the powers of 2 and subtracts 1 without proper handling of the constraints.
   - The final result is computed modulo 1000000007, but the overall logic does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, one should use a combination of combinatorial techniques and bitmask dynamic programming. Hereâ€™s a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. **Bitmask DP:** Use a bitmask to represent the state of choosing sardines.
2. **Graph Representation:** Represent the sardines as nodes in a graph where edges exist between sardines that are on bad terms.
3. **Dynamic Programming Transition:** Use dynamic programming to count the number of valid subsets by considering each bit in the bitmask.

The provided program does not follow this approach and instead uses a method that does not accurately address the problem's constraints.

Therefore, the program is **False** because it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
