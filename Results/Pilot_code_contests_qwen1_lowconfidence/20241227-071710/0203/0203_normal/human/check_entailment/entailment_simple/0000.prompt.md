You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have caught N sardines. The deliciousness and fragrantness of the i-th sardine is A_i and B_i, respectively.

We will choose one or more of these sardines and put them into a cooler. However, two sardines on bad terms cannot be chosen at the same time.

The i-th and j-th sardines (i \neq j) are on bad terms if and only if A_i \cdot A_j + B_i \cdot B_j = 0.

In how many ways can we choose the set of sardines to put into the cooler? Since the count can be enormous, print it modulo 1000000007.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* -10^{18} \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^{18}

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 B_1
:
A_N B_N


Output

Print the count modulo 1000000007.

Examples

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
n = int(raw_input())
ns = []
d = defaultdict(int)
for i in xrange(n):
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ns.append((a, b))
    if a and b:
        s = 1 if a * b >= 0 else -1
        g = func_1(abs(a), abs(b))
        m1 = (s * abs(a) / g, abs(b) / g)
        m2 = (-s * abs(b) / g, abs(a) / g)
    elif a == 0 and b == 0:
        continue
    elif a == 0:
        m1 = (1, 0)
        m2 = (0, 1)
    elif b == 0:
        m1 = (0, 1)
        m2 = (1, 0)
    d[m1] += 1
    d[m2] += 0
pre = 1
for k in d.keys():
    if k[0] < 0:
        assert (k[1], -k[0]) in d
        continue
    elif k[0] == 0:
        pre = pre * d[k] % MOD
    else:
        k1 = k
        k2 = (-k[1], k[0])
        tot = pow(2, d[k1], MOD) + pow(2, d[k2], MOD) - 1
        pre = pre * tot % MOD
print(pre - 1 + MOD) % MOD

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where each element represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and b is a list of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine. Both lists have the same length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5), and -10^{18} ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ 10^{18} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return b
        #The program returns a list 'b' of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a is a list of integers where each element represents the deliciousness of a sardine, and b is a list of integers where each element represents the fragrantness of a sardine. Both lists have the same length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5), and -10^{18} ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ 10^{18} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N. The condition (a % b != 0) holds for at least one element in the lists.
    return func_1(b, a % b)
    #The program returns the result of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)` where `b` is a list of integers representing the fragrantness of sardines, and `a % b` is a list of integers representing the deliciousness of sardines modulo their corresponding fragrantness values.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
