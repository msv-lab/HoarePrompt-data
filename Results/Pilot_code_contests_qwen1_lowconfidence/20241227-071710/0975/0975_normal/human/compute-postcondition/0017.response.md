Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `total` is unspecified.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000].
   - `m` must be greater than `n`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The for loop iterates over `range(m)`, meaning the loop variable `i` will increment from 0 up to `m-1`.

3. **Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`.
   - Since the loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute one more time when `i` becomes `n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` needs to be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (an integer within the range [3, 150,000]).
   - `m` still must be greater than `n` because it was initially specified as such.

6. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `total` remains unspecified.
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `m` must still be greater than `n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n`**.

State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n`**
