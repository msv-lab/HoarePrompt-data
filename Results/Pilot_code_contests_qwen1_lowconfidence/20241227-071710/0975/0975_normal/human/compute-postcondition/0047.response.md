The code `checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()` removes and returns an element from the set `leftToCheck`. This means that the set `leftToCheck` loses one element, and the variable `checkMe` is assigned the value of this removed element.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `isGood` is `False` if any neighbor's list of neighbors does not match `cliqueSize`, otherwise `isGood` is `True`; `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element, and `checkMe` is the value of the removed element from `leftToCheck`.**
