The code sets `leftToCheck` to an empty set, which was previously an empty set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `neighbor` is a node in the graph; the length of the list of neighbors of `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set.
