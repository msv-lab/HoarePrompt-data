The code `leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))` removes the set of `neighbors` from the `leftToCheck` set, if it exists. Initially, `leftToCheck` is an empty set. Since the set to be discarded is derived from `neighbors`, and initially `leftToCheck` is empty, no action is taken because there is nothing to discard.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `isGood` is `False` if any neighbor's list of neighbors does not match `cliqueSize`, otherwise `isGood` is `True`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set.**
