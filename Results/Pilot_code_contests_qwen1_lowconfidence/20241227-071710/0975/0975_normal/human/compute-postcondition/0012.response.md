The code `graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])` appends `edge[0]` to the list associated with the key `edge[1]` in the dictionary `graph`. The value of `edge` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values being appended. However, we know the following:

- `total` is unspecified.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000].
- `m` must be greater than `n - 1`.
- `graph` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) maps to a list, and `graph[edge[0]]` now contains `edge[1]` in its list.

After executing the code, the value of `graph[edge[1]]` will include `edge[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n - 1`, `graph[edge[1]]` now contains both `edge[1]` and `edge[0]` in its list.**
