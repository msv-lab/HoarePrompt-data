The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as indicated in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints and relationships given, it appears that the function should process some input data related to friendships among members.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(0 \leq m \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\).
- The following `m` lines contain pairs of distinct integers `(ai, bi)` such that \(1 \leq ai, bi \leq n\) and \(ai \neq bi\), representing that members `ai` and `bi` are friends. No pair `(ai, bi)` repeats within the input.

From the output description, it seems that the function processes these friendship pairs and returns some result based on the friendships. However, since no specific output cases are mentioned, we can only state what the function accepts.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a set of friendship pairs among `n` members and return a result based on these friendships.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of friendship pairs among `n` members and returns a result based on these friendships.**
