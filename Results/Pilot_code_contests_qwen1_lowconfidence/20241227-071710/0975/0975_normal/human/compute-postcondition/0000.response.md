The code reads two integers from standard input, `n` and `m`, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. Since the original values of `n` and `m` are read from input, their specific values are not known until runtime. However, we know that the initial constraints for `n` and `m` are 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.

After the code execution, the values of `n` and `m` will be updated to the integers read from the input. The relationships between `n` and `m` remain as initially defined, but the exact values depend on user input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the first input line and `m` is the integer read from the second input line, where 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 150,000 and 0 ≤ `m` ≤ (`n` * (`n` - 1)) / 2.**
