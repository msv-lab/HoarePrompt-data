According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is an integer, `graph` is a dictionary containing the key 1 with the value [], and `i` is 0.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1 (as it was 0 at the end of the previous iteration).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 1, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `n` remains an integer within the range [3, 150,000]
- `m` remains an integer
- `graph` remains a dictionary containing the key 1 with the value []
- `i` is now 1

State: **`n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is an integer, `graph` is a dictionary containing the key 1 with the value [], `i` is 1**
