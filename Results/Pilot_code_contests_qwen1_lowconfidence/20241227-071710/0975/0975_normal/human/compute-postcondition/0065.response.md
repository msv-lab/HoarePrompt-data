Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` remains `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` excluding the current neighbor, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`. If `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
