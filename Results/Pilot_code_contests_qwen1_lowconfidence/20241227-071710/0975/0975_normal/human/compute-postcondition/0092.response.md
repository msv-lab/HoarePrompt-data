The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variables. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is the output printed, but the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is True indicating all nodes in the graph form cliques with their neighbors, `graph` is the final state of the graph after checking all nodes, `checkMe` is the last node that was checked, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` after all checks, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`. Printed to console: YES**
