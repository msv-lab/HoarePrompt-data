`leftToCheck` is an empty set, so discarding `set(neighbors)` from an empty set does not change the set. The value of `neighbors` and `cliqueSize` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`isGood` is either `True` or `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`.**
