The code `cliqueSize = len(neighbors)` calculates the length of the `neighbors` list and assigns it to `cliqueSize`. The value of `neighbors` is a list of nodes connected to `checkMe`, so `cliqueSize` will be the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.

The output state includes the updated value of `cliqueSize` and mentions that the other variables remain unchanged according to their preconditions.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `isGood` is `False` if any neighbor's list of neighbors does not match `cliqueSize`, otherwise `isGood` is `True`; `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element, and `checkMe` is the value of the removed element from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe`; `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.**
