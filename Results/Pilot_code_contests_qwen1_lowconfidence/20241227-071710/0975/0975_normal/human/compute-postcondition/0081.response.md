The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; instead, it breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given initial state, the `break` statement does not affect the variables `isGood` or `leftToCheck`.

Output State: **`isGood` is False, `leftToCheck` is a set([])**
