Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`.
   - `isGood` remains `False`.
   - `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`.
   - `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` (potentially excluding elements checked previously).
   - `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `while len(leftToCheck) > 0:`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `len(leftToCheck) > 0` must be true.
   - However, at the end of the previous iteration, `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`. This means `len(leftToCheck)` is 0.
   - Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because the condition `len(leftToCheck) > 0` is false.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `leftToCheck` is currently an empty set, we need to adjust it to ensure that the length of `leftToCheck` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `leftToCheck` to ensure it is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`leftToCheck` is not an empty set**
