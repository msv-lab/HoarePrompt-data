The code appends `edge[1]` to the list `graph[edge[0]]`. Since `edge[0]` and `edge[1]` are integers read from standard input, and `graph[edge[1]]` initially contains both `edge[1]` and `edge[0]`, appending `edge[1]` to `graph[edge[0]]` does not change the existing elements in `graph[edge[0]]` because `edge[1]` is already present there.

The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `edge[0]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n`, `edge[0]` and `edge[1]` are integers read from standard input, and `graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` appends `edge[1]` to the list `graph[edge[0]]` (which already contains `edge[1]`)**.
