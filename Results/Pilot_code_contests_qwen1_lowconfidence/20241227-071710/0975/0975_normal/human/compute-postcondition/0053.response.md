The code sets `leftToCheck` to an empty set. This directly updates the value of `leftToCheck`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` is `False`, `leftToCheck` is a set with no elements, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` and is not an empty list, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe**, and `isGood` is reassigned to `False`.
