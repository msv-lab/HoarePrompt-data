According to the given code, the loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `neighbors`. The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, `isGood` is set to `False` and `leftToCheck` is set to an empty set `[]`. Otherwise, the values of `isGood` and `leftToCheck` remain unchanged.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State**: We need to consider the initial state at the start of the first iteration or the state at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are neighbors to check.
3. **Update Conditions**: If `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, the loop terminates early, setting `isGood` to `False` and `leftToCheck` to `[]`.

Given that the loop continues based on the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) == cliqueSize`, if this condition fails for any neighbor, the loop will terminate. If it holds true for all neighbors, `isGood` and `leftToCheck` remain unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the loop can continue to the next iteration. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the current `neighbor` being checked must satisfy the condition `len(graph[neighbor]) == cliqueSize`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the next `neighbor` in the iteration satisfies the condition.

State: **`graph` and `cliqueSize` are as they were before, if `len(graph[neighbor])` is equal to `cliqueSize`, then `isGood` remains unchanged and `leftToCheck` remains unchanged, otherwise, `isGood` is set to `False` and `leftToCheck` is set to `[]`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next `neighbor` must satisfy `len(graph[neighbor]) == cliqueSize`.**

State: **`graph` and `cliqueSize` are as they were before, `isGood` remains unchanged, and `leftToCheck` remains unchanged, assuming the next `neighbor` in the iteration satisfies `len(graph[neighbor]) == cliqueSize`.**
