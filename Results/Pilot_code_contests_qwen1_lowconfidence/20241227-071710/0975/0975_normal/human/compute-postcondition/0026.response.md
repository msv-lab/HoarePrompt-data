The code assigns the value of the neighbors of `checkMe` from the `graph` dictionary to the variable `neighbors`. This does not change the values of any other variables.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is the number of edges added to the graph, `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of its neighbors, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m+1` to `n` excluding `checkMe`, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is an integer in the range [m+1, n], `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` in the graph.**
