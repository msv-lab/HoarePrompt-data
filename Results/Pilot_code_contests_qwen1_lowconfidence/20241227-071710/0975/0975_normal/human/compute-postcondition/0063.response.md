The code sets `leftToCheck` to an empty set. This directly updates the value of `leftToCheck`. The other variables (`graph`, `isGood`, `checkMe`, `neighbors`, and `cliqueSize`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` is `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` excluding the current neighbor, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`**
