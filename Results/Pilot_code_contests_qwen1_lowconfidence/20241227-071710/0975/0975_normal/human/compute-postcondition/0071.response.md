The code `cliqueSize = len(neighbors)` calculates the length of the `neighbors` list and assigns it to the variable `cliqueSize`. The value of `cliqueSize` will be the number of elements in the `neighbors` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`; `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element than before; `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`; `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`**
