The code initializes `leftToCheck` as an empty set. This operation does not affect the values of `graph`, `neighbor`, `cliqueSize`, or `isGood`. Therefore, the only change is that `leftToCheck` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `neighbor` is a node in the graph; the length of the list of neighbors of `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set.**
