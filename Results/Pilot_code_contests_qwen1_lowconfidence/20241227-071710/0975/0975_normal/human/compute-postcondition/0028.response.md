Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop iterates over the `neighbors` list. For the loop to execute, `neighbors` must contain at least one element.

2. **Current States**:
   - `i` is `m`.
   - `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000].
   - `m` is the number of edges added to the graph.
   - `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary.
   - `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m+1` to `n` excluding `checkMe`.
   - `isGood` is `True`.
   - `checkMe` is an integer in the range [m+1, n].
   - `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` in the graph.
   - `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors that `checkMe` has.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if and only if the `neighbors` list is non-empty (i.e., contains at least one element).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `neighbors` is a non-empty list. This means that `checkMe` must have at least one neighbor in the graph.

Given this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `checkMe` must have at least one neighbor in the graph, meaning the length of the `neighbors` list must be greater than 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is the number of edges added to the graph, `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m+1` to `n` excluding `checkMe`, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is an integer in the range [m+1, n], `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` in the graph (must be non-empty), and `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors that `checkMe` has.**
