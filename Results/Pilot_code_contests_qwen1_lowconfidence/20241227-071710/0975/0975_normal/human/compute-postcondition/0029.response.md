Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors. `neighbor` is a node in the graph. The length of the list of neighbors of `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`. The overall state of the program after entering the if condition is that the if statement evaluates to true because the length of the list of neighbors of `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.***
