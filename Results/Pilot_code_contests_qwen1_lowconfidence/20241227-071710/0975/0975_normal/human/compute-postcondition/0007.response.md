The code snippet `graph[i + 1] = []` creates a new empty list at the index `i + 1` in the `graph` list. The previous value of `graph[i + 1]` was undefined (or potentially `None` if it didn't exist before), but now it is set to an empty list. The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph[i + 1]` is an empty list**
