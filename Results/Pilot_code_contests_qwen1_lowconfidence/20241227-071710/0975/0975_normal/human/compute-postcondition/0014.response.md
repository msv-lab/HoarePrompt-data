The code reads two integers from standard input using `map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` and assigns them to the variable `edge`. The values of `edge[0]` and `edge[1]` are converted to integers. 

- The initial state includes: `total` is unspecified, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n`, and `graph[edge[1]]` contains both `edge[1]` and `edge[0]` in its list.
- After the code executes, `edge[0]` and `edge[1]` are updated to the integers read from the standard input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n`, `edge[0]` and `edge[1]` are integers read from standard input, and `graph[edge[1]]` contains both `edge[1]` and `edge[0]` in its list.**
