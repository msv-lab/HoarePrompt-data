Postcondition: ***`checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`, `neighbor` is each element in `neighbors` during the loop execution. If `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, then `isGood` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues without changing `isGood`.***
