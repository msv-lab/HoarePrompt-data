According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is an integer read from the first input line and the constraints are \(3 \leq n \leq 150,000\), we know that `n` will always be a positive integer.

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range and set the initial value of `i` to 0, as the loop will start iterating from `i = 0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is an integer, `graph` is an empty dictionary, and `i` is 0**
