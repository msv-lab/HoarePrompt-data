The code appends `edge[0]` to the list `graph[edge[1]]`. Given the initial state, the variables `total` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000]. Since `m` must be greater than `n`, `m` also remains unchanged. The only variable that changes is `graph[edge[1]]`, which now contains its original value plus `edge[0]`.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is greater than `n`, `graph[edge[1]]` contains the value `edge[1]` appended with `edge[0]`.**
