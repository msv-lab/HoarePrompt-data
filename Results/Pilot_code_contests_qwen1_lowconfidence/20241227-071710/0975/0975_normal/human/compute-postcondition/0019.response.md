The code appends `edge[1]` to the list `graph[edge[0]]`. The variables `total` and `m` are not affected by this line of code. The variable `i` is not a list or a map, so it is not impacted by this operation. 

Since `edge` is a map object, `edge[0]` refers to a key in the map, and `edge[1]` refers to its corresponding value. This operation modifies the list associated with the key `edge[0]` by appending `edge[1]` to it.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n`, `graph[edge[0]]` contains the value `edge[1]` appended to it.**
