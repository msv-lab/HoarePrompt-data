Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `neighbor` is a node in the graph; `isGood` remains `False`; `leftToCheck` remains an empty set. If the length of the list of neighbors of `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
