The code initializes an empty dictionary named `graph`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `m`, but it sets the state of `graph` to an empty dictionary. Therefore, the output state includes the updated state of `graph`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the first input line and `m` is the integer read from the second input line, where 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 150,000 and 0 ≤ `m` ≤ (`n` * (`n` - 1)) / 2; `graph` is an empty dictionary {}**
