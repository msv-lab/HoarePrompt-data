The variable `isGood` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state of `graph` and `neighbor` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `neighbor` is a node in the graph; the length of the list of neighbors of `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is `False`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `neighbor` is a node in the graph; the length of the list of neighbors of `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is `False`**
