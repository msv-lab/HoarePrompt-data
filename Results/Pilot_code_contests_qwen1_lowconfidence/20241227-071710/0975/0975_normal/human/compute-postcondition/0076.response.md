The code `break` is executed within a loop, which causes the loop to exit. The variables `checkMe`, `leftToCheck`, `neighbors`, `cliqueSize`, and `isGood` are not modified by this statement. Therefore, the only change is that the loop is broken.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`, `neighbor` is each element in `neighbors` during the loop execution, and `isGood` is `False`. We break out of the loop.**
