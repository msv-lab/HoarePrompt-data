The code `break` does not change any variable values. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement containing `break` in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `neighbor` is a node in the graph; the length of the list of neighbors of `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set.**
