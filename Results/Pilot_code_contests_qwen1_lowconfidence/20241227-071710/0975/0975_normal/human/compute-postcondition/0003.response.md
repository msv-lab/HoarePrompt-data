The code `graph[i + 1] = []` creates a new key in the dictionary `graph` with the key `i + 1` and assigns an empty list to it. Initially, `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1. The value of `n` and `m` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is an integer, `graph` is a dictionary containing the key 1 with the value [], and `i` is 0.**
