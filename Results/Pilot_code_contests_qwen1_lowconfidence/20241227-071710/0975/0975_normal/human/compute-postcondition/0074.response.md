The variable `isGood` is assigned the value `False`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`, `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element than before, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`, `neighbor` is each element in `neighbors` during the loop execution, and `isGood` is `False`.**
