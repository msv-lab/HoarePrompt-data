The code sets `isGood` to `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` is `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` excluding the current neighbor, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`**
