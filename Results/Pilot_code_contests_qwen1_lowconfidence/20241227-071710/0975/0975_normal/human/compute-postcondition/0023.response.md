The code initializes the variable `isGood` to `True`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is the number of edges added to the graph, `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of its neighbors, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m+1` to `n`, `isGood` is `True`.**
