The code `leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))` removes the set of `neighbors` from the `leftToCheck` set if it exists. Given the initial state, `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`, `isGood` remains `False`, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` (potentially excluding elements checked previously), and `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.

Since `leftToCheck` is initially an empty set, discarding any set from it will not change its state because there are no elements to remove.

Output State: **`leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`, `isGood` remains `False`, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` (potentially excluding elements checked previously), `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.**
