The print statement 'NO' does not affect the values of the variables. It only outputs text to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False` if not all nodes in the graph form cliques with their neighbors, otherwise `isGood` remains `True`, `graph` is the final state of the graph after checking all nodes, `checkMe` is the last node checked, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` after all checks, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.**
