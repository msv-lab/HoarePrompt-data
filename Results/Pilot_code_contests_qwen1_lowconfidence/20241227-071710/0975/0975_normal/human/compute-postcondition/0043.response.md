Postcondition: ***`graph` remains the same, `neighbor` changes to the next node in the list of neighbors, `isGood` remains `False`, and `leftToCheck` remains an empty set. If the length of the neighbors of the current `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, `isGood` remains `False` and `leftToCheck` remains an empty set.***
