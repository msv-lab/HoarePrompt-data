Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` is `False`, `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element, `checkMe` is the removed element from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` and is not an empty list, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`. The length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`***
