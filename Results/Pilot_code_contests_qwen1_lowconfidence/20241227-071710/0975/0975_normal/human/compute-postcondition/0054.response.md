The code `break` does not affect any variable's value; it simply breaks out of the current loop or the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` is `False`, `leftToCheck` is a set with no elements, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` and is not an empty list, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`**
