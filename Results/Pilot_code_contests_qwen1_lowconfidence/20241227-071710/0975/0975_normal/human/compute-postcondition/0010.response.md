`edge` is assigned the values read from standard input, split and converted to integers using `map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())`. This means `edge` will be an iterator of integers. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `graph` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n - 1`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) maps to an empty list, `edge` is an iterator of integers read from standard input.**
