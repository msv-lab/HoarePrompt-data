`leftToCheck` is a set that is not empty, and `checkMe` is assigned the value of an element popped from `leftToCheck`. The state of `leftToCheck` changes because an element has been removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`; `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element than before.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`; `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element than before.**
