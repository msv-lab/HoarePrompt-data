The code `graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` appends `edge[1]` to the list corresponding to the key `edge[0]` in the `graph` dictionary. 

Given the initial state:
- `total` is unspecified
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000]
- `m` must be greater than `n - 1`
- `graph` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) maps to an empty list

The code updates the `graph` dictionary by adding an edge between `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`. Since `edge` is an iterator of integers read from standard input, we don't know the exact values of `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`, but we can express the changes accordingly.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n - 1`, `graph` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) maps to a list, and `graph[edge[0]]` now contains `edge[1]` in its list.**
