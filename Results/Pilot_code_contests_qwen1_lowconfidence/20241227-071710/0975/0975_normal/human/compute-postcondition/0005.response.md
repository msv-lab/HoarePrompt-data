The code `graph[i + 1] = []` adds a new key to the dictionary `graph` with the key being `i + 1` (which is 2 since `i` is 1) and assigns it a list `[]`. The previous value of `i` is 1, which remains unchanged. All other variables (`n`, `m`, and the existing structure of `graph`) remain in their original states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is an integer, `graph` is a dictionary containing the keys 1 and 2 with values [], `i` is 1**
