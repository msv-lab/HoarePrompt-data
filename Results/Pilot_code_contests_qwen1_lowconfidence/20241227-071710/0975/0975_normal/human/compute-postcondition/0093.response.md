Postcondition: **`leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `False` if not all nodes in the graph form cliques with their neighbors, otherwise `isGood` remains `True`, `graph` is the final state of the graph after checking all nodes, `checkMe` is the last node checked, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` after all checks, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.**
