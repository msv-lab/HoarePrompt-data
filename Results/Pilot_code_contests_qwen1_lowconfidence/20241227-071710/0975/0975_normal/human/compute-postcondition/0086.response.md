The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the current block of code prematurely. The states of the variables `graph`, `cliqueSize`, `isGood`, and `leftToCheck` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` and `cliqueSize` are as they were before, `isGood` is False, `leftToCheck` is an empty set**
