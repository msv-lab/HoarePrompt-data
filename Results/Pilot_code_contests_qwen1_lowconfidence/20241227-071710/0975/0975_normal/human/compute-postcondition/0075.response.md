The code `leftToCheck = set([])` assigns an empty set to `leftToCheck`. This changes the value of `leftToCheck` from a set with one less element than before to an empty set. The other variables (`checkMe`, `neighbors`, `cliqueSize`, `neighbor`, and `isGood`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`, `neighbor` is each element in `neighbors` during the loop execution, and `isGood` is `False`.**
