The code `break` does not affect any variable values but indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` is `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` excluding the current neighbor, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
