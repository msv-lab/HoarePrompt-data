Output State: **`isGood` is either `True` or `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `neighbors`. If for any `neighbor`, the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, `isGood` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
- If the loop completes without finding any `neighbor` such that `len(graph[neighbor])` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, `isGood` remains `True`.
- Regardless of whether the loop executes or not, `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set after the loop, as the provided information indicates this happens when the loop executes even once.
- The values of `neighbors` and `cliqueSize` remain unchanged because the loop only checks the conditions based on these values and does not modify them.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `leftToCheck` was already empty), the values of `isGood`, `leftToCheck`, `neighbors`, and `cliqueSize` remain as they were initially.
