Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` remains `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` and is not an empty list, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`. If the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, then `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set. Otherwise, no changes occur to the other variables.***
