Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `graph` is a dictionary.
   - `isGood` remains `False`.
   - `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`.
   - `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`.
   - `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` and is not an empty list.
   - `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `neighbors`.

3. **Loop Body (Omitted):**
   - Within the loop, there is a condition that checks if the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.
   - If this condition is true, then `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set `{}`.
   - Otherwise, no changes occur to the other variables.

4. **Analysis for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `checkMe` needs to have at least one neighbor (`neighbors` should not be empty).
   - Since `neighbors` is explicitly mentioned as not being empty, we can proceed with this assumption.
   - `cliqueSize` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `graph` remains unchanged.
   - `isGood` remains `False`.
   - `leftToCheck` remains an empty set `{}`, as long as the condition inside the loop does not trigger.
   - `checkMe` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `neighbors` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration, but with the current `neighbor` being processed.
   - `cliqueSize` remains the same.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - If the condition inside the loop does not trigger, the states remain the same as the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` remains `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` (not empty), `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.**
