The code initializes `leftToCheck` to an empty set. This affects only the `leftToCheck` variable, which is now an empty set. The other variables (`graph`, `cliqueSize`, and `isGood`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` and `cliqueSize` are as they were before, `isGood` is False, `leftToCheck` is an empty set**
