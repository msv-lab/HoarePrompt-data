Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` remains `False`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set `{}`, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` (not empty), `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`. If the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
