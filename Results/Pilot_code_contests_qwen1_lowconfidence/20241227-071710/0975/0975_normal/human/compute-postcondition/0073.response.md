Postcondition: ***`checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`, `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element than before, `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `neighbors`, and `neighbor` is each element in `neighbors` during the loop execution. The length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`***
