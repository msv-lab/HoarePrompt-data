Postcondition: ***`leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is either `True` (indicating all nodes in the graph form cliques with their neighbors) or `False` (if not all nodes form cliques), `graph` is the final state of the graph after checking all nodes, `checkMe` is the last node checked, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` after all checks, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`. If `isGood` is `True`, printed to console: YES.***
