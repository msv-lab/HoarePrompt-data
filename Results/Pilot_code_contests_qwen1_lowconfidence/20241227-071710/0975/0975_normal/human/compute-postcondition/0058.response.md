The code `leftToCheck = set([])` sets the variable `leftToCheck` to an empty set. The previous value of `leftToCheck` was an empty set `{}`, which is now updated to `set([])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary, `isGood` is `False`, `leftToCheck` is `set([])`, `checkMe` is the removed element from the original `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` (not empty), `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`**
