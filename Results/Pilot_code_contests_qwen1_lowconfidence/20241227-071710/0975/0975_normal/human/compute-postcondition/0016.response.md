`graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])` appends `edge[0]` to the list `graph[edge[1]]`. Initially, `graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` has appended `edge[1]` to the list `graph[edge[0]]`. After this operation, `graph[edge[1]]` will now contain both `edge[0]` and `edge[1]`.

The states of the other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n`, `graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` has appended `edge[1]` to the list `graph[edge[0]]`, and `graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])` has appended `edge[0]` to the list `graph[edge[1]]`**.
