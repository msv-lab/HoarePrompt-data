Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000].
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `graph` is a dictionary containing the keys 1 and 2 with values [], i.e., `graph = {1: [], 2: []}`.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - After one iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.
   - Since `i` was 1 after the previous iteration and it is incremented to 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 2 and `n` must still be within its original range [3, 150,000].

5. **Adjusted States:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` remains within the range [3, 150,000].
   - `m` and `graph` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop condition.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is an integer, `graph` is a dictionary containing the keys 1 and 2 with values [], `i` is 2**
