The code `edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual elements, and maps them to integers. This operation affects the `edge` variable, but the initial state of the other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `m`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` must be greater than `n`, `edge` is a map object containing integers read from standard input**
