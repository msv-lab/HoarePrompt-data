`checkMe` is assigned the value of `leftToCheck.pop()`, which removes and returns an element from the `leftToCheck` set. Since `leftToCheck` contains integers from `m+1` to `n`, the value of `checkMe` will be one of these integers. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is the number of edges added to the graph, `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of its neighbors, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m+1` to `n` excluding `checkMe`, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is an integer in the range [m+1, n]**
