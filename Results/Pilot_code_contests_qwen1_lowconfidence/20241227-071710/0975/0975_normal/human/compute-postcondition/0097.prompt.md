You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, and m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2. The following m lines contain pairs of distinct integers (ai, bi) such that 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi, representing that members ai and bi are friends. No pair (ai, bi) repeats within the input.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {}
    for i in range(n):
        graph[i + 1] = []
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is an integer, `graph` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) maps to an empty list, and `i` is `n - 1`.
    for i in range(m):
        edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        
        graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        
        graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `m`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is the number of edges added to the graph, `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of its neighbors.
    leftToCheck = set([(i + 1) for i in range(n)])
    isGood = True
    while len(leftToCheck) > 0:
        checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()
        
        neighbors = graph[checkMe]
        
        cliqueSize = len(neighbors)
        
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize:
                isGood = False
                leftToCheck = set([])
                break
        
        leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is `True` if all nodes in the graph form cliques with their neighbors, otherwise `isGood` is `False`, `graph` is the final state of the graph after checking all nodes, `checkMe` is the last node checked, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` after all checks, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`.
    if isGood :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is either `True` (indicating all nodes in the graph form cliques with their neighbors) or `False` (if not all nodes form cliques), `graph` is the final state of the graph after checking all nodes, `checkMe` is the last node checked, `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` after all checks, `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors of `checkMe`. If `isGood` is `True`, printed to console: YES.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of friendship pairs among `n` members and returns a result based on these friendships.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
