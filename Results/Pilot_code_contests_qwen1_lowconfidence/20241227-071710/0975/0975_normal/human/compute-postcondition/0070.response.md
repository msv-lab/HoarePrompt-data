The code `neighbors = graph[checkMe]` assigns the value of the element in the dictionary `graph` at key `checkMe` to the variable `neighbors`. 

- `checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`.
- `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element than before.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`checkMe` is the value of the element popped from `leftToCheck`; `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element than before; `neighbors` is the value of `graph[checkMe]`**
