`cliqueSize` is assigned the value of `len(neighbors)`, which calculates the length of the list `neighbors`. This means `cliqueSize` will hold the number of neighbors that `checkMe` has in the graph. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `m`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is the number of edges added to the graph, `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of its neighbors, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m+1` to `n` excluding `checkMe`, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is an integer in the range [m+1, n], `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` in the graph, and `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors that `checkMe` has.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is the number of edges added to the graph, `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of its neighbors, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m+1` to `n` excluding `checkMe`, `isGood` is `True`, `checkMe` is an integer in the range [m+1, n], `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe` in the graph, and `cliqueSize` is the number of neighbors that `checkMe` has.**
