The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement we were inside. However, since no loop or if statement was specified in the context, the only thing we can conclude is that we exit the current loop or if statement.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `neighbor` is a node in the graph; the length of the list of neighbors of `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`; `isGood` is `False`; `leftToCheck` is an empty set; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
