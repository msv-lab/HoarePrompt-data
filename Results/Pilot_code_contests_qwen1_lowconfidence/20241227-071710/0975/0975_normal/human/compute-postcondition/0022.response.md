The code creates a set called `leftToCheck` which contains elements `(i + 1)` for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. Since `i` is initially `m`, the set will contain the integers from `m+1` to `n`.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is the number of edges added to the graph, `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of its neighbors, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from `m+1` to `n`.**
