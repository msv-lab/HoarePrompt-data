The code `neighbors = graph[checkMe]` assigns the list of neighbors of `checkMe` to the variable `neighbors`. This does not change the value of `isGood`, `leftToCheck`, or `checkMe`. It only updates `neighbors`.

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors; `isGood` is `False` if any neighbor's list of neighbors does not match `cliqueSize`, otherwise `isGood` is `True`; `leftToCheck` is a set with one less element, and `checkMe` is the value of the removed element from `leftToCheck`; `neighbors` is the list of neighbors of `checkMe`.**
