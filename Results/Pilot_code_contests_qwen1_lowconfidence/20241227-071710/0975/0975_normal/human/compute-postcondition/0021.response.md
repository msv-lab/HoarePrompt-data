Let's analyze the given loop step by step and determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000]
- `m` is an integer
- `graph` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` (inclusive) maps to an empty list
- `i` is `n - 1`

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(m):
    edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
    graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
```

### Analysis of the Loop
- The loop runs `m` times.
- Each iteration reads an edge from standard input and adds it to the adjacency lists of both nodes in the graph.

### Output State After All Iterations
After the loop completes all its iterations:
- The `i` variable will no longer be relevant since it was only initialized to `n - 1` before the loop starts and is not modified inside the loop. Therefore, `i` will be `m` when the loop finishes.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged because it is the number of iterations the loop performs.
- The `graph` dictionary will have edges added such that for each edge `(u, v)` read from input, both `graph[u].append(v)` and `graph[v].append(u)` are performed, making the graph undirected.

### Conclusion
The final state of the variables after the loop executes all its iterations is:
- `i` is `m`
- `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000]
- `m` is the number of edges added to the graph
- `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of its neighbors.

### Output State
Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is an integer within the range [3, 150,000], `m` is the number of edges added to the graph, `graph` is an undirected graph represented as a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of its neighbors.**
