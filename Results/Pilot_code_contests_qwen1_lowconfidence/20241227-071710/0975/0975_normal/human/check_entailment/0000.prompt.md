You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak examines a social network. Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).

There are n members, numbered 1 through n. m pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.

Let A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.

For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.

Can you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print "YES" or "NO" accordingly, without the quotes.

Input

The first line of the input contain two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, <image>) — the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.

The i-th of the next m lines contains two distinct integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi). Members ai and bi are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.

Output

If the given network is reasonable, print "YES" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" in a single line (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4


Output

YES


Input

4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2


Output

NO


Input

10 4
4 3
5 10
8 9
1 2


Output

YES


Input

3 2
1 2
2 3


Output

NO

Note

The drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right). Each edge represents two members that are friends. The answer is "NO" in the second sample because members (2, 3) are friends and members (3, 4) are friends, while members (2, 4) are not.

<image>
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {}
    for i in range(n):
        graph[i + 1] = []
    for i in range(m):
        edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
    leftToCheck = set([i + 1 for i in range(n)])
    isGood = True
    while len(leftToCheck) > 0:
        checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()
        neighbors = graph[checkMe]
        cliqueSize = len(neighbors)
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize:
                isGood = False
                leftToCheck = set([])
                break
        leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))
    if isGood:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
