Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the social network is reasonable according to the given problem description. Specifically, the approach used to check if the network is reasonable is flawed.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Approach to Checking Cliques:**
   - The program attempts to use a set `leftToCheck` to iterate over nodes and then check if their neighbors form a clique. However, this approach is overly complex and does not correctly ensure that the condition \( \text{if } X-Y \text{ and } Y-Z \text{ then } X-Z \) holds for all triplets \( (X, Y, Z) \).
   
2. **Misunderstanding of the Problem Condition:**
   - The problem requires checking for transitivity in the friendship relations, meaning if \( A \) is friends with \( B \) and \( B \) is friends with \( C \), then \( A \) must also be friends with \( C \). The current implementation does not properly enforce this condition.
   
3. **Inefficient and Incorrect Use of Sets:**
   - The code uses sets to keep track of nodes to check, but it incorrectly discards neighbors from `leftToCheck` without fully checking the condition for all nodes. This leads to incomplete and potentially incorrect verification.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly verify the condition, one should:
1. Parse the input to build an adjacency list representation of the graph.
2. Iterate over all pairs of friends and for each pair \( (A, B) \), check if \( A \) is friends with all friends of \( B \) except \( B \) itself.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {i: set() for i in range(1, n+1)}
    
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        graph[a].add(b)
        graph[b].add(a)
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in graph[i]:
            for k in graph[j]:
                if k != i and k not in graph[i]:
                    print('NO')
                    return
    print('YES')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Build an adjacency list representation of the graph using a dictionary where each key is a member and the value is a set of friends.
   
2. **Transitivity Check:**
   - For each member \( i \), and for each friend \( j \) of \( i \), check if \( i \) is friends with all friends of \( j \) (except \( j \) itself). If this condition fails for any triplet, print "NO" and exit. If no violations are found, print "YES".

This approach ensures that the transitivity condition is correctly verified for all possible triplets of members, adhering to the problem description.
