Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to check if the network is reasonable. Specifically, the code checks if all members form cliques with their neighbors, which is not the correct approach according to the problem description.

The problem description requires checking if for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z, then also X-Z. However, the code incorrectly assumes that if a member has the same number of neighbors as all of its neighbors, then the network is reasonable. This is not a sufficient condition.

Here is a counterexample where the code fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2
```

According to the problem description, this network should return "NO" because although member 3 has the same number of neighbors as its neighbors, member 2 does not have the same number of neighbors as member 1 and member 4.

However, the code would incorrectly return "YES" because it only checks if each member has the same number of neighbors as its neighbors, which does not guarantee the transitivity property required by the problem.

Thus, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
