Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the social network is reasonable according to the given problem description. Specifically, the approach taken in the program does not ensure that for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z, then also X-Z. 

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program correctly constructs an undirected graph using adjacency lists based on the input friendship pairs.

2. **Clique Check Logic**: The core issue lies in the way the program attempts to verify if the graph forms cliques:
   - The program iterates over each node (`checkMe`) and checks its neighbors to see if all of them have the same number of neighbors (i.e., `cliqueSize`).
   - This approach is flawed because it does not check the transitive closure of friendships, which is the critical requirement for the network to be considered reasonable.

3. **Transitive Closure Requirement**: The problem requires checking the transitive property of friendships. For instance, if member A is friends with member B, and member B is friends with member C, then member A must also be friends with member C. The program does not explicitly check this transitive relationship.

4. **Incorrect Approach**: Instead of checking the transitive closure directly, the program checks if each node's neighbors have the same number of connections. This approach is not sufficient to validate the transitive property. For example, consider the following friendship pairs:
   - Member 1 is friends with Member 2 and Member 3.
   - Member 2 is friends with Member 3 and Member 4.
   - Member 3 is friends with Member 4.

   According to the problem, Member 1 should also be friends with Member 4, but the current logic in the program would incorrectly conclude that the network is reasonable because all neighbors have the same number of connections.

5. **Example Counterexample**: Consider the input:
   ```
   4 3
   1 2
   2 3
   3 4
   ```
   The program would output "YES" because all neighbors have the same number of connections, but the network is actually not reasonable as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem requirements and hence is incorrect.
