You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak examines a social network. Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).

There are n members, numbered 1 through n. m pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.

Let A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.

For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.

Can you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print "YES" or "NO" accordingly, without the quotes.

Input

The first line of the input contain two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, <image>) — the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.

The i-th of the next m lines contains two distinct integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi). Members ai and bi are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.

Output

If the given network is reasonable, print "YES" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" in a single line (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4


Output

YES


Input

4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2


Output

NO


Input

10 4
4 3
5 10
8 9
1 2


Output

YES


Input

3 2
1 2
2 3


Output

NO

Note

The drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right). Each edge represents two members that are friends. The answer is "NO" in the second sample because members (2, 3) are friends and members (3, 4) are friends, while members (2, 4) are not.

Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {}
    for i in range(n):
        graph[i + 1] = []
    for i in range(m):
        edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
    leftToCheck = set([i + 1 for i in range(n)])
    isGood = True
    while len(leftToCheck) > 0:
        checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()
        neighbors = graph[checkMe]
        cliqueSize = len(neighbors)
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize:
                isGood = False
                leftToCheck = set([])
                break
        leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))
    if isGood:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the network is reasonable. Specifically, the program checks if all neighbors of a node have the same number of connections, which is not sufficient to verify the transitive property required by the problem. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4
```

This input should output "YES" because it satisfies the condition that if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z. However, the current implementation might fail to correctly identify this case due to its flawed logic.

A correct solution would involve checking all triplets (X, Y, Z) to ensure that if X-Y and Y-Z, then X-Z. The provided program does not perform this check. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a set of friendship pairs among \( n \) members and determines whether all members form cliques with their neighbors. It reads the number of members \( n \) and the number of friendship pairs \( m \) from standard input. It then constructs an undirected graph using adjacency lists. The function checks each member to ensure that every member has the same number of neighbors as all of its neighbors. If all members satisfy this condition, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles the case where no pair of friends repeats and ensures that the input constraints are respected. If any member does not form a clique with its neighbors, the function immediately breaks out of the loop and sets the result to 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
