Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the network is reasonable. Specifically, the program checks if all neighbors of a node have the same number of connections, which is not sufficient to verify the transitive property required by the problem. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4
```

This input should output "YES" because it satisfies the condition that if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z. However, the current implementation might fail to correctly identify this case due to its flawed logic.

A correct solution would involve checking all triplets (X, Y, Z) to ensure that if X-Y and Y-Z, then X-Z. The provided program does not perform this check. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
