Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the code checks whether every member forms a clique with its neighbors, which is not equivalent to checking the transitive property of friendship. The problem description requires that for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z, then X-Z. The code does not explicitly check this transitive property. Instead, it checks if every member has the same number of neighbors as all of its neighbors, which is not sufficient to determine if the network is reasonable.

Here is an example where the code fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4 3
1 2
2 3
1 3
```

In this case, members 1, 2, and 3 are all friends with each other, forming a triangle. The code would incorrectly print "YES" because each member has the same number of neighbors as all of its neighbors. However, the network is not reasonable according to the problem description because the transitive property is not satisfied for members (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3).

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality, and the correctness is **False**.
