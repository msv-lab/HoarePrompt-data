Precondition: **n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, and m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2. The following m lines contain pairs of distinct integers (ai, bi) such that 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi, representing that members ai and bi are friends. No pair (ai, bi) repeats within the input.**
