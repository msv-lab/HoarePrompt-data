You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You have n chains, the i-th chain consists of c_i vertices. Vertices in each chain are numbered independently from 1 to c_i along the chain. In other words, the i-th chain is the undirected graph with c_i vertices and (c_i - 1) edges connecting the j-th and the (j + 1)-th vertices for each 1 ≤ j < c_i.

Now you decided to unite chains in one graph in the following way: 

  1. the first chain is skipped; 
  2. the 1-st vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the a_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain; 
  3. the last (c_i-th) vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the b_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain. 

<image> Picture of the first test case. Dotted lines are the edges added during uniting process

Calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph.

A simple cycle is a chain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel along the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly once.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of chains you have.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of vertices in the corresponding chains.

The third line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_1 = -1; 1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

The fourth line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (b_1 = -1; 1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

Both a_1 and b_1 are equal to -1, they aren't used in graph building and given just for index consistency. It's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print the length of the longest simple cycle.

Note

In the first test case, the longest simple cycle is shown below: 

<image>

We can't increase it with the first chain, since in such case it won't be simple — the vertex 2 on the second chain will break simplicity.
Program:
```
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
```
