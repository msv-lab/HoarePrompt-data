According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 to allow another iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`**
