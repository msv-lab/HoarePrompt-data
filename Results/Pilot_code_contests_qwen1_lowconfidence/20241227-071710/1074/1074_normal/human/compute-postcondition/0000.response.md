The provided code snippet does not contain any executable statements that would modify the variables or perform any operations on them. It is merely a docstring explaining that the values will be printed to a stream or to `sys.stdout` by default. Since no changes are made to the variables, their states remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of chains. c is a list of n integers where each c_i is an integer such that 2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of vertices in each chain. a is a list of n integers where each a_i is an integer such that -1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i-1}, representing the vertex in the previous chain that connects to the first vertex of the current chain. b is a list of n integers where each b_i is an integer such that -1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i-1}, representing the vertex in the previous chain that connects to the last vertex of the current chain.**
