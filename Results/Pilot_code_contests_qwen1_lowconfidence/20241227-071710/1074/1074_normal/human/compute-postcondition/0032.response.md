The code sets `curr` to 1. This overrides the previous value of `curr`, which was `a[5] + c[4] - b[5] + 2`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `best`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` must be at least 2; `best` is the maximum value between its current value and `1 + c[4]`; `curr` is 1.**
