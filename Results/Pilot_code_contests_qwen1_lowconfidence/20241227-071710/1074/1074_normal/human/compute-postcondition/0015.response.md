`file.write(sep)` writes the content of `sep` to the file. This operation does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is False, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file**
