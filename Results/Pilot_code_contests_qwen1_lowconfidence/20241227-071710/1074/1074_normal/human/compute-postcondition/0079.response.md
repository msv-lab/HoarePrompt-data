`a[i]` is assigned the value of `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `b[i]` is assigned the value of `max(a[i], b[i])`. This means that `a[i]` will now be the smaller of the two original values, and `b[i]` will be the larger. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `best`, `curr`, `t`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `best` and `curr` are consistent with their respective definitions, `t` is greater than 1, `c` is a list of integers derived from the input.
