`best` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr + c[i]`. Given the initial state, `curr` is 1 and `i` is 4. Since `c` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `c[4]` is a valid element in the list `c`.

The code updates `best` to be the maximum of its current value and `1 + c[4]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be at least 2, `best` is the maximum value between its current value and `1 + c[4]`, and `curr` is 1.**
