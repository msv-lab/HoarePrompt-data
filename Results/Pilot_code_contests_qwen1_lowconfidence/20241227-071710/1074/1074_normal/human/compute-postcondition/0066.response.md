Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 5, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, `curr` is updated to either `curr + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)` or 1, depending on whether `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]` or not, `best` is now the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`**
