Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` is greater than 3
   - `i` is 5
   - `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`
   - `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`
   - `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`
   - `curr` is updated to either `curr + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)` or 1, depending on whether `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]` or not
   - `best` is now the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`

2. The code snippet updates `curr`:
   ```python
   curr += a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)
   ```

Since `i` is 5, `i + 1` is 6. This means `curr` is updated by adding `a[6]` and `(c[5] - b[6] + 1)` to `curr`.

3. The impact on the variables:
   - `n` remains greater than 3
   - `i` remains 5
   - `a[1]` remains `min(a[1], b[1])`
   - `b[1]` remains `max(a[1], b[1])`
   - `best` remains the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`
   - `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `a[6] + (c[5] - b[6] + 1)`
   - `best` remains the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[5]` (since `curr` just got updated and the next line involves `c[5]`)

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 5, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, `curr` is `curr + a[6] + (c[5] - b[6] + 1)`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[5]`**
