`curr` is updated by adding `a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `curr` is updated to `curr + a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`. The values of `best`, `i`, `n`, and `curr` before the operation remain unchanged.

Output State: **`best` is the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[3]`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `curr` is updated to `curr + a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`**
