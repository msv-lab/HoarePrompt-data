Postcondition: ***`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is False, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file. Since the if condition `not at_start` is always true given the precondition, the function simply writes `x` to the file with `sep` and does not change the state of `at_start`.***
