Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` is greater than 3
   - `i` is 4
   - `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`
   - `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`
   - `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + a[3] + (c[2] - b[3] + 1)`

2. Code Execution:
   - The code snippet `curr += a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)` updates `curr` by adding `a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)` to its current value.

Since `i` is 4, we have:
   - `i + 1` is 5, so `a[i + 1]` is `a[5]`
   - `c[i]` is `c[4]`
   - `b[i + 1]` is `b[5]`

Therefore, `curr` is updated to `curr + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)`.

3. Updated Values:
   - `n` remains greater than 3
   - `i` is now 5 (because `i` was incremented in the code)
   - `a[1]` remains `min(a[1], b[1])`
   - `b[1]` remains `max(a[1], b[1])`
   - `best` remains the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 5, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, `curr` is updated to `curr + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)`**
