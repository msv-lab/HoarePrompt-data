Postcondition: ***`best` is the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[3]`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `curr` is updated to `curr + a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1)`. If `a[4] == b[4]`, `curr` remains 1. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of the value of `i != n - 1`***.
