To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Variable `x`**: The variable `x` is used in the loop, and it iterates over the elements of `args`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` is a non-empty list. 

2. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `c` is a list of `n` integers where each \(2 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each \(-1 \leq a_i \leq c_{i-1}\).
   - `b` is a list of `n` integers where each \(-1 \leq b_i \leq c_{i-1}\).
   - `sep` is `' '` (a string).
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `args`, meaning the loop will execute as long as `args` is not empty.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `args` is a non-empty list for the loop to execute. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`) do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `args` is a non-empty list.

State: **`args` must be a non-empty list**
