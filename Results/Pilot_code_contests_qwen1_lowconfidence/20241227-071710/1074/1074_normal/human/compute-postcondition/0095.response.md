Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `best` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[1]`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is not equal to `n - 1`.
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + a[2] + (c[1] - b[2] + 1)`.
   - If `a[i + 1]` is equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `curr` is reset to 1. Otherwise, `curr` keeps its previous value.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1 = 3`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 3, the condition `i < n` depends on `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `best` remains unchanged because it is only updated inside the loop and we don't know the exact update at this point.
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `curr` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is 3). However, without knowing the specific values of `a[3]`, `b[3]`, and `c[1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `curr` but we know it will be updated according to the rules given.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

State: **`best` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[1]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `curr` is updated based on the new value of `i` (which is 3)**.
