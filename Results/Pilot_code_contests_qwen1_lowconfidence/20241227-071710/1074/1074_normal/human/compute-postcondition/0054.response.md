`curr` is incremented by `a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)`. Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`
- `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`
- `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`

After the code executes:
- The value of `curr` is updated to `curr + a[3] + (c[2] - b[3] + 1)`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`, `curr` is `curr + a[3] + (c[2] - b[3] + 1)`**
