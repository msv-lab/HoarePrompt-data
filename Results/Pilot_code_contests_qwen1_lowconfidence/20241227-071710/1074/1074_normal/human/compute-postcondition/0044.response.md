According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is set to the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `b[0]` is set to the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated states are as follows:
- `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is min(`a[0]`, `b[0]`), `b[0]` is max(`a[0]`, `b[0]`)**
