`best` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `a[i]` is the minimum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `b[i]` is the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `best` is `1`, `curr` is consistent with its definition, `t` is greater than 1, `c` is a list of integers derived from the input.
