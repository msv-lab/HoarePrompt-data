`x` is written to the file using `file.write(str(x))`. This operation does not change the value of `x`, `args`, `at_start`, `sep`, or `file`. The only change is that `x` is now written to the file as a string.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is False, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file**
