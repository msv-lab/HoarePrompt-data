Let's analyze the given code snippet and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `args` is a non-empty list
  - `at_start` is `False`
  - `sep` content is written to the file
  - `x` is converted to a string and written to the file

### Code Snippet:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `args` list.
2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `at_start` is `False`: This indicates that this is not the first element in the `args` list (since `at_start` would typically be used to handle the first element differently).
   - `sep` content is written to the file: This suggests that some separator or previous value has already been written to the file.
   - `x` is converted to a string and written to the file: This means that the current element `x` in the loop has been processed and written as a string to the file.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
- The `args` list must still be non-empty (since it was non-empty before the last iteration).
- Since `at_start` is `False`, it implies that we are processing elements from the `args` list sequentially, starting from the second element.
- We need to write another element from the `args` list to the file as a string, with an appropriate separator if necessary.

### Adjusted States:
- `args` remains a non-empty list because the loop needs to continue.
- `at_start` should remain `False` since we are not at the start of the list anymore.
- `sep` content might or might not be written to the file depending on the requirements, but we can assume it is still relevant for the next iteration.
- The next `x` in the list should be written to the file as a string.

### Final State:
State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is False, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file**

So, the state for the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is False, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file**
