`best` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, the code effectively updates `best` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[3]`. However, the specific values of `best`, `curr`, and `c[3]` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `best` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`best` is the maximum of its current value and `curr + c[3]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `curr` is updated based on the new value of `i` (which is 3)**
