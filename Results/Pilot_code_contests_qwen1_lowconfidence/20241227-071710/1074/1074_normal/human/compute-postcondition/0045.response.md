Given the initial state where `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`, and `b[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`, the code snippet updates `a[i]` and `b[i]` such that `a[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Since `i` is initially set to 1, the updated values of `a[1]` and `b[1]` will be determined by the minimum and maximum of `a[1]` and `b[1]` (which are both undefined in the initial state but will be calculated based on their respective definitions). Given the initial values of `a[0]` and `b[0]`:
- `a[0]` is the smaller of `a[0]` and `b[0]`
- `b[0]` is the larger of `a[0]` and `b[0]`

For `a[1]` and `b[1]`:
- `a[1]` will be the minimum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, which simplifies to the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`
- `b[1]` will be the maximum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, which simplifies to the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `a[1]` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`
- `b[1]` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is `min(a[0], b[0])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`**
