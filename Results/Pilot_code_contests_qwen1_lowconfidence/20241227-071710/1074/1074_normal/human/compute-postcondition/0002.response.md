The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where each c_i is an integer such that 2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i is an integer such that -1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i-1}, `b` is a list of n integers where each b_i is an integer such that -1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i-1}, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, and `at_start` is True.
