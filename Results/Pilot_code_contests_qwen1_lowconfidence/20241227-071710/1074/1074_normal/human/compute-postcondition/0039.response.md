The code `c = [int(ci) for ci in input().split()]` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list. This list is then assigned to the variable `c`. The initial state values of `best`, `curr`, `t`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`best` is the maximum value of `curr` + `c[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `curr` is either 1 if any `a[i+1] = b[i+1]` occurs, or the cumulative sum of `a[i+1] + (c[i] - b[i+1] + 1)` for the remaining values of `i`, and `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
