Initial State: 
- `n` is greater than 3
- `i` is 5
- `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`
- `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`
- `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`
- `curr` is 1
- `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[5]`

Code Snippet:
```python
curr = 1
```

Impact on Variables:
- The value of `curr` is explicitly set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 5, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, `curr` is 1, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[5]`**
