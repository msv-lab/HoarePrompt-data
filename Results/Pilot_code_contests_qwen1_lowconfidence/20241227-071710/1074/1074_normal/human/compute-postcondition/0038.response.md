The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. This operation affects only the variable `n`, while the values of `best`, `curr`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`best` is the maximum value of `curr` + `c[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `curr` is either 1 if any `a[i+1] = b[i+1]` occurs, or the cumulative sum of `a[i+1] + (c[i] - b[i+1] + 1)` for the remaining values of `i`, and `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer**
