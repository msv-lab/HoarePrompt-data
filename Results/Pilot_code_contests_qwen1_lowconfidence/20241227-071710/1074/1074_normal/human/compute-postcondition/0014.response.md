According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is `False`, the content of `sep` has been written to the file, and `x` is the next element in `args` that was converted to a string and written to the file.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element. Since `at_start` is `False`, it means we are not at the start of the list and have already processed at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` is still non-empty and adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is False, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file**
