Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 5, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, `curr` is updated to either 1 or `curr + a[6] + (c[5] - b[6] + 1)` depending on whether `a[6]` equals `b[6]` or not, and `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[5]`***
