The value of `curr` is updated to 1. The previous value of `curr` was `curr + 4`, but since the exact value of `curr` before this line was not specified, we can denote it as `curr_prev`. After the update, `curr_prev + 4 = 1`, which implies `curr_prev = -3`. The values of `best`, `i`, `n`, and `a[4]` and `b[4]` and `c[3]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`best` is updated to max(`best`, `curr_prev + a[4] + (c[3] - b[4] + 1))`, `i` is 4, `n` remains the same, `curr` is 1**
