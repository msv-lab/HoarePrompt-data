Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 3
   - `i` is either 4 or 5
   - `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`
   - `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`
   - `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`
   - `curr` is updated to either `curr + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)` or 1, depending on whether `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]` or not.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - Since `i` is either 4 or 5 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 5 or 6, respectively.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - If `i` was 4, then the next iteration will start with `i = 5`.
   - If `i` was 5, then the next iteration will start with `i = 6`.

5. **Update Other Variables:**
   - `a[1]` remains `min(a[1], b[1])`.
   - `b[1]` remains `max(a[1], b[1])`.
   - `best` remains the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`.
   - `curr` is updated based on the condition, but since we don't know the exact value of `a[6]` or `b[6]`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `curr`.

Given these points, we can summarize the state at the start of the next iteration as follows:

**State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 5, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, `curr` is updated to either `curr + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)` or 1, depending on whether `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]` or not.**
