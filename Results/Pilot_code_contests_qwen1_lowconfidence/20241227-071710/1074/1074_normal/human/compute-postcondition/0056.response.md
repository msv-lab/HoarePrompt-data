The variable `curr` is assigned the value `1`. This assignment directly updates the value of `curr` without affecting the values of other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`, `curr` is `1`, `a[3]` equals `b[3]`**
