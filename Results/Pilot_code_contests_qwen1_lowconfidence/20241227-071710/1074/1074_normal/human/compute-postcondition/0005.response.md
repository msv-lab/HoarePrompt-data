`file.write(sep)` writes the content of `sep` to the file. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `sep`. Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the only change is that `sep` is written to the file.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is False, `sep` content is written to the file**
