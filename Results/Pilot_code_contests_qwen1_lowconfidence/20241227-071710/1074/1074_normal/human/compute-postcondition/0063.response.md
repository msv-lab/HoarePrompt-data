Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 5, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[4]`, `curr` is updated to `curr + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)`. If `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]`, then `curr` is reset to 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains as `curr + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)`.***
