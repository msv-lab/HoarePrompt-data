The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. This operation does not change the value of any variables other than possibly advancing the write position in the file. The state of `args`, `at_start`, and `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is False, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file**
