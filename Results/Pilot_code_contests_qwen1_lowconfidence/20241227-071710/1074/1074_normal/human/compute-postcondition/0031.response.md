Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Initial State:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be at least 2 (unchanged)
   - `best` is the maximum value between its current value and `1 + c[4]` (unchanged until `c[4]` is known)
   - `curr` is 1

2. Code Snippet: `curr += a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)`
   - Here, `i` is 4, so `a[i + 1]` means `a[5]`.
   - Also, `c[i]` means `c[4]` and `b[i + 1]` means `b[5]`.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `curr` is updated by adding `a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1)` to its current value.
   - The updated value of `curr` is `1 + a[5] + (c[4] - b[5] + 1) = a[5] + c[4] - b[5] + 2`.

4. After executing the code, the updated state is:
   - `i` remains 4
   - `n` remains at least 2 (unchanged)
   - `best` remains unchanged unless `1 + c[4]` changes its value compared to the current `best` (unchanged until `c[4]` is known)
   - `curr` is now `a[5] + c[4] - b[5] + 2`

Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` must be at least 2; `best` is the maximum value between its current value and `1 + c[4]`; `curr` is `a[5] + c[4] - b[5] + 2`.**
