The code initializes the variable `best` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a[i]`, or `b[i]`. Therefore, the only change is in the variable `best`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])` and `b[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`, `best` is 1**
