The function `func_2(best)` is called, but the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. Since no changes are made to any of the variables within this function call, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`best` is the maximum value encountered during the loop, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `curr` is 1 if `a[n] == b[n]`, otherwise `curr` is the value it reached just before the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, `c` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` and `b` are lists of integers**
