The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer representing the number of chains.
- `c`: a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the number of vertices in the corresponding chain.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where each integer (except the first one which is -1) represents the vertex index of the first chain that is connected to the current chain.
- `b`: a list of `n` integers where each integer (except the first one which is -1) represents the vertex index of the last chain that is connected to the current chain.

Based on the provided conditions, the function will process these parameters but does not explicitly return anything from the given information. Therefore, we assume the function might perform some operations based on these inputs without returning any specific value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b`. It processes these parameters to handle `t` test cases involving `n` chains, where each chain has a specified number of vertices and connections to other chains.**
