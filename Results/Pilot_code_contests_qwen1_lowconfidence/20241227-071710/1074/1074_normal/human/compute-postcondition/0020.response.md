The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the program by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. However, there is no information about `kwargs` in the initial state, and the code does not directly affect the variables `args`, `at_start`, or `sep`. It only writes something to the file, which is not represented in the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a non-empty list
- `at_start` is `False`
- `sep` content is written to the file for all elements except the first one
- `x` is the last element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file

Since `kwargs` is not defined initially and there is no context about its content, we cannot determine what exactly will be written to the file. However, the code itself does not change the variables `args`, `at_start`, `sep`, or `x`.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` content is written to the file for all elements except the first one, `x` is the last element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file**
