Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- For each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])` and `b[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`.
- `best` is 1.
- `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n > 0`: This ensures that there are at least 1 iteration of the loop.
   - `a[i]` and `b[i]` are already initialized for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Specifically, `a[i]` is set to `min(a[i], b[i])` and `b[i]` is set to `max(a[i], b[i])`.
   - `best` is 1 (though this value will likely change within the loop).
   - `curr` is `b[1] - a[1] + 1`, which is a specific initialization based on the value at index 1.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i = 1` at the start of the loop.
   - We need to confirm that `n > 1` because the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`. If `n = 1`, the loop would not run since the condition `i < n` would fail immediately.
   - `a[1]` and `b[1]` should be correctly initialized according to the given conditions: `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])` and `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` must be 1 at the start of the loop.
- `a[1]` and `b[1]` should be correctly initialized according to the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`**
