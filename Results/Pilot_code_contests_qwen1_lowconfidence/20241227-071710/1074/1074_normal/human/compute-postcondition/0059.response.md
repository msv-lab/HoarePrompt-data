According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Let's analyze each state step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`.
   - `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`.
   - `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`.
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + a[3] + (c[2] - b[3] + 1)`.
   - If `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]`, then `curr` is set to 1.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` should be incremented to 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be 4.
- `n` must still be greater than 3.

The updated states are:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 4.
- `a[1]` remains `min(a[1], b[1])`.
- `b[1]` remains `max(a[1], b[1])`.
- `best` remains the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`.
- `curr` remains updated to `curr + a[3] + (c[2] - b[3] + 1)`.
- If `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]`, then `curr` remains set to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 4, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`, `curr` is updated to `curr + a[3] + (c[2] - b[3] + 1)`, if `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]`, then `curr` is set to 1.**
