Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 5, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`, and `curr` is updated to either 1 or `curr + a[i + 1] + (c[i - 1] - b[i + 1] + 1)` depending on whether `a[i + 1]` equals `b[i + 1]` or not, and `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`. If `i` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `best` is updated accordingly based on the new value of `curr` and `c[i]`.***
