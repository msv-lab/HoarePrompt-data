The code initializes a list `b` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. This operation does not affect the values of `best`, `curr`, `t`, `n`, `c`, or `a`. Therefore, the only change is in the newly defined list `b`.

Output State: **`best` is the maximum value of `curr` + `c[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `curr` is either 1 if any `a[i+1] = b[i+1]` occurs, or the cumulative sum of `a[i+1] + (c[i] - b[i+1] + 1)` for the remaining values of `i`, and `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
