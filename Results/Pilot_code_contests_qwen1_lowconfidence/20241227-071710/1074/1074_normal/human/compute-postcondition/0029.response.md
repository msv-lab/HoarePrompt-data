According to the given code and the conditions provided, we need to determine how the states change for the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `best` is the maximum value between its current value and `curr + c[2]`.
   - `curr` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, the loop condition `1 <= i < n` means that for the next iteration, `i` will become 4 (assuming `n` remains unchanged).

4. **Effect on `best` and `curr`:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the information provided, the value of `best` is updated only if `curr + c[2]` is greater than the current value of `best`.
   - The value of `curr` is explicitly set to 1 within the loop body if `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]` is true. However, since it does not affect `curr` in this case, `curr` remains 1.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `best` remains the maximum value between its current value and `curr + c[2]`.
   - `curr` remains 1.

### Final State for the Next Iteration:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be at least 2, `best` is the maximum value between its current value and `curr + c[2]`, and `curr` is 1.**
