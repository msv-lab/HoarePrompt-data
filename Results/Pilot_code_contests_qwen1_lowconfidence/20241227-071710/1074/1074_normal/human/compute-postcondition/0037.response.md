Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is controlled by the variable `t`. The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `best` is the maximum value of `curr` + `c[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - `curr` is either 1 if any `a[i+1] = b[i+1]` occurs, or the cumulative sum of `a[i+1] + (c[i] - b[i+1] + 1)` for the remaining values of `i`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to decrement `t` by 1 at the start of each iteration.

Given this, let's adjust the states:

- The value of `t` needs to be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
- `best` and `curr` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop itself but rather by the conditions within the loop body, which are not specified here.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`best` is the maximum value of `curr` + `c[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `curr` is either 1 if any `a[i+1] = b[i+1]` occurs, or the cumulative sum of `a[i+1] + (c[i] - b[i+1] + 1)` for the remaining values of `i`, and `t` is decreased by 1.**
