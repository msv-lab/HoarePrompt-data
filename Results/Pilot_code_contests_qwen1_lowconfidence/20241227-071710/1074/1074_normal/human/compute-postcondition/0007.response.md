`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `file.write` will write `str(x)` to the file, which means that `x` is converted to a string before being written. The other variables (`args`, `at_start`, and `sep`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is False, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is converted to a string and written to the file.**
