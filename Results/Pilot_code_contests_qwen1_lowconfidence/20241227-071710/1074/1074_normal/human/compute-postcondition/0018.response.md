`at_start` is set to `False`. The values of the other variables (`args`, `sep`, `x`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty list, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` content is written to the file, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string and written to the file**
