Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`.***

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, and `best` is the maximum of `best` and `curr + c[i]`.
- The if condition `if (i != n - 1):` implies that the current value of `i` is not equal to `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` would be at least 0, and given that `i` starts at 1, `i` will increment to 2 within the if block.
- Therefore, after entering the if condition, `i` becomes 2. The other variables retain their values as per the precondition.
