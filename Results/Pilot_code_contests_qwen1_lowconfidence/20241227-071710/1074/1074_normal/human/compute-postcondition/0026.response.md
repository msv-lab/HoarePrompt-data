The value of `curr` is updated to 1. The initial value of `curr` was `curr_initial + a[2] + (c[1] - b[2] + 1) + a[3] + (c[3] - b[3] + 1)`, but this expression is no longer relevant since `curr` is now explicitly set to 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `best`, `curr_initial`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `b[2]`, `b[3]`, `c[1]`, and `c[3]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `best` is the maximum value between its current value and `curr + c[2]`, `curr` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `best` is the maximum value between its current value and `curr + c[2]`, `curr` is 1**
