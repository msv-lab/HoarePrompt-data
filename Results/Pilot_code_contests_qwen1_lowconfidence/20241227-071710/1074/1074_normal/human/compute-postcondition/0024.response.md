The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it processes a series of test cases defined by the following inputs:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of chains.
  - `c` is a list of n integers where each `c_i` is an integer such that 2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of vertices in each chain.
  - `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` is an integer such that -1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i-1}, representing the vertex in the previous chain that connects to the first vertex of the current chain.
  - `b` is a list of n integers where each `b_i` is an integer such that -1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i-1}, representing the vertex in the previous chain that connects to the last vertex of the current chain.

Based on the inputs, the function processes multiple test cases and returns outputs for each test case as specified in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases defined by integers `t`, `n`, lists `c`, `a`, and `b`.**
