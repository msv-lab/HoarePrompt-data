Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `best` is the maximum value between its current value and `curr + c[2]`, and `curr` is 1. Since the if condition `a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]` does not affect the value of `curr` (which is explicitly set to 1 in the if part), the overall postcondition remains the same as the if part's postcondition.***
