Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `a[1]` is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `b[1]` is `max(a[1], b[1])`, `best` is the maximum of all `best` and `curr + c[j]` for `j` from 1 to `n-1`, `curr` is 1 if `a[n]` equals `b[n]`, otherwise `curr` is the sum of `a[i] + (c[i-1] - b[i] + 1)` for all valid `i` from 1 to `n-1`.**
