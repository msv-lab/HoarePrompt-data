t is an integer representing the number of test cases; n is an integer representing the number of chains; c is a list of n integers where each integer represents the number of vertices in the corresponding chain; a is a list of n integers where each integer (except the first one which is -1) represents the vertex index of the first chain that is connected to the current chain; b is a list of n integers where each integer (except the first one which is -1) represents the vertex index of the last chain that is connected to the current chain.
