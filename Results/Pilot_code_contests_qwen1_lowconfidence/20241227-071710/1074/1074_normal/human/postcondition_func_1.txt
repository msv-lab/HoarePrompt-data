This function processes a series of test cases defined by the parameters `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b`. It prints a series of values to a specified output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). The function iterates over the provided arguments, writing each element to the output stream separated by a specified separator (`sep`). The first element is not prefixed with the separator. After writing all elements, it appends the specified end character (defaulting to a newline). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, it flushes the output stream. However, the function does not accept any explicit parameters and instead processes these parameters as positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). This means that the function cannot be called directly with `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b` as parameters; instead, these values must be passed as part of the `args` and `kwargs` when calling the function.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes that `args` is always non-empty, which could lead to issues if an empty list is passed.
2. The function does not validate the types or values of the elements in `args`, `c`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The function does not handle cases where `sep` is not a string or `file` is not a valid writable stream.
4. The function does not account for the possibility that `end` might not be a string or `flush` might not be a boolean.
