Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` are equal within the same chain, which should reset the current cycle length calculation (`curr`) to 1. This oversight causes the program to potentially overestimate the length of the longest simple cycle.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
3
3 4 3
-1 1 2
-1 2 3
```

The expected output is 7, but the program incorrectly outputs 8. This happens because when `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` are equal, the current cycle length should be reset to 1, but the program does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.
