You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have n chains, the i-th chain consists of c_i vertices. Vertices in each chain are numbered independently from 1 to c_i along the chain. In other words, the i-th chain is the undirected graph with c_i vertices and (c_i - 1) edges connecting the j-th and the (j + 1)-th vertices for each 1 ≤ j < c_i.

Now you decided to unite chains in one graph in the following way: 

  1. the first chain is skipped; 
  2. the 1-st vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the a_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain; 
  3. the last (c_i-th) vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the b_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain. 

<image> Picture of the first test case. Dotted lines are the edges added during uniting process

Calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph.

A simple cycle is a chain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel along the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly once.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of chains you have.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of vertices in the corresponding chains.

The third line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_1 = -1; 1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

The fourth line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (b_1 = -1; 1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

Both a_1 and b_1 are equal to -1, they aren't used in graph building and given just for index consistency. It's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print the length of the longest simple cycle.

Example

Output

Note

In the first test case, the longest simple cycle is shown below:

We can't increase it with the first chain, since in such case it won't be simple — the vertex 2 on the second chain will break simplicity.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        c = [int(ci) for ci in input().split()]
        a = [int(ai) for ai in input().split()]
        b = [int(bi) for bi in input().split()]
        for i in range(n):
            (a[i], b[i]) = (min(a[i], b[i]), max(a[i], b[i]))
        best = 1
        curr = b[1] - a[1] + 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            best = max(best, curr + c[i])
            if i != n - 1:
                curr += a[i + 1] + (c[i] - b[i + 1] + 1)
                if a[i + 1] == b[i + 1]:
                    curr = 1
        func_2(best)

#Function 2:

    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the chains are connected in a way that allows for a longer cycle than what the current implementation considers.

Let's consider a test case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
-1 1 2 2
-1 2 2 3
```

According to the problem description, the chains should be connected as follows:
- Chain 1: 3 vertices (1, 2, 3)
- Chain 2: 4 vertices (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Chain 3: 3 vertices (1, 2, 3)
- Chain 4: 3 vertices (1, 2, 3)

The connections are:
- Chain 1 to Chain 2: Vertex 2 of Chain 1 connects to Vertex 1 of Chain 2, and Vertex 3 of Chain 1 connects to Vertex 2 of Chain 2.
- Chain 2 to Chain 3: Vertex 2 of Chain 2 connects to Vertex 2 of Chain 3, and Vertex 4 of Chain 2 connects to Vertex 2 of Chain 3.
- Chain 3 to Chain 4: Vertex 2 of Chain 3 connects to Vertex 2 of Chain 4, and Vertex 3 of Chain 3 connects to Vertex 2 of Chain 4.

The longest simple cycle in this configuration would include vertices from all four chains:
- Chain 1: 3 → 2 → 1
- Chain 2: 2 → 4 → 3
- Chain 3: 2 → 3
- Chain 4: 2 → 3

This forms a cycle of length 7:
- 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 1

However, the program calculates the longest cycle as 11, which is incorrect. The program sums up the lengths of the chains without properly accounting for the connections between them. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : This function processes a series of test cases defined by the parameters `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b`. It prints a series of values to a specified output stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). The function iterates over the provided arguments, writing each element to the output stream separated by a specified separator (`sep`). The first element is not prefixed with the separator. After writing all elements, it appends the specified end character (defaulting to a newline). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, it flushes the output stream. However, the function does not accept any explicit parameters and instead processes these parameters as positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). This means that the function cannot be called directly with `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, and `b` as parameters; instead, these values must be passed as part of the `args` and `kwargs` when calling the function.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes that `args` is always non-empty, which could lead to issues if an empty list is passed.
2. The function does not validate the types or values of the elements in `args`, `c`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The function does not handle cases where `sep` is not a string or `file` is not a valid writable stream.
4. The function does not account for the possibility that `end` might not be a string or `flush` might not be a boolean.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
