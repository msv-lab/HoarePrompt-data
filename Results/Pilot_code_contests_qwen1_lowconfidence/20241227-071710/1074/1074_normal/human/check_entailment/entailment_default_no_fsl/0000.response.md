Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph. Specifically, the code only considers the maximum possible length of a path through all chains and does not account for the constraints of forming a simple cycle. The variable `best` is updated to hold the maximum path length found, but it does not take into consideration the requirement that each vertex in the cycle must be visited exactly once and that the first and last vertices of the cycle are connected.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
3
4
3 4 3 3
-1 1 2 2
-1 2 2 3
```

According to the problem description, the longest simple cycle would be formed by connecting the chains in a way that maximizes the length while maintaining the simplicity constraint. The given code does not correctly handle this scenario.

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the current implementation is incorrect:
1. The code calculates the maximum possible path length without considering the constraints of forming a simple cycle.
2. The logic to update `curr` does not account for the fact that the first and last vertices of each chain must be connected in a way that forms a simple cycle.
3. The function `func_2` simply prints the value of `best` without any validation or further processing, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the code needs to:
1. Ensure that the connections between chains form a simple cycle.
2. Calculate the length of the longest simple cycle by considering the constraints of the problem.

Since the current implementation does not meet these requirements, the program is incorrect.
