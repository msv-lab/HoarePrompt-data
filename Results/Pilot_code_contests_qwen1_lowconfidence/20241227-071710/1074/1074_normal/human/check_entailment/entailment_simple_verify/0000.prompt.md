You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have n chains, the i-th chain consists of c_i vertices. Vertices in each chain are numbered independently from 1 to c_i along the chain. In other words, the i-th chain is the undirected graph with c_i vertices and (c_i - 1) edges connecting the j-th and the (j + 1)-th vertices for each 1 ≤ j < c_i.

Now you decided to unite chains in one graph in the following way: 

  1. the first chain is skipped; 
  2. the 1-st vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the a_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain; 
  3. the last (c_i-th) vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the b_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain. 

<image> Picture of the first test case. Dotted lines are the edges added during uniting process

Calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph.

A simple cycle is a chain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel along the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly once.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of chains you have.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (2 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) — the number of vertices in the corresponding chains.

The third line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_1 = -1; 1 ≤ a_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

The fourth line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (b_1 = -1; 1 ≤ b_i ≤ c_{i - 1}).

Both a_1 and b_1 are equal to -1, they aren't used in graph building and given just for index consistency. It's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print the length of the longest simple cycle.

Example

Input


3
4
3 4 3 3
-1 1 2 2
-1 2 2 3
2
5 6
-1 5
-1 1
3
3 5 2
-1 1 1
-1 3 5


Output


7
11
8

Note

In the first test case, the longest simple cycle is shown below: 

<image>

We can't increase it with the first chain, since in such case it won't be simple — the vertex 2 on the second chain will break simplicity.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` are equal within the same chain, which should reset the current cycle length calculation (`curr`) to 1. This oversight causes the program to potentially overestimate the length of the longest simple cycle.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
3
3 4 3
-1 1 2
-1 2 3
```

The expected output is 7, but the program incorrectly outputs 8. This happens because when `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` are equal, the current cycle length should be reset to 1, but the program does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
