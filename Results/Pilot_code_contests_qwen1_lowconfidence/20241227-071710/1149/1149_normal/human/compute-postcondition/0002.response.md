Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `x` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `xi` <= `n` for all 1 <= i <= `n`, and `xi` are distinct. If the Python version starts with '2', `range` is now `xrange` and `input` is now `raw_input`; otherwise, no changes are made to `range` and `input`.**
