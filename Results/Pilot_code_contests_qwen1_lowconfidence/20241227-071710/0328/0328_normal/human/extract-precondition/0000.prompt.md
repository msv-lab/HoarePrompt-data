You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Limak is a little polar bear. He loves connecting with other bears via social networks. He has n friends and his relation with the i-th of them is described by a unique integer ti. The bigger this value is, the better the friendship is. No two friends have the same value ti.

Spring is starting and the Winter sleep is over for bears. Limak has just woken up and logged in. All his friends still sleep and thus none of them is online. Some (maybe all) of them will appear online in the next hours, one at a time.

The system displays friends who are online. On the screen there is space to display at most k friends. If there are more than k friends online then the system displays only k best of them — those with biggest ti.

Your task is to handle queries of two types:

  * "1 id" — Friend id becomes online. It's guaranteed that he wasn't online before. 
  * "2 id" — Check whether friend id is displayed by the system. Print "YES" or "NO" in a separate line. 



Are you able to help Limak and answer all queries of the second type?

Input

The first line contains three integers n, k and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 150 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(6, n)) — the number of friends, the maximum number of displayed online friends and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 ≤ ti ≤ 109) where ti describes how good is Limak's relation with the i-th friend.

The i-th of the following q lines contains two integers typei and idi (1 ≤ typei ≤ 2, 1 ≤ idi ≤ n) — the i-th query. If typei = 1 then a friend idi becomes online. If typei = 2 then you should check whether a friend idi is displayed.

It's guaranteed that no two queries of the first type will have the same idi becuase one friend can't become online twice. Also, it's guaranteed that at least one query will be of the second type (typei = 2) so the output won't be empty.

Output

For each query of the second type print one line with the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if the given friend is displayed and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first sample, Limak has 4 friends who all sleep initially. At first, the system displays nobody because nobody is online. There are the following 8 queries:

  1. "1 3" — Friend 3 becomes online. 
  2. "2 4" — We should check if friend 4 is displayed. He isn't even online and thus we print "NO". 
  3. "2 3" — We should check if friend 3 is displayed. Right now he is the only friend online and the system displays him. We should print "YES". 
  4. "1 1" — Friend 1 becomes online. The system now displays both friend 1 and friend 3. 
  5. "1 2" — Friend 2 becomes online. There are 3 friends online now but we were given k = 2 so only two friends can be displayed. Limak has worse relation with friend 1 than with other two online friends (t1 < t2, t3) so friend 1 won't be displayed 
  6. "2 1" — Print "NO". 
  7. "2 2" — Print "YES". 
  8. "2 3" — Print "YES". 
Program:
```
def func_1(ind):
    global tree
    while ind != 1 and frendly[tree[ind]] < frendly[tree[ind // 2]]:
        (tree[ind], tree[ind // 2]) = (tree[ind // 2], tree[ind])
        ind //= 2
```
