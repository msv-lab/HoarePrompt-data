Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the tournament structure as described in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly determining the maximum power of 2 that is less than or equal to the number of participants in the current round. The logic in the main loop is also flawed.

1. **Incorrect Power Calculation**: The function `func_1` checks against a hardcoded list of powers of 2 (`potencias`). However, this list is fixed and does not dynamically adjust based on the input `n`. For instance, if `n` is 7, `func_1` would incorrectly return 4 instead of 8, which would affect the number of matches and consequently the number of bottles of water.

2. **Incorrect Match Counting**: The main loop logic adds `b * k` bottles of water for matches where `k` participants compete, and `k / 2` additional bottles for the direct pass participants. However, this logic does not correctly reflect the structure of the tournament. For example, if `n` is 7, the first round should have 4 matches (8 participants, 4 compete, 4 pass directly), but the program incorrectly handles this.

3. **Towel Calculation**: The towel calculation is also incorrect. The program initializes `to` to `p * n`, which is correct, but the subsequent logic for adding towels is not properly aligned with the tournament structure.

To correctly implement the solution, the program needs to dynamically calculate the number of matches and participants in each round based on the current number of participants, and ensure that the number of bottles and towels is accurately counted according to the rules of the tournament.
