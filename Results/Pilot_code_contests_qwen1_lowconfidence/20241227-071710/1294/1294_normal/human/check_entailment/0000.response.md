Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd and greater than 1 but less than 1024 correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1(x)` is supposed to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`. However, the implementation of `func_1(x)` uses a hardcoded list of powers of 2 up to 512, which means it cannot correctly determine the largest power of 2 for larger values of `n`.

For example, if `n` is 999, the function `func_1(999)` will incorrectly return 512 instead of 1024, leading to an incorrect calculation of the number of bottles needed for the tournament.

To fix this, the function `func_1(x)` should be implemented using logarithms or a more dynamic approach to find the largest power of 2 for any given `n`.
