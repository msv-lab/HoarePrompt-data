Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of bottles of water needed for the tournament. The issue lies in how the number of matches `k` is determined and the subsequent calculation of bottles.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to return the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. However, its implementation is flawed. It iterates through a predefined list of powers of 2 (`potencias`) and returns the appropriate value. This part is correct in terms of finding the largest power of 2.

2. **Calculation of Matches**: The logic for calculating the number of matches `k` is incorrect. In the Olympic system, if `n` is odd, one participant will automatically advance to the next round without playing a match. The current implementation does not account for this properly.

3. **Bottle Calculation**: The number of bottles is calculated as `b * k + k / 2` for each round. However, this does not correctly reflect the number of matches played. Each match requires `b + 1` bottles, and this should be summed up for all rounds.

To fix this, we need to adjust the logic to correctly determine the number of matches and ensure the bottle count is accurate. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, b, p) = map(int, input().split())

def num_matches(n):
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return (n - 1) // 2 + 1
    else:
        return n // 2

bo = 0
while n > 1:
    k = num_matches(n)
    bo += k * (b + 1)
    n = (n - 1) // 2 + 1

to = p * n
print(bo, to)
```

This version correctly handles the odd number of participants and calculates the number of matches and bottles accurately.
