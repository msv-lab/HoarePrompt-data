Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of participants `n` is odd. In the given implementation, the function `func_1(x)` always returns the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`, but the logic in the main part of the program does not account for the fact that when `n` is odd, `k` should be adjusted to ensure exactly half of the participants advance to the next round.

For example, consider the input `7 2 3`. According to the problem description:
- Round 1: There are 7 participants. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7 is 4. So, 4 participants compete, and 3 move directly to the next round.
- Round 2: There are 4 + 3 = 7 participants. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7 is again 4. So, 4 participants compete, and 3 move directly to the next round.
- Round 3: There are 4 + 3 = 7 participants. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7 is 4. So, 4 participants compete, and 3 move directly to the next round.
- Round 4: There are 4 + 3 = 7 participants. Since 7 is odd, only 3 participants compete, and 4 move directly to the next round.
- Round 5: There are 3 + 4 = 7 participants. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7 is 4. So, 4 participants compete, and 3 move directly to the next round.
- Round 6: There are 4 + 3 = 7 participants. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7 is 4. So, 4 participants compete, and 3 move directly to the next round.
