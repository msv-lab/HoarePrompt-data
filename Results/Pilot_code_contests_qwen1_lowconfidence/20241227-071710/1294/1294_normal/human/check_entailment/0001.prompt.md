You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A tennis tournament with n participants is running. The participants are playing by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.

The tournament takes place in the following way (below, m is the number of the participants of the current round):

  * let k be the maximal power of the number 2 such that k ≤ m, 
  * k participants compete in the current round and a half of them passes to the next round, the other m - k participants pass to the next round directly, 
  * when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes. 



Each match requires b bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for the judge. Besides p towels are given to each participant for the whole tournament.

Find the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.

Note that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete (one of them will win and the other will lose).

Input

The only line contains three integers n, b, p (1 ≤ n, b, p ≤ 500) — the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement.

Output

Print two integers x and y — the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament.

Examples

Input

5 2 3


Output

20 15


Input

8 2 4


Output

35 32

Note

In the first example will be three rounds:

  1. in the first round will be two matches and for each match 5 bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge), 
  2. in the second round will be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water, 
  3. in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water. 



So in total we need 20 bottles of water.

In the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.
Program:
```
(n, b, p) = map(int, raw_input().split())
potencias = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
(bo, to) = (0, p * n)
while n > 1:
    k = func_1(n)
    bo += b * k
    print(n, k, bo)
    n = n - k / 2
    bo += k / 2
    if k == 1:
        break
print(bo, to)

def func_1(x):
    for i in range(10):
        if potencias[i] > x:
            return potencias[i - 1]


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
