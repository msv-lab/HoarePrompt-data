Postcondition: ***`x`, `b`, `p`, and `i` remain as initial values (i.e., `x` is an integer with 1 ≤ x ≤ 500, `b` is an integer with 1 ≤ b ≤ 500, `p` is an integer with 1 ≤ p ≤ 500, `i` is 1), `potencias[1]` remains unchanged, and the program returns `potencias[0]` if `potencias[i] > x`, otherwise, it does not return anything.***
