Postcondition: ***`x`, `b`, and `p` remain integers within their respective ranges. If `potencias[i] > x`, the program returns `potencias[2]`. Otherwise, nothing is returned.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, ensuring that the variables `x`, `b`, and `p` retain their constraints and that the program's behavior is correctly described based on the condition of `potencias[i]` relative to `x`.
