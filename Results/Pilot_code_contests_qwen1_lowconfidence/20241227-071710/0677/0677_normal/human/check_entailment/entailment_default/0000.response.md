Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_5` calculates the shortest and secondary shortest distances from the initial attacked city to all other cities, but it does not ensure that these calculations are accurate for all scenarios. Here are a few issues:

1. **Handling Disconnected Graphs**: The code does not handle cases where the graph is disconnected. If there are cities that are not reachable from the initial attacked city, the distances to those cities will not be correctly calculated. This is a critical issue because the problem description specifies that the entire road system is connected, allowing travel between any two cities. However, the code does not validate or handle disconnected components.

2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not explicitly check for edge cases such as the graph having isolated nodes or cycles. While the DFS traversal implicitly handles some aspects of these cases, it does not guarantee that all edge cases are properly handled.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_5`**: The logic in `func_5` updates the distances based on specific conditions, which might not cover all possible scenarios. For instance, the condition `if heights1[u] + 1 == distances1[v]` might not always correctly reflect the shortest path, especially in complex graphs.

To ensure correctness, the code should include explicit checks for disconnected components and handle edge cases more robustly. Additionally, the logic in `func_5` should be verified to ensure it correctly calculates the shortest and secondary shortest distances for all cities in the graph.
