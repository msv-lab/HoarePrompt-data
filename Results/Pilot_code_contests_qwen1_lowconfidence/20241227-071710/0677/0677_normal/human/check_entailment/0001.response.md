Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the code does not handle the following aspects:

1. **Building the graph**: The code does not explicitly build the graph using the input edges. Instead, it references `adjacents_list`, which is never defined or initialized.
2. **Calculating the minimum time**: The code does not implement the necessary logic to calculate the minimum time required to visit all attacked cities. Functions like `func_1` to `func_6` do not appear to be relevant to solving the problem as stated.
3. **Teleportation and pathfinding**: The problem requires finding the optimal city for teleportation and the minimum time to visit all attacked cities. The code does not address these requirements.

Given these issues, the provided code cannot be considered correct for the given problem description. Therefore, the output is **False**.
