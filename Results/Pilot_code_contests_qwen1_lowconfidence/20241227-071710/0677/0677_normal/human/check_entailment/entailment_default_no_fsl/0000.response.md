Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not handle the case where the graph is disconnected. In the problem description, it is stated that the road system is such that one can go from any city to any other city. However, the code does not check for disconnection and assumes that the graph is connected. This can lead to incorrect results if the graph is indeed disconnected. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 2
1 3
2 3
2 3
```
In this case, the graph is disconnected. The code will incorrectly calculate the shortest path and the city from which Super M should teleport, leading to a wrong output.

To fix this, the code needs to check if the graph is connected before proceeding with the calculations. If the graph is disconnected, the code should output an appropriate message or handle the case accordingly.
