#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin is an input stream containing the problem input in the specified format, where the first line contains two integers n and m separated by a space, representing the number of cities and the number of cities being attacked, respectively. The following lines contain descriptions of the roads, and the last line contains m distinct integers representing the cities being attacked.
def func_1():

    #The program returns a map object containing two integers converted to int type, representing the number of cities and the number of cities being attacked, respectively
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads the first line of input from `stdin`, which should contain two integers separated by a space, representing the number of cities and the number of cities being attacked, respectively. It then converts these integers to type `int` using the `map()` function and returns a `map` object containing these two integers. This function does not handle any edge cases such as invalid input formats (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect number of integers). Therefore, it assumes that the input is always correctly formatted.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a graph represented by `adjacents_list` to find the number of attacked cities in the subtree rooted at each city and determine which cities are important based on the presence of attacked cities. Specifically, the function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the attacked cities, marking visited cities and updating the `count_attacked_cities_subtree` list. After the DFS, it backtracks to update the `count_attacked_cities_subtree` list for the parent nodes and sets the `important_cities` flag to `False` for cities where the subtree count is zero. The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `adjacents_list`, `numbers_of_attacked_cities`, `visited`, `pi`, `count_attacked_cities_subtree`, and `important_cities`, and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no cities are attacked, all cities are attacked, or the graph is disconnected. Missing functionality includes handling cases where the graph contains isolated nodes or cycles, although the provided code implicitly handles these through the DFS traversal.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `numbers_of_attacked_cities`, `adjacents_list`, `pi`, `heights1`, and `heights2`. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the parent of each city and records the introduction order of the cities. After the DFS, it updates the `heights1` and `heights2` dictionaries based on the height of the cities. Specifically, for each city `v` in the `numbers_of_attacked_cities`, it ensures that `heights2[pi[v]]` equals `heights1[v] + 1` if the height of `pi[v]` is less than the height of `v` plus 1, otherwise, `heights2[pi[v]]` remains unchanged. If no cities are attacked (`m == 0`), the function still initializes the `visited` list and the `stack`, but does not perform the DFS.

After all iterations of the loop, if for any `v` in `adjacents_list[s]`, `heights1[v] + 1` is greater than `distances1[s]`, then `distances1[s]` will be updated to `heights1[v] + 1` and `distances2[s]` will be set to `distances1[s]`. Otherwise, `distances1[s]` and `distances2[s]` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts parameters `s`, `adjacents_list`, `heights1`, `distances1`, and `distances2`. It updates the `distances1` and `distances2` lists based on the heights of adjacent cities. Specifically, for each adjacent city `v` of the starting city `s`, if the height of city `v` plus one is greater than the current shortest path distance to city `s` (`distances1[s]`), then `distances1[s]` is updated to this new value and `distances2[s]` is set to `distances1[s]`. If no such update occurs, `distances1[s]` and `distances2[s]` remain unchanged. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies the `distances1` and `distances2` lists in place. An edge case to consider is when `adjacents_list[s]` is empty, in which case no updates would occur.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a graph representing cities and their connections. It starts by marking one of the attacked cities as visited and initializing a stack with this city. It then iterates through the graph using a depth-first search (DFS) approach to determine the shortest and secondary shortest paths from the initial attacked city to all other reachable cities. For each city, it updates the shortest (`distances1`) and secondary shortest (`distances2`) distances based on the current city's parent and its own attributes. If a city's shortest path length matches a specific condition, it adjusts the secondary shortest path accordingly. After the loop completes, the function ensures that all reachable cities have been visited, their parents correctly set, and their shortest and secondary shortest distances accurately calculated. The function does not return any value but modifies the `pi`, `distances1`, and `distances2` lists in place. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no path exists between certain cities, and the function handles these by ensuring that unvisited cities are not processed further.

    return distance
    #`The program returns the dictionary distance where distance[u] for all u from 0 to n-1 represents the shortest path distance from city s to city u`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts an integer `s` (where 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `n`), representing the starting city for the breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate distances to all other cities, and a list of lists `adjacents_list`, where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road. The function returns a list `distance` of length `n`, where `distance[u]` for all `u` from 0 to `n-1` represents the shortest path distance from city `s` to city `u`. 

After the function concludes, the following will be true:
- The `distance` list will have been populated such that `distance[u]` is the shortest path distance from city `s` to city `u` for all `u` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The `q` deque will be empty.
- All `distance[u]` values that were initially set to -1 will have been updated to their correct shortest path distances.
- The `adjacents_list` will remain unchanged; only the `distance` list will be modified.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `s` is 0, the code will treat it as if `s` is 1, since the code assumes `s` to be between 1 and `n`. However, this might not be ideal for a real-world scenario where `s` could logically start from 0.
- The function does not handle the case where the graph is disconnected. If city `s` is not reachable from other cities, some `distance[u]` values will remain -1, which should be noted as an edge case.
