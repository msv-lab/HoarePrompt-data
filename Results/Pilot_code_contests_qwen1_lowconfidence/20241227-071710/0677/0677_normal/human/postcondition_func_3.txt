The function `func_4` accepts parameters `s`, `adjacents_list`, `heights1`, `distances1`, and `distances2`. It updates the `distances1` and `distances2` lists based on the heights of adjacent cities. Specifically, for each adjacent city `v` of the starting city `s`, if the height of city `v` plus one is greater than the current shortest path distance to city `s` (`distances1[s]`), then `distances1[s]` is updated to this new value and `distances2[s]` is set to `distances1[s]`. If no such update occurs, `distances1[s]` and `distances2[s]` remain unchanged. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies the `distances1` and `distances2` lists in place. An edge case to consider is when `adjacents_list[s]` is empty, in which case no updates would occur.
