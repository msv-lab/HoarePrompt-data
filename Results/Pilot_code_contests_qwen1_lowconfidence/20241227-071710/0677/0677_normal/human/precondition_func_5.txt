s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ n, representing the starting city for the breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate distances to all other cities. adjacents_list is a list of lists where adjacents_list[i] contains all cities directly connected to city i by a road. n is the total number of cities in Byteforces, and is equal to the length of adjacents_list.
