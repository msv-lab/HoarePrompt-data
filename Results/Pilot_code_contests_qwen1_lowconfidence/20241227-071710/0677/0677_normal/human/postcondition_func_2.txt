The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `numbers_of_attacked_cities`, `adjacents_list`, `pi`, `heights1`, and `heights2`. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the parent of each city and records the introduction order of the cities. After the DFS, it updates the `heights1` and `heights2` dictionaries based on the height of the cities. Specifically, for each city `v` in the `numbers_of_attacked_cities`, it ensures that `heights2[pi[v]]` equals `heights1[v] + 1` if the height of `pi[v]` is less than the height of `v` plus 1, otherwise, `heights2[pi[v]]` remains unchanged. If no cities are attacked (`m == 0`), the function still initializes the `visited` list and the `stack`, but does not perform the DFS.
