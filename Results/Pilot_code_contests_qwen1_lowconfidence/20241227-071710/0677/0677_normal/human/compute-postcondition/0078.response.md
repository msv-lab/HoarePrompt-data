Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, and if `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, then `distances2[u]` is `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`; otherwise, `distances2[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.***
