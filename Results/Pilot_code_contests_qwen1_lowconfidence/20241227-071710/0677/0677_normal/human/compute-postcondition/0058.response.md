The code updates the value of `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`. Let's go through the changes step by step:

- Initially, `distances2[u]` is set to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`.
- After executing `distances2[u] = heights1[u]`, the value of `distances2[u]` is now directly `heights1[u]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `pi` is a dictionary with key `u` mapped to value `v`.
- `visited` is a dictionary with key `u` mapped to value `True`.
- `determinate` remains `False` unless `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, in which case it becomes `True`.
- `stack` contains `u` (plus any other elements that were already in the stack).
- `distances1[u]` remains `distances1[v] + 1`.
- `distances2[u]` is now `heights1[u]`.

Output State: **`pi` is a dictionary with key `u` mapped to value `v`; `visited` is a dictionary with key `u` mapped to value `True`; `determinate` remains `False` unless `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, in which case it becomes `True`; `stack` contains `u` (plus any other elements that were already in the stack); `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`; `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.**
