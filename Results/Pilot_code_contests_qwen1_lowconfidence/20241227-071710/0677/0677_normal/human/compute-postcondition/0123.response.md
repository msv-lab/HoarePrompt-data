The code assigns the value of `v` to `pi[u]`. This means that `u` is now associated with `v` as its predecessor in some path or tree structure. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 but less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is an unvisited node, and `visited[u]` is currently False; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`**
