`distances2[u]` is assigned the value of `heights1[u]`. According to the initial state, `heights1[u]` is updated, so `distances2[u]` will take the value of `heights1[u]`.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, `heights1[u]` and `heights2[u]` are updated, and the stack now contains `u`.**
