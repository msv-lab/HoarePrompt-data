According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `adjacents_list[v]`. The condition for the loop to continue is that there must be at least one element left in `adjacents_list[v]` that hasn't been visited yet.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `len(stack)` is at least 1.
- `pi[u]` is `v`.
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element.
- `visited[u]` is `True`.
- `determinate` remains `False`.

The loop body updates `distances2[u]` and `distances1[u]` based on the value of `visited[u]`.

To proceed to the next iteration, the current element `u` being processed must meet the following conditions:
- `visited[u]` must be `True` (since if it were `False`, the update would have occurred).
- There must be another element `w` in `adjacents_list[v]` such that `visited[w]` is `False` (to ensure the loop can continue).

Given that `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element and `visited[u]` is `True`, it means there is at least one other element in `adjacents_list[v]` that is not visited yet.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop can continue with an unvisited adjacent node.

State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` remains `False`.**
