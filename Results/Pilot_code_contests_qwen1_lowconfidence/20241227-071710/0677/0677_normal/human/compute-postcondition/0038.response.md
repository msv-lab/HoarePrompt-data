According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `adjacents_list[v]`. For the loop to execute, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `v` represents the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`.
2. The queue `q` has its first element removed, meaning `v` is the first element that was removed from the queue.
3. The loop iterates over the elements in `adjacents_list[v]`, so `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.

State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element**
