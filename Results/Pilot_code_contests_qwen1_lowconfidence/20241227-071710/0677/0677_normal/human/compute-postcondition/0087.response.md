`pi[u]` is assigned the value `v`. This updates the value of `pi[u]` from its previous state. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` remains `False`, and `distances2[u]` is updated based on the conditions provided.**
