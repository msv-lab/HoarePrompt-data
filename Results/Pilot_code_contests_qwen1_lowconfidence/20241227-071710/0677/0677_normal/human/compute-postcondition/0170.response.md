Postcondition: ***`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated. The stack now contains `u`. If `heights1[u] + 1 == distances1[v]`, then `distances2[u]` is updated to \(\max(\text{distances2[v]} + 1, \text{heights2[u]})\) or \(\text{heights1[u]}\), and `distances1[u]` is updated to \(\max(\text{heights1[u]}, \text{distances2[v]} + 1)\).***
