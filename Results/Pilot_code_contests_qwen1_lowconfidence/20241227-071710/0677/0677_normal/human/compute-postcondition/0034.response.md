Postcondition: ***`v` is the next element in `adjacents_list[v]` that satisfies the condition (`distance[u]` is `-1`); `q` includes the newly added `u`; `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`.*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not present, the postcondition of the if part directly serves as the overall postcondition. The condition `distance[u] == -1` is checked, and if true, `v` becomes the next element in `adjacents_list[v]` that satisfies the condition, `q` includes the newly added `u`, and `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`.
