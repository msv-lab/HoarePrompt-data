`pi[u]` is assigned the value of `v`. This means that the predecessor of node `u` in the path is now `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is unchanged, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated, and the next `u` to be processed is the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`**
