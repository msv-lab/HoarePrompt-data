The variable `determinate` is set to `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated, the stack now contains `u`, and the next `u` to be processed is the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`.**
