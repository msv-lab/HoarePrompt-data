The code updates `distances2[u]` to be equal to `heights1[u]`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

- `len(stack)` remains at least 2.
- `pi[u]` remains `v`.
- `adjacents_list[v]` still contains at least one remaining unvisited element.
- `visited[u]` remains `True`.
- `determinate` remains `True`.

The only change is in `distances2[u]`, which is now set to `heights1[u]`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`; `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
