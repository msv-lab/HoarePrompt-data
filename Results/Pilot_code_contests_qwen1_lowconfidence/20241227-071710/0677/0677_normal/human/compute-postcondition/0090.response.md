The code `stack.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `stack`. This changes the state of `stack` but does not affect the values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, and `distances2[u]` is updated based on the conditions provided.**
