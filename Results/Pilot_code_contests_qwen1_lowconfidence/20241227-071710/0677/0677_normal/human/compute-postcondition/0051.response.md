Output State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed and now contains all nodes that are adjacent to the last removed node, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and for every node `u` added to `q`, the distance of node `u` is set to `distance[v] + 1` if `distance[u]` was initially `-1`. If the loop does not execute, `q` remains unchanged with its first element being the element removed from the left side of the queue.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the adjacent nodes of the current node (`v`), updating the distance of each unvisited node (`u`) to be `distance[v] + 1`.
- After the loop completes, `q` will contain all nodes that are reachable from the starting node (initially `v`), and their distances will be correctly updated based on the shortest path from the start node.
- If the loop does not execute, `q` remains unchanged with its first element being the element removed from the left side of the queue, indicating that no further nodes were added to the queue.
