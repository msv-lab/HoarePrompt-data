The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `s`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `n`, representing the starting city for the breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate distances to all other cities. It also accepts `adjacents_list`, a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road. The parameter `n` is the total number of cities in Byteforces and is equal to the length of `adjacents_list`.

Case_1: The function returns a dictionary `distance` where `distance[u]` for all `u` from 0 to `n-1` represents the shortest path distance from city `s` to city `u`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept an integer `s` and a list of lists `adjacents_list`, and return a dictionary where each key `u` (ranging from 0 to `n-1`) represents the shortest path distance from city `s` to city `u`.
