The code `visited[u] = True` changes the value of `visited[u]` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `visited[u]`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` remains `False`.**
