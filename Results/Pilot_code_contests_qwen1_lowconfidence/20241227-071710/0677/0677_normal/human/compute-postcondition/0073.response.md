The code updates `distances1[u]` to the maximum value between `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given the precondition that `heights1[u]` is exactly `distances1[v] - 1` and `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`, we can calculate the new value of `distances1[u]`.

Since `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, let's denote `distances1[v]` as `D_v`. So `heights1[u]` is `D_v - 1`. Also, since `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`, let's denote `distances2[v]` as `D_2v`. So `D_v - 1 + 1` (which is `D_v`) is greater than `D_2v`.

The updated value of `distances1[u]` will be:
- `max(D_v - 1, D_2v + 1)`

Given `D_v - 1 + 1 > D_2v`, it means `D_v > D_2v`. Therefore, `max(D_v - 1, D_2v + 1)` will be `D_v - 1` because `D_v - 1` is greater than `D_2v + 1`.

So, the new value of `distances1[u]` will be `distances1[v] - 1`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, and `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.**
