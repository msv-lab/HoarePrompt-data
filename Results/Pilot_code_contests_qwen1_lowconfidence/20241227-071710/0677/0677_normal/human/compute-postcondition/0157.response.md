Postcondition: ***`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` remains `True`. If `not determinate` is true, then `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1` and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`. Otherwise, either `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` and `distances2[u]` is set to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`, or `distances1[u]` does not equal `heights1[u]` and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`.***
