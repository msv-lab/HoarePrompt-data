Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` remains `False`. Additionally, `distances2[u]` is either `heights1[u]` or `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, and `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after executing the if-else block, considering both the if part and the absence of an else part.
