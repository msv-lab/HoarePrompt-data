Postcondition: ***`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` remains `True`, `distances1[u]` is either `distances1[v] + 1` or `\max(\text{heights1[u]}, \text{distances2[v]} + 1)\`, and `distances2[u]` is either `\max(\text{distances2[v]} + 1, \text{heights2[u]})\` or `heights1[u]\`. The stack now contains `u`.***
