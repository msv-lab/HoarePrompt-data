The code updates the value of `distance[u]` to `distance[v] + 1`. The previous state is known, where `v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is now the queue without its leftmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is now equal to `distance[v] + 1`, and `q` now includes `u` as its new rightmost element.

After executing the line `distance[u] = distance[v] + 1`, the value of `distance[u]` is updated to `distance[v] + 1`.

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is now the queue without its leftmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is now equal to `distance[v] + 1`, and `q` now includes `u` as its new rightmost element; `distance[u]` is updated to `distance[v] + 1`**
