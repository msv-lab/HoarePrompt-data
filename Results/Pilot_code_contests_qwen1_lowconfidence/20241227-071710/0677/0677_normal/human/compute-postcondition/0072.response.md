The code sets `determinate` to `True`. This changes the value of `determinate` from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, and the current value of `heights1[u]` is exactly `distances1[v] - 1`. Additionally, `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`.**
