`u` is pushed onto the `stack`. The `visited[u]` remains `True`, and `determinate` remains `False`. The output state is: `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, and `stack` contains `u`.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `stack` contains `u`**
