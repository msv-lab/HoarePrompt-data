The code initializes a list called `distance` where each element is set to `-1`. This list has a length equal to `n`, which is the total number of cities. The value `-1` is used to indicate that the distance from the starting city (`s`) to these cities has not yet been determined.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is an integer such that `1 ≤ s ≤ n`, representing the starting city for the BFS.
- `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road.
- `n` is the total number of cities in Byteforces, and is equal to the length of `adjacents_list`.

After executing the line of code:
- `distance` is initialized to a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that `1 ≤ s ≤ n`, representing the starting city for the BFS; `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road; `n` is the total number of cities in Byteforces, and is equal to the length of `adjacents_list`; `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.**
