The code `q.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the end of the queue `q`. This operation does not affect the value of `v`, `adjacents_list[v]`, or `distance[u]`.

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is now the queue without its leftmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is now equal to `distance[v] + 1`, `q` now includes `u` as its new rightmost element.**
