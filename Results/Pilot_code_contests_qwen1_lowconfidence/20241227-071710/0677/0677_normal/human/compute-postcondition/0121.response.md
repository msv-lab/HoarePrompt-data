State before the loop starts: According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `adjacents_list`, `v`, and `u`. The loop will only execute if there are adjacent elements for the vertex `v` in the `adjacents_list`.

Before the loop starts, we know that:
- `len(stack)` is greater than 0 but less by 1, meaning `stack` had at least one element, and that element has been popped.
- `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`.

For the loop to execute, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 but less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element**
