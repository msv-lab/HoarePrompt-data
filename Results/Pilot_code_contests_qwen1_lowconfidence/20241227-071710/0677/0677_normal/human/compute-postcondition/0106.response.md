The code `stack.append(u)` adds the value of `u` to the end of the `stack`. Given the initial state, the length of `stack` was at least 1, meaning `stack` contained at least one element before this line of code. After appending `u`, the length of `stack` increases by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `False`.**
