The code updates `distances1[u]` to `distances1[v] + 1`. According to the initial state, `distances1[v]` is either `max(distances2[u] + 1, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]` based on the condition `distances1[u] == heights1[u]` and `distances2[u] == heights2[u]`. 

Since `distances1[u] == heights1[u]` and `distances2[u] == heights2[u]` are both true, `distances1[v]` is `max(distances2[u] + 1, heights2[u])`.

Let's denote `distances2[u]` as `d2u` and `heights2[u]` as `h2u`. Therefore, `distances1[v]` is `max(d2u + 1, h2u)`. Now, `distances1[u]` is updated to this value.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`; `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`, which is `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` given the initial conditions, and `distances2[u]` remains as `heights1[u]`.**
