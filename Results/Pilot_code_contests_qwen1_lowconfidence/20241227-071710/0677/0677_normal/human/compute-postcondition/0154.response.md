Postcondition: ***`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, and `stack` contains `u`. If `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, then either `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` and `distances2[u]` is set to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`, or `distances1[u]` does not equal `heights1[u]` and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`. In both cases, `determinate` remains `True`.***
