Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is in `stack`, `visited[u]` is currently True; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`; `determinate` is `False`. The current value of `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1`.***
