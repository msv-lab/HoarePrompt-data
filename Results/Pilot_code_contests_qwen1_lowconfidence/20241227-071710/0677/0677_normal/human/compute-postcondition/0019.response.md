Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must have contained elements for the loop to execute, and for every `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, `distance[u]` is now set to `distance[v] + 1` and `u` is appended to `q`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the adjacent nodes of the node `v` which was just dequeued from the queue `q`.
- For each adjacent node `u` whose distance is initially `-1`, the distance is updated to `distance[v] + 1` and `u` is appended to the queue `q`.
- After the loop finishes executing, `v` is removed from `q`, and for all `u` that were added to `q`, their distances are correctly updated based on the distance of `v`.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `q` is empty), then:
- `v` would not be the leftmost element of `q` since `q` is empty.
- `q` would be an empty queue.
- No nodes would be processed, so `adjacents_list[v]` could have contained no elements, and `distance[u]` would remain `-1` for any `u` that would have been in `adjacents_list[v]`.
