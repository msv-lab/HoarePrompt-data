The function `func_5` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer representing the number of cities.
- `m`: an integer representing the number of cities being attacked.
- `adjacents_list`: a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` is a list of cities adjacent to city `i`.
- `numbers_of_attacked_cities`: a list of `m` distinct integers representing the cities being attacked.
- `visited`: a list of boolean values indicating whether a city has been visited or not.
- `pi`: a dictionary mapping each city to its parent city in the tree.
- `heights1`: a list representing the height of each city in the first subtree.
- `heights2`: a list representing the height of each city in the second subtree.
- `distances1`: a list representing the minimum distance to be calculated in the first context.
- `distances2`: a list representing the minimum distance to be calculated in the second context.

The function may return different values based on the given conditions, but the specific return values are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `adjacents_list`, `numbers_of_attacked_cities`, `visited`, `pi`, `heights1`, `heights2`, `distances1`, and `distances2`.**
