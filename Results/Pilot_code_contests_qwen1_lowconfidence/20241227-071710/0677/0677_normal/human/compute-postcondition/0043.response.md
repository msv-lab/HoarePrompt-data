According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `u` and the list `adjacents_list[v]`. The loop will execute if `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:

- `v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`.
- `q` is the queue with its first element removed and now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements.
- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and the distance of node `u` is now set to 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `adjacents_list[v]` must still contain at least one element, and `u` must be one of the elements in `adjacents_list[v]`.

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect the updated values of `v` and `u`.

State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed and now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and the distance of node `u` is set to 0.**
