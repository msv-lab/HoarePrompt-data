Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains all its elements, `visited[u]` is `True` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, `determinate` remains `False` for all iterations, `distances1[u]` is the distance from the starting node to `u`, `distances2[u]` is the alternative distance to `u` considering heights, `heights1[u]` and `heights2[u]` remain their original values, and `stack` contains all nodes that were pushed during the loop iterations.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `len(stack) > 0`: This means the loop can start.
   - `v` is the initial popped value from `stack`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`:
     - `pi[u] = v`: Each `u` is marked as being reached from `v`.
     - `visited[u] = True`: Each `u` is marked as visited.
     - `determinate = False`: The `determinate` flag is set to `False` for each iteration of the loop, meaning the conditions for `determinate` being `True` were not met.
     - `stack.append(u)`: Each `u` is pushed onto the stack, ensuring all reachable nodes are processed.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - `distances1[u]`: This is updated based on the distance from the starting node to `u`. It is influenced by the previous value of `distances1[v]` and `heights1[u]`.
   - `distances2[u]`: This is updated based on the alternative path considering heights. If `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, `distances2[u]` is adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`.

4. **Final State**:
   - By the end of all iterations, `pi[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` will reflect the path taken to reach `u` from the starting node.
   - `visited[u]` will be `True` for all nodes that are reachable from the starting node.
   - `determinate` will remain `False` indicating that no specific conditions for `determinate` being `True` were met.
   - `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` will hold the calculated distances from the starting node to `u`, considering the given rules.
   - `heights1[u]` and `heights2[u]` will retain their original values since they are not modified within the loop.

This ensures that all reachable nodes are processed and the necessary distances are calculated according to the given logic.
