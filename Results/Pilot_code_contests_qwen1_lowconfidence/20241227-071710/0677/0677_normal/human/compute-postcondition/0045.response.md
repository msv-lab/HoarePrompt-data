`q` appends the value `u` to itself, meaning `u` is added to the right side of the queue. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and the distance of node `u` is set to `distance[v] + 1`.**
