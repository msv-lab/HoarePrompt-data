Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed.
   - `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed.
   - If `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, then `u` is added to `q`, `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`, and `adjacents_list[v]` must still have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`.
   - Otherwise, `q` remains unchanged.

2. **Current Variables:**
   - `v`: The element that was just removed from `q`.
   - `q`: The updated queue without its leftmost element.
   - `adjacents_list[v]`: The list of adjacent elements of `v`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`.

4. **Loop Body:**
   - For each `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`, the loop body is executed (not specified here).

5. **Determining the Next State:**
   - To determine the next state, we need to consider what happens if the loop continues for another iteration.
   - If `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, then `u` is added to `q`, `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`, and `adjacents_list[v]` must still have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`.
   - Otherwise, `q` remains unchanged.

6. **Next State Analysis:**
   - If `adjacents_list[v]` still has at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`, then one of those elements will be the next `u` to be processed in the loop.
   - Therefore, `v` will be replaced by the next element in `adjacents_list[v]` that meets the condition (`distance[u]` is `-1`), and `u` will be the new value of `v` for the next iteration.
   - `q` will be updated by adding this new `u` to it, and `distance[u]` will be set to `distance[v] + 1`.

7. **Final State:**
   - After the next iteration, `v` will be the next element in `adjacents_list[v]` that satisfies the condition.
   - `q` will include the newly added `u`.
   - `distance[u]` will be set to `distance[v] + 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `v` will be the next element in `adjacents_list[v]` that satisfies the condition (`distance[u]` is `-1`).
- `q` will include the newly added `u`.
- `distance[u]` will be set to `distance[v] + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of the next element in `adjacents_list[v]` that satisfies the condition, let's denote it as `new_v`.

State: **`v` is the next element in `adjacents_list[v]` that satisfies the condition (`distance[u]` is `-1`), `q` is the queue with the newly added `u`, and `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`.**
