Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, and `distances2[u]` is either `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]` depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`. Additionally, `distances1[u]` is always `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)` after the if-else block executes.***
