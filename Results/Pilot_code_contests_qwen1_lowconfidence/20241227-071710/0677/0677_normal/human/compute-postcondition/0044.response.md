The code sets the distance of node `u` to the distance of node `v` plus 1. The initial state includes `v` being the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` being the queue with its first element removed and now containing `u` in addition to the remaining elements, and `adjacents_list[v]` containing at least one element. The distance of node `u` is updated based on the distance of node `v`.

After executing the code:

- The distance of node `u` is updated to `distance[v] + 1`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed and now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and the distance of node `u` is set to `distance[v] + 1`.

Output State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed and now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and the distance of node `u` is set to `distance[v] + 1`.**
