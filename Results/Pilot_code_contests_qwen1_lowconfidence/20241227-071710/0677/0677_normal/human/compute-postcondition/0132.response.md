Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1.
   - `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`.
   - `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element.
   - `u` is in `stack`.
   - `visited[u]` is currently `True`.
   - `pi[u]` is equal to `v`.
   - `determinate` is `True`.
   - `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1`.
   - `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   distances2[u] = max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The code updates `distances2[u]` based on the maximum of `distances2[v] + 1` and `heights2[u]`.
   - Since `v` was popped from `stack`, its value is known from the previous state.
   - `heights2[u]` is not directly specified, so it remains as it was in the previous state.

4. **Calculating the Result:**
   - `distances2[u]` is updated to the maximum of `distances2[v] + 1` and `heights2[u]`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

5. **Output State:**
   - `len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1 (unchanged).
   - `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack` (unchanged).
   - `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element (unchanged).
   - `u` is in `stack` (unchanged).
   - `visited[u]` is currently `True` (unchanged).
   - `pi[u]` is equal to `v` (unchanged).
   - `determinate` is `True` (unchanged).
   - `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1` (unchanged).
   - `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u]` (unchanged).
   - `distances2[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1; `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`; `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element; `u` is in `stack`; `visited[u]` is currently `True`; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`; `determinate` is `True`; `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1`; `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u]`; `distances2[u]` is `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`**
