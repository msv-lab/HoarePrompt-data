Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`. After executing the if-else block, if `determinate` is `False`, then `distances1[u]` remains as `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` and `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold regardless of the value of `determinate`.***
