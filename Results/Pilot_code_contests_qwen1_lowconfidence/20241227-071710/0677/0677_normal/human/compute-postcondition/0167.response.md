The code updates `distances2[u]` to be equal to `heights1[u]`. The previous value of `distances2[u]` is unchanged, but now it is set to `heights1[u]`. The other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, the stack now contains `u`, and `distances1[u]` is updated to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`.**
