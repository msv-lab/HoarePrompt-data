The code assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `True`
- `stack` contains `u`
- `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`

After executing the line `distances2[u] = heights1[u]`, the value of `distances2[u]` changes to `heights1[u]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
