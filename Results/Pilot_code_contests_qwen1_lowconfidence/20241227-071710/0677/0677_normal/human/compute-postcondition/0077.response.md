The code assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Given the initial conditions, we know the following:

- `len(stack)` is at least 1.
- `pi[u]` is `v`.
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.
- `visited[u]` is `True`.
- `determinate` is `True`.
- `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.
- `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.
- `distances1[u]` is not equal to `heights1[u]`.

After executing the line `distances2[u] = heights1[u]`, the value of `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`, which is `distances1[v] - 1`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `len(stack)` is at least 1.
- `pi[u]` is `v`.
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.
- `visited[u]` is `True`.
- `determinate` is `True`.
- `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.
- `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.
- `distances1[u]` is not equal to `heights1[u]`.
- `distances2[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, `distances1[u]` is not equal to `heights1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`**
