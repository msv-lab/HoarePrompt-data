`q` is appended with the value `u`. The value of `v` remains the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q` before the append operation. The value of `adjacents_list[v]` remains unchanged, and `distance[u]` is equal to `distance[v] + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and `distance[u]` is equal to `distance[v] + 1`.

Output State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and `distance[u]` is equal to `distance[v] + 1`.**
