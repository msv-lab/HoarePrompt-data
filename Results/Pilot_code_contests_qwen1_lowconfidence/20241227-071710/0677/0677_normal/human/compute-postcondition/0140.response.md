The code `distances2[u] = heights1[u]` assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1
- `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`
- `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element
- `u` is in `stack`
- `visited[u]` is currently `True`
- `pi[u]` is equal to `v`
- `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`
- `determinate` is `False`
- `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise it retains its original value
- `distances2[u]` is `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise it retains its original value

After the code is executed, `distances2[u]` is updated to the value of `heights1[u]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is in `stack`, `visited[u]` is currently `True`, `pi[u]` is equal to `v`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `determinate` is `False`, `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise it retains its original value, `distances2[u]` is now `heights1[u]`.**
