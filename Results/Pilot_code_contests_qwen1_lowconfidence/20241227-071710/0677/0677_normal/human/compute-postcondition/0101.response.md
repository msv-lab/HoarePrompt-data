Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` remains `False`. If `not visited[u]` is true, then `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]` and `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `distances2[u]` and `distances1[u]` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.***
