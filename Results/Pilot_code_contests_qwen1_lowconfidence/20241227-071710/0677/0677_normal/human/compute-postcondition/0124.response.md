`visited[u]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the node `u` is now considered visited. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 but less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is an unvisited node (now visited), and `visited[u]` is currently True; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`**
