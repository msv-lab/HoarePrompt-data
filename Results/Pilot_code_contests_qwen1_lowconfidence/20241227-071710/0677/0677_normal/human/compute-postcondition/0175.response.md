Output State: **`pi[u]` for all `u` in `adjacents_list` is set such that if `u` is reachable from any node in the stack, `pi[u]` points to the node in the stack that reaches `u` with the shortest path length. `visited[u]` is `True` for all nodes `u` that are reachable from the stack. `determinate` is `True` for all nodes `u` where the shortest path length and height are determined. `distances1[u]` is the shortest distance from the stack to `u`. `distances2[u]` is the secondary shortest distance from the stack to `u`. `stack` is a list containing all nodes that were pushed into it during the loop execution.**

### Explanation:
- **`pi[u]`**: This is the parent pointer for each node `u` in the adjacency list. It points to the node in the stack that reaches `u` with the shortest path length. This is updated whenever a new path is found to be shorter.
- **`visited[u]`**: This is `True` for all nodes `u` that are reachable from the nodes in the stack. Initially, only the nodes in the stack have this property, but as the loop progresses, more nodes get marked as visited.
- **`determinate`**: This flag indicates whether the shortest path length and height for a node `u` are determined. Once `determinate` is `True` for a node, it remains `True`.
- **`distances1[u]`**: This is the shortest distance from the stack to node `u`. It is updated when a new shortest path is found.
- **`distances2[u]`**: This is the secondary shortest distance from the stack to node `u`. It is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop.
- **`stack`**: This list contains all nodes that were pushed into it during the loop execution. These nodes are part of the shortest path tree rooted at the initial node(s) in the stack.

### Special Case:
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `len(stack)` is 0 initially), then:
  - `pi[u]` is undefined for all nodes `u`.
  - `visited[u]` is `False` for all nodes `u`.
  - `determinate` is `False` for all nodes `u`.
  - `distances1[u]` is `None` for all nodes `u`.
  - `distances2[u]` is `None` for all nodes `u`.
  - `stack` is an empty list.

This ensures that all variables retain their original or undefined values if the loop does not execute.
