Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is in `stack`, and `visited[u]` is currently `True`. If `not visited[u]` is `False`, `pi[u]` is equal to `v`, `determinate` remains unchanged, `heights1[u]` retains its original value, and `distances2[u]` retains its original value. If `not visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` remains `False`, `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise it retains its original value, and `distances2[u]` is now `heights1[u]`.***
