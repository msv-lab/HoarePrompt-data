The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given that `v` is the value of `pi[u]`, the new value of `distances1[u]` depends on the value of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[pi[u]] + 1`.

Since the exact values of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[pi[u]]` are not specified, we represent them in their symbolic form. However, we know the following:

- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` remains `True`
- `stack` contains `u`

Therefore, the updated state of `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `stack` contains `u`, `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`**
