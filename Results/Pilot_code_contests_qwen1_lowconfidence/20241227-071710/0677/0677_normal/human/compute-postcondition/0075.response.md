The code updates `distances2[u]` based on the value of `distances2[v]` plus 1 and the value of `heights2[u]`. Since `pi[u]` is `v`, and `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, we know that `v` is a neighbor of `u`. However, the specific values of `distances2[v]` and `heights2[u]` are not given, so we will express `distances2[u]` in terms of these values.

Given:
- `distances2[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`
- The previous value of `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, and `distances1[u]` is equal to `heights1[u]`, so `distances1[u]` is also `distances1[v] - 1`.
- `visited[u]` is `True`.
- `determinate` is `True`.
- `len(stack)` is at least 1.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, the current value of `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, the current value of `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, and `distances1[u]` is equal to `heights1[u]`, `distances2[u]` is `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`**
