According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`. For the loop to execute again, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:

- `v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`.
- `q` now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements.
- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element (this condition is met since the loop ran).
- The distance of node `u` is set to `distance[v] + 1` if `distance[u]` was initially `-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `adjacents_list[v]` must still contain at least one element. Since it contained at least one element before and the loop just ran, it should still contain at least one element.

Thus, the state remains unchanged in terms of the number of elements in `adjacents_list[v]`.

State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and the distance of node `u` is set to `distance[v] + 1` if `distance[u]` was initially `-1`.**
