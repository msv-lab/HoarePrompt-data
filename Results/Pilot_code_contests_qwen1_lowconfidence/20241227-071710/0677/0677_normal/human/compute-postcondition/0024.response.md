`distance[u]` is assigned the value `distance[v] + 1`. The value of `distance[v]` is initially `-1`, so `distance[u]` becomes `-1 + 1`, which is `0`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`, `u` is an adjacent vertex of `v` whose distance is initially `-1`, `distance[u]` is `0`.

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`, `u` is an adjacent vertex of `v` whose distance is initially `-1`, `distance[u]` is `0`**.
