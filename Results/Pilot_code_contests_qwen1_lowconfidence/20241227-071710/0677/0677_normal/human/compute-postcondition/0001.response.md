`distance[s]` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `s` is an integer between `1` and `n` (inclusive), and the `distance` list is initialized with `-1` for all elements except the `s`-th element, which is now `0`. The `adjacents_list` and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that `1 ≤ s ≤ n`, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road, `n` is the total number of cities in Byteforces and equals the length of `adjacents_list`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, and `distance[s] = 0`.**
