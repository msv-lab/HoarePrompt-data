According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `adjacents_list` and the value of `v`. For the loop to execute, `v` must be a valid element from `q`, and `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed.
   - `q` is now the queue without its leftmost element.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop will execute if `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `v` is the leftmost element of `q`, `q` must have at least one element for `v` to be defined.
   - `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `q` must have at least one element.
- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element.

State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is now the queue without its leftmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element**
