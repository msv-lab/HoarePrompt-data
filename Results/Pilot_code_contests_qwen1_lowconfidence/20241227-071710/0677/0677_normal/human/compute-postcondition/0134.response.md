The code `distances2[u] = heights1[u]` assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. Based on the initial state, `heights1[u]` is specifically equal to `heights1[v] + 1`. Therefore, `distances2[u]` is now equal to `heights1[v] + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is in `stack`, `visited[u]` is currently True; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`; `determinate` is `True`; `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1`; `distances1[u]` is not equal to `heights1[u]`; `distances2[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1`**
