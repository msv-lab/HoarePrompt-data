`q` is a queue with its first element (which is `v`) removed, and `u` is appended to `q`. The distance of node `u` is set to 0. The value of `v` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`
- `q` is the queue with its first element removed and now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements
- `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element
- The distance of node `u` is now set to 0

Output State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed and now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and the distance of node `u` is now set to 0**
