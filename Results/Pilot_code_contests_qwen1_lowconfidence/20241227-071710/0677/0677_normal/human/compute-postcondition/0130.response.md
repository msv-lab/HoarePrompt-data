The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to be the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Given the conditions:

- `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1`
- `heights1[u] + 1` is greater than `distances2[v]`

This means `heights1[u]` is at least `heights1[v] + 1` and thus is greater than `distances2[v]`. So, `heights1[u]` is greater than `distances2[v] + 1`.

Therefore, `distances1[u]` will be set to `heights1[u]`.

The updated states are:
- `len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1
- `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`
- `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element
- `u` is in `stack`
- `visited[u]` is currently True
- `pi[u]` is equal to `v`
- `determinate` is `True`
- `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1`
- `distances1[u]` is now equal to `heights1[u]` (which is `heights1[v] + 1`)

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is in `stack`, `visited[u]` is currently True; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`; `determinate` is `True`; `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1`; `distances1[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
