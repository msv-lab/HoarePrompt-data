Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`. Additionally, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, and `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`.***

Explanation: Since the `if` condition `not determinate` is `False` in the given scenario, the `else` part does not execute. Therefore, the postcondition directly follows from the `if` part's postcondition.
