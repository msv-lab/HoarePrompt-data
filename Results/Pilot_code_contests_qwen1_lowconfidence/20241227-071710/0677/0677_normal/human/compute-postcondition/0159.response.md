Let's break down the given state and the for loop to determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `pi[u]`: The parent of node `u` in the shortest path tree.
- `visited[u]`: A boolean indicating whether node `u` has been visited.
- `determinate`: A boolean indicating whether certain conditions have been met.
- `distances1[u]`: The first distance value for node `u`.
- `distances2[u]`: The second distance value for node `u`.
- `If not visited[u]` is true, then `visited[u]` is set to `True`.
- Additionally, if `not determinate` is true, then:
  - `distances1[u]` is set to `distances1[v] + 1`
  - `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`
- Otherwise:
  - Either `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` and `distances2[u]` is set to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`
  - Or `distances1[u]` does not equal `heights1[u]` and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`.

### For Loop:
```python
for u in adjacents_list[v]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables to Update:**
   - `visited[u]`: This variable is updated if it was previously not visited.
   - `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]`: These variables are updated based on the condition involving `determinate` and other values.

2. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `u` must be one of the adjacent nodes of `v` that hasn't been visited yet or hasn't had its distances determined.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - After processing `u` in the current iteration, `u` should be marked as visited (`visited[u] = True`).
   - Depending on the condition, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` will be updated.
   - The next iteration will consider the next adjacent node `u` from `adjacents_list[v]`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

Assuming `u` has been processed in the current iteration, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `visited[u]` is now `True`.
- `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated according to the rules specified.
- The next `u` to be processed will be the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`.

Given the above, the new state at the start of the next iteration can be described as follows:

**State: **`pi[u]` is unchanged, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is unchanged, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated, and the next `u` to be processed is the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`**.
