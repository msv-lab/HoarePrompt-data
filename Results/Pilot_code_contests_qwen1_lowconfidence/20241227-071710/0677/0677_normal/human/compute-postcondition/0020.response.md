Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `len(q) > 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as the queue `q` is not empty.

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed.
   - `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed.
   - `adjacents_list[v]` must have contained elements for the loop to execute.
   - For every `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, `distance[u]` is now set to `distance[v] + 1` and `u` is appended to `q`.

3. **Determining Next State**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure that `q` is not empty after this iteration.
   - From the given information, `v` is removed from `q` in the current iteration. Therefore, `q` will be one element shorter than before.
   - For `q` to still contain at least one element, there must be at least one element added to `q` during this iteration.
   - According to the loop body, elements are added to `q` only if they meet the criteria (`distance[u]` was initially `-1`).

4. **Ensuring `q` is Not Empty**:
   - After removing `v` from `q`, there must be at least one element added to `q` from `adjacents_list[v]`.
   - This means that `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `q` is not empty after the current iteration. Specifically, we need to ensure that `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element `u` such that `distance[u]` was initially `-1`.

**Final State**:
- `v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed.
- `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed.
- `adjacents_list[v]` must have contained at least one element `u` whose `distance[u]` was initially `-1` (and now `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1` and `u` is appended to `q`).
- For every `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` where `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, `distance[u]` is now set to `distance[v] + 1` and `u` is appended to `q`.

State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must have contained at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`**, and for every such `u`, `distance[u]` is now set to `distance[v] + 1` and `u` is appended to `q`.
