The code sets `determinate` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, and `distances2[u]` is updated based on the conditions provided.
