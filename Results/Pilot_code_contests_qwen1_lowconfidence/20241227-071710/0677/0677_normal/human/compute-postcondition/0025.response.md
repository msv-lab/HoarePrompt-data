`q` is a queue from which the leftmost element `v` was removed. `u` is an adjacent vertex of `v` whose distance was initially `-1`. The code appends `u` to the end of the queue `q`. The value of `adjacents_list[v][...].distance` remains unchanged, and the value of `distance[u]` also remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed and `u` appended, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`, `u` is an adjacent vertex of `v` whose distance is initially `-1`, `distance[u]` is `0`**
