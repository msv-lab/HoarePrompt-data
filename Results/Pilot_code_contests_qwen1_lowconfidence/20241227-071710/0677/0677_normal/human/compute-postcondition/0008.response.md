The code sets `distance[u]` to `distance[v] + 1`. Given that `distance[u]` was previously equal to -1, this means `distance[u]` will now be set to `distance[v] + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is now the queue without its leftmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `distance[u]` is now equal to `distance[v] + 1`.**
