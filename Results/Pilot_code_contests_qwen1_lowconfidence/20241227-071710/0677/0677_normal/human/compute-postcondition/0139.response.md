Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is in `stack`, `visited[u]` is currently `True`; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`; `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`, `determinate` is `False`; `heights1[u]` is `heights1[v] + 1` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise it retains its original value. `distances2[u]` is `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, otherwise it retains its original value.**
