The code sets `determinate` to `True`. This changes the value of `determinate` but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`.**
