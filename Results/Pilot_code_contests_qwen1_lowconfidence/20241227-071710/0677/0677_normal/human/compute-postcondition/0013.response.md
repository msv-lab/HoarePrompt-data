The code snippet `q.append(u)` appends the variable `u` to the right end of the queue `q`. Based on the initial state, `u` is added as the new rightmost element of `q`.

- `v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed.
- `q` is now the queue without its leftmost element.
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.
- `distance[u]` is now equal to `distance[v] + 1`.
- `q` now includes `u` as its new rightmost element.

After appending `u` to `q`, the updated state is:
- `v` is still the leftmost element of `q` which was removed.
- `q` now includes `u` as its new rightmost element.
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element.
- `distance[u]` is now equal to `distance[v] + 1`.

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is now the queue with `u` as its new rightmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is equal to `distance[v] + 1`**
