The code removes the leftmost element from the queue `q` and assigns it to `v`. The value of `v` is now the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, and `q` is updated to be the queue with its leftmost element removed. The precondition that `adjacents_list[v]` must have contained at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1` remains valid.

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must have contained at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`**
