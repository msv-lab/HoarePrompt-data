`u` is appended to `stack`. The length of `stack` increases by 1. The value of `v` remains the same as the element that was previously popped from `stack`. `adjacents_list[v]` still contains at least one element. `u` is now marked as visited. `visited[u]` is currently True; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`; `determinate` remains `False`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 and less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is in `stack`, `visited[u]` is currently True; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`; `determinate` is `False`**
