Postcondition: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`. If `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, then `distances1[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` and `distances2[u]` remains as `heights1[u]`. Otherwise, `distances2[u]` is updated to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` and `distances1[u]` remains as `heights1[u]`.**
