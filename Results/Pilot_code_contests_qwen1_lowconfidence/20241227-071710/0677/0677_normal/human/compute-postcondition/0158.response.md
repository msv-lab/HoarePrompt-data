Postcondition: ***`pi[u]`, `visited[u]`, `determinate`, `distances1[u]`, and `distances2[u]` are as follows: If `not visited[u]` is true, then `visited[u]` is set to `True`. Additionally, if `not determinate` is true, then `distances1[u]` is set to `distances1[v] + 1` and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`. Otherwise, either `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]` and `distances2[u]` is set to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`, or `distances1[u]` does not equal `heights1[u]` and `distances2[u]` is set to `heights1[u]`.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts (although the else part does not change the state in this case).
