The code `distance[u] = distance[v] + 1` updates the distance of node `u` to be one more than the distance of node `v`. Given the initial conditions, `distance[v]` is currently set to -1 (unvisited), which means `distance[u]` will also be set to -1 + 1, resulting in `distance[u]` being 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` is the queue with its first element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and the distance of node `u` is now set to 0.**
