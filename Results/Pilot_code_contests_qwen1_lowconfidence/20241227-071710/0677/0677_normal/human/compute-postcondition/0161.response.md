`visited[u]` is set to `True`. The value of `pi[u]` remains `v`, `determinate` remains unchanged, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` remain updated, and the next `u` to be processed is the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is unchanged, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated, and the next `u` to be processed is the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`**
