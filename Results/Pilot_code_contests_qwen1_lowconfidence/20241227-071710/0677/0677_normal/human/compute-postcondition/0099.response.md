The code updates the value of `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`. Based on the initial state, we know that `distances2[u]` was either `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]`. However, after the code runs, `distances2[u]` is now specifically `heights1[u]`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`; `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`; `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`.**
