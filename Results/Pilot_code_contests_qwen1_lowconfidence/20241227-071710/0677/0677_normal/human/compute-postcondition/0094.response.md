The code updates `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`. This means the previous value of `distances2[u]`, which was `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`, is now replaced with `heights1[u]`.

The other variables are not affected, so they retain their original states.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, and `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`**
