To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given Conditions:
- `s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\)
- `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road
- `n` is the total number of cities in Byteforces and equals the length of `adjacents_list`
- `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, and `distance[s] = 0`
- `q` is a deque containing `s`

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as the length of `q` is greater than 0:
```python
while len(q) > 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute at least one more time, the condition `len(q) > 0` must be true. Currently, `q` is a deque containing only `s`, so `len(q)` is 1, which is greater than 0. 

No adjustments to the current state are necessary because the condition `len(q) > 0` is already satisfied with the given information. The initial setup ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop condition is already met with the given state, no further adjustments are needed.

**State:**
State: **`s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq n\), `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road, `n` is the total number of cities in Byteforces and equals the length of `adjacents_list`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, and `distance[s] = 0`; `q` is a deque containing `s`**
