The code initializes a deque object `q`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `adjacents_list`, `n`, or `distance`. The only change is the creation of the deque object `q`.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that `1 ≤ s ≤ n`, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road, `n` is the total number of cities in Byteforces and equals the length of `adjacents_list`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, and `distance[s] = 0`; `q` is initialized as a deque.**
