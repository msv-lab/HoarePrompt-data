Postcondition: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`, `u` is an adjacent vertex of `v` whose distance is initially `-1`. The current value of `distance[u]` is `-1`**
