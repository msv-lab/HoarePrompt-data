`q` is appended with the value `u`. The value of `v` remains the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, and `q` now has `u` added to it. The value of `adjacents_list[v]` still contains at least one element with `distance` initially set to `-1`. The value of `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed plus `u`, `adjacents_list[v]` must still have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`, `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`**
