Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed.
   - `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed.
   - If `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, then `distance[u]` is set to `0` and `u` is appended to the queue `q`.
   - `adjacents_list[v]` must still have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each adjacent node `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one element `u` in `adjacents_list[v]` whose `distance` is initially `-1`.
   - If such an element `u` is found, its `distance` is set to `0` and `u` is appended to the queue `q`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `v` remains unchanged for the current iteration.
   - `q` is the queue with its leftmost element removed, so the next leftmost element of `q` will be the new value of `v` in the next iteration.
   - `adjacents_list[v]` must still have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`. This condition must hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `v` remains the same.
- `q` will have its leftmost element removed (so the next leftmost element becomes the new `v`).
- `adjacents_list[v]` must still have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must still have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`**.
