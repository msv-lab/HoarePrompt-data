The code snippet `stack.append(u)` adds the variable `u` to the end of the stack. The previous values of the variables are as follows:

- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `False`
- `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated
- The next `u` to be processed is the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`

After executing the code, the stack now contains `u` at its end. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated, the stack now contains `u`, and the next `u` to be processed is the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`.**
