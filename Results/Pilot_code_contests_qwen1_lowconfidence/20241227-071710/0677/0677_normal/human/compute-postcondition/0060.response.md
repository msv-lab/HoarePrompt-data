Postcondition: **`pi` is a dictionary with key `u` mapped to value `v`; `visited` is a dictionary with key `u` mapped to value `True`; `determinate` remains `False` unless `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, in which case it becomes `True`; `stack` contains `u` (plus any other elements that were already in the stack); `distances1[u]` is either `distances1[v] + 1` or `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)` depending on whether `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`; `distances2[u]` is either `heights1[u]` or `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` depending on the same condition.**
