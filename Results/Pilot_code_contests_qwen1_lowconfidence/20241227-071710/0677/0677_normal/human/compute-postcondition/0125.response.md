The code `determinate = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `determinate`. This assignment does not affect any other variables or conditions. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `determinate`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is greater than 0 but less by 1, `v` is equal to the element that was popped from `stack`, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is an unvisited node (now visited), and `visited[u]` is currently True; `pi[u]` is equal to `v`; `determinate` is `False`**
