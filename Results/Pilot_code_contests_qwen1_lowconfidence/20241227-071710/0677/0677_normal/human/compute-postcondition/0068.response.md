The variable `determinate` is assigned the value `False`. The initial values of `len(stack)`, `pi[u]`, `adjacents_list[v]`, and `visited[u]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 0, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `False`.**
