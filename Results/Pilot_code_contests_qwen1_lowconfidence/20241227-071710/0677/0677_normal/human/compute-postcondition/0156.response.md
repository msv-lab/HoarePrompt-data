The code assigns the value of `heights1[u]` to `distances2[u]`. This updates the value of `distances2[u]` but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, and `stack` contains `u`; `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`; `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`**
