Postcondition: ***`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is either `True` or remains `False`. Furthermore, `distances2[u]` is determined as follows: if `heights1[u] + 1 > distances2[v]`, then `distances2[u]` is `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` if `distances1[u]` equals `heights1[u]`, otherwise `distances2[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`. Additionally, `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, and `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.***
