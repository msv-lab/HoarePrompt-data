State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`, `u` is an adjacent vertex of `v` whose distance is initially `-1`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The for loop iterates over the elements in `adjacents_list[v]`.
2. For the loop to execute, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`.
3. The variable `u` represents each element (vertex) in `adjacents_list[v]` as the loop iterates.
4. Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `u` is one of the adjacent vertices of `v` whose `distance` was initially `-1`.

Hence, the required adjustments are:
- `v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed.
- `adjacents_list[v]` must have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`.
- `u` is an adjacent vertex of `v` whose `distance` was initially `-1`.
