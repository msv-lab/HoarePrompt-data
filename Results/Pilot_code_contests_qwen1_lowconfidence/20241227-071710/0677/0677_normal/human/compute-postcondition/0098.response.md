The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to `distances1[v] + 1`. Given the initial state:

- `len(stack)` is at least 2
- `pi[u]` is `v`
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element
- `visited[u]` is `True`
- `determinate` is `True`
- `distances2[u]` is either `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]`
- `distances1[u]` is always `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`

After executing `distances1[u] = distances1[v] + 1`, the value of `distances1[u]` is updated to `distances1[v] + 1`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`; `distances2[u]` is either `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])` or `heights1[u]`; `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v] + 1`.**
