The code updates the value of `distance[u]` to `distance[v] + 1`. Given the initial state, `v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, and the distance of node `u` is set to `distance[v] + 1` if `distance[u]` was initially `-1`.

Since the distance of node `u` is explicitly set to `distance[v] + 1`, this means that the distance of `u` is updated. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the value of the element removed from the left side of the queue `q`, `q` now contains `u` in addition to the remaining elements, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and `distance[u]` is equal to `distance[v] + 1`.**
