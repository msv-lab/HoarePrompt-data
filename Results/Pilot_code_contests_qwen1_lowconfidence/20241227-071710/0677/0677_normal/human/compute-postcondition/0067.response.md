`visited[u]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the node `u` has been marked as visited. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 0, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and node `u` has been visited (i.e., `visited[u]` is `True`).**
