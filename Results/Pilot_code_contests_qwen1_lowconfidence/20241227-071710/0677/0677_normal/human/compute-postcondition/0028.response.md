`distance[u]` is assigned the value of `distance[v] + 1`. The value of `distance[v]` is known because it must have had a value initially (even if it was -1). The value of `u` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied that `u` is a node connected to `v` in the adjacency list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed, `adjacents_list[v]` must still have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`; `distance[u]` is `distance[v] + 1`**
