The code sets the variable `determinate` to `False`. The values of the other variables (`len(stack)`, `pi[u]`, `adjacents_list[v]`, `visited[u]`) remain unchanged as no operation is performed on them. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `False`.**
