To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the given states at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop condition is:
```
while len(stack) > 0:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as the length of the stack is greater than 0.

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `len(stack)` is at least 1 (meaning `len(stack) >= 1`)
- `pi[u]` is `v` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains all its elements
- `visited[u]` is `True` for all `u` in `adjacents_list[v]`
- `determinate` remains `False` for all iterations
- `distances1[u]` is the distance from the starting node to `u`
- `distances2[u]` is the alternative distance to `u` considering heights
- `heights1[u]` and `heights2[u]` remain their original values
- `stack` contains all nodes that were pushed during the loop iterations

Since the loop continues as long as `len(stack) > 0`, and we know from the given state that `len(stack) >= 1`, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `len(stack)` remains greater than 0.

Thus, no other states need to be adjusted except ensuring that `len(stack)` is still greater than 0.

State: **`len(stack)` must be greater than 0**
