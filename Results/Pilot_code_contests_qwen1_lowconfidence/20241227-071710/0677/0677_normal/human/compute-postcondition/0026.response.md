Postcondition: ***`v` is the leftmost element of `q` before it was removed, `q` is now the queue with its leftmost element removed. If `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, then `distance[u]` is set to `0` and `u` is appended to the queue `q`. `adjacents_list[v]` must still have at least one element whose `distance` was initially `-1`.***
