Postcondition: ***`v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is now the queue with `u` as its new rightmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, and `distance[u]` is equal to `distance[v] + 1`. If `distance[u]` was initially `-1`, it is now set to `distance[v] + 1`.***
