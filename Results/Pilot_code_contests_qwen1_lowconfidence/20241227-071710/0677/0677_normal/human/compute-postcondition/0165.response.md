The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Since `v` is `pi[u]` and `distances2[v]` is already updated, we use that value. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `distances1[u]` is updated to `max(heights1[u], distances2[pi[u]] + 1)`.
- `visited[u]` remains `True`.
- `determinate` remains `True`.
- `distances2[u]` remains unchanged.
- The stack still contains `u`.
- The next `u` to be processed is the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `True`, `distances2[u]` is unchanged, the stack now contains `u`, and `distances1[u]` is updated to `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)` where `v` is `pi[u]`.**
