The code sets `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`. Based on the initial conditions:

- `heights1[u]` is already defined.
- `distances2[u]` was previously calculated based on conditions involving `distances1[v]` and `heights2[u]`.

After running the code, `distances2[u]` is updated to `heights1[u]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`, `heights1[u]` is `distances1[v] - 1`, and `distances1[u]` is `distances1[v]`, `distances1[v]` is `distances1[v] - 1`.**
