The code updates `distances2[u]` to `heights1[u]`. Given the initial conditions, `distances1[u]` was previously set to `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`, but now it is no longer relevant since `distances2[u]` is directly set to `heights1[u]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`; `distances1[u]` remains as `max(distances2[v] + 1, heights2[u])`, `distances2[u]` is `heights1[u]`.**
