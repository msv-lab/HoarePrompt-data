`pi[u]` is assigned the value of `v`, which is the popped value from `stack`. The length of `stack` decreases by 1 because a value has been popped. The state of `adjacents_list[v]` and the unvisited status of node `u` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `len(stack)` is at least 0 (since one value was popped), `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and node `u` has not been visited.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 0, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, and node `u` has not been visited.**
