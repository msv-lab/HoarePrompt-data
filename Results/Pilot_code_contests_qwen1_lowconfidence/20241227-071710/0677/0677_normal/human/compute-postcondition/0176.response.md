Output State: **`stack` is empty, `pi[u]` for all `u` is set such that if `u` is reachable from any node originally in `stack`, `pi[u]` points to the node in the stack that reaches `u` with the shortest path length, `visited[u]` is `True` for all nodes `u` that are reachable from the stack, `determinate` is `True` for all nodes `u` where the shortest path length and height are determined, `distances1[u]` is the shortest distance from the original start node to `u`, `distances2[u]` is the secondary shortest distance from the original start node to `u`, `heights1[u]` and `heights2[u]` remain their original values.**
