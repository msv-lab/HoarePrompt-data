`stack` appends the value of `u` to itself. The length of `stack` increases by 1. The values of `pi[u]`, `adjacents_list[v]`, `visited[u]`, and `determinate` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `len(stack)` is at least 1 (since it was at least 0 and we added 1), `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `False`.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` must contain at least one element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `False`.**
