The code sets the variable `determinate` to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`, `distances1[u]` and `distances2[u]` are updated, and the next `u` to be processed is the next adjacent node in `adjacents_list[v]`**
