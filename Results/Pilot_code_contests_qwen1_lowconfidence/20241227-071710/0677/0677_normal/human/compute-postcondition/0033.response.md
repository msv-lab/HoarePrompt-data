The code `q.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `q`. This changes the content of `q` by adding `u` to it, but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`v` is the next element in `adjacents_list[v]` that satisfies the condition (`distance[u]` is `-1`); `q` includes the newly added `u`; `distance[u]` is set to `distance[v] + 1`; `q` is updated with `u` appended**
