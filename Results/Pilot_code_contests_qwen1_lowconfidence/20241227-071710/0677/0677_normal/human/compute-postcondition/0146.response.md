`determinate` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `pi[u]` and `visited[u]` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`.

Output State: **`pi[u]` is `v`, `visited[u]` is `True`, `determinate` is `False`**
