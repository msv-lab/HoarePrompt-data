The code `pi[u] = v` updates the value of `pi[u]` to `v`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `len(stack)` is at least 1 (unchanged)
- `pi[u]` is now `v`
- `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element (unchanged)
- `visited[u]` is still `True` (unchanged)
- `determinate` remains `False` (unchanged)

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 1, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` remains `False`.**
