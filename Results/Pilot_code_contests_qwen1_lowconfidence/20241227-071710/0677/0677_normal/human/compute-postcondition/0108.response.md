The code updates the value of `distances1[u]` to be the maximum of `heights1[u]` and `distances2[v] + 1`. Since `distances2[v]` is an existing value (it's not modified in this snippet), we can denote its value as `d_v`. Thus, `distances1[u]` is updated to `max(heights1[u], d_v + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`len(stack)` is at least 2, `pi[u]` is `v`, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one remaining unvisited element, `visited[u]` is `True`, and `determinate` is `True`; `distances1[u]` is `max(heights1[u], distances2[v] + 1)`**
