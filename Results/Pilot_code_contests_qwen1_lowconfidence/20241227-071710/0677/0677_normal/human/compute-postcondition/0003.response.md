The code snippet `q.append(s)` appends the value of `s` to the end of the deque `q`. Given the initial state:

- `s` is an integer such that `1 ≤ s ≤ n`
- `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road
- `n` is the total number of cities in Byteforces and equals the length of `adjacents_list`
- `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, and `distance[s] = 0`
- `q` is initialized as a deque

After executing `q.append(s)`, the value of `s` is added to the deque `q`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that `1 ≤ s ≤ n`, `adjacents_list` is a list of lists where `adjacents_list[i]` contains all cities directly connected to city `i` by a road, `n` is the total number of cities in Byteforces and equals the length of `adjacents_list`, `distance` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, and `distance[s] = 0`; `q` is a deque containing `s`.**
