The code updates the value of `distance[u]` to `distance[v] + 1`. This means that the value of `distance[u]` is now the previous value of `distance[u]` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the leftmost element of `q` which was removed, `q` is still the queue with `u` as its new rightmost element, `adjacents_list[v]` contains at least one element, `distance[u]` is equal to `distance[v] + 1`.**
