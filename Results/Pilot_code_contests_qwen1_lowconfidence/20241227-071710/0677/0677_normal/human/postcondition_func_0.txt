The function `func_1()` reads the first line of input from `stdin`, which should contain two integers separated by a space, representing the number of cities and the number of cities being attacked, respectively. It then converts these integers to type `int` using the `map()` function and returns a `map` object containing these two integers. This function does not handle any edge cases such as invalid input formats (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect number of integers). Therefore, it assumes that the input is always correctly formatted.
