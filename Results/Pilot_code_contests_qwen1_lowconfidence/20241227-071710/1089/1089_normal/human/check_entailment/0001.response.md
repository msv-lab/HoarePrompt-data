Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all airports belong to the same company. In such a scenario, the cost should always be zero since Vladik can travel between any two airports for free. However, the current implementation calculates the minimum distance regardless of the company ownership, which leads to incorrect results in this specific case.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1 3
000
```

The expected output is `0` because all airports belong to the same company, so Vladik can travel from airport 1 to airport 3 for free. However, the program will output `2` because it calculates the distance without considering the company ownership.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to see if all airports belong to the same company and return `0` if they do. Here is a modified version of the function:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    (n, s, f) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, list(stdin.readline().strip())))
    
    # Check if all airports belong to the same company
    if all(numbers[i] == numbers[0] for i in range(n)):
        stdout.write("0\n")
        return
    
    s -= 1
    f -= 1
    (s, f) = (min(s, f), max(s, f))
    if numbers[0] == numbers[s]:
        cnt = [1]
    else:
        cnt = [0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[s]:
            cnt.append(cnt[-1] + 1)
        else:
            cnt.append(cnt[-1])
    
    ans = f - s
    if numbers[s] != numbers[f]:
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] >= cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        if r != n:
            ans = min(ans, f - r)
    else:
        ans = 0
    
    stdout.write(str(ans))
```

With this modification, the program correctly handles the case where all airports belong to the same company, ensuring it outputs `0` in such scenarios.
