You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vladik is a competitive programmer. This year he is going to win the International Olympiad in Informatics. But it is not as easy as it sounds: the question Vladik face now is to find the cheapest way to get to the olympiad.

Vladik knows n airports. All the airports are located on a straight line. Each airport has unique id from 1 to n, Vladik's house is situated next to the airport with id a, and the place of the olympiad is situated next to the airport with id b. It is possible that Vladik's house and the place of the olympiad are located near the same airport. 

To get to the olympiad, Vladik can fly between any pair of airports any number of times, but he has to start his route at the airport a and finish it at the airport b.

Each airport belongs to one of two companies. The cost of flight from the airport i to the airport j is zero if both airports belong to the same company, and |i - j| if they belong to different companies.

Print the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of airports, the id of the airport from which Vladik starts his route and the id of the airport which he has to reach. 

The second line contains a string with length n, which consists only of characters 0 and 1. If the i-th character in this string is 0, then i-th airport belongs to first company, otherwise it belongs to the second.

Output

Print single integer — the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Examples

Input

4 1 4
1010


Output

1

Input

5 5 2
10110


Output

0

Note

In the first example Vladik can fly to the airport 2 at first and pay |1 - 2| = 1 (because the airports belong to different companies), and then fly from the airport 2 to the airport 4 for free (because the airports belong to the same company). So the cost of the whole flight is equal to 1. It's impossible to get to the olympiad for free, so the answer is equal to 1. 

In the second example Vladik can fly directly from the airport 5 to the airport 2, because they belong to the same company.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    (n, s, f) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, list(stdin.readline().strip())))
    cnt = [0 for i in range(n)]
    s -= 1
    f -= 1
    (s, f) = (min(s, f), max(s, f))
    if numbers[0] == numbers[s]:
        cnt[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[s]:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]
    ans = f - s
    if numbers[s] != numbers[f]:
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] >= cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        if r != n:
            ans = min(ans, f - r)
    else:
        ans = 0
    stdout.write(str(ans))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all airports belong to the same company. In such a scenario, the cost should always be zero since Vladik can travel between any two airports for free. However, the current implementation calculates the minimum distance regardless of the company ownership, which leads to incorrect results in this specific case.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 1 3
000
```

The expected output is `0` because all airports belong to the same company, so Vladik can travel from airport 1 to airport 3 for free. However, the program will output `2` because it calculates the distance without considering the company ownership.

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to see if all airports belong to the same company and return `0` if they do. Here is a modified version of the function:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    (n, s, f) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, list(stdin.readline().strip())))
    
    # Check if all airports belong to the same company
    if all(numbers[i] == numbers[0] for i in range(n)):
        stdout.write("0\n")
        return
    
    s -= 1
    f -= 1
    (s, f) = (min(s, f), max(s, f))
    if numbers[0] == numbers[s]:
        cnt = [1]
    else:
        cnt = [0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[s]:
            cnt.append(cnt[-1] + 1)
        else:
            cnt.append(cnt[-1])
    
    ans = f - s
    if numbers[s] != numbers[f]:
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] >= cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        if r != n:
            ans = min(ans, f - r)
    else:
        ans = 0
    
    stdout.write(str(ans))
```

With this modification, the program correctly handles the case where all airports belong to the same company, ensuring it outputs `0` in such scenarios.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and the second line is a string of length n consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer \( n \), two integers \( s \) and \( f \) (which are derived from the inputs \( a \) and \( b \)), and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). It calculates the minimum distance within the substring from index \( s \) to index \( f \) where the character changes from the one at index \( s \) to another character. Specifically, it constructs a list `cnt` where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the character at index \( s \) from the start of the string up to index \( i \). Then, based on whether the character at index \( s \) is different from the character at index \( f \), it either finds the nearest position to \( f \) where the character changes or concludes that no change occurs. The function ultimately writes the minimum distance found to the standard output. Potential edge cases include when \( s \) and \( f \) are the same (resulting in a distance of 0) or when the character at \( s \) is already the same as the one at \( f \) (resulting in a distance of 0). The function does not handle the case where \( s \) and \( f \) are out of bounds of the string, which could lead to undefined behavior.
