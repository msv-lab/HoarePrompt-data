You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vladik is a competitive programmer. This year he is going to win the International Olympiad in Informatics. But it is not as easy as it sounds: the question Vladik face now is to find the cheapest way to get to the olympiad.

Vladik knows n airports. All the airports are located on a straight line. Each airport has unique id from 1 to n, Vladik's house is situated next to the airport with id a, and the place of the olympiad is situated next to the airport with id b. It is possible that Vladik's house and the place of the olympiad are located near the same airport. 

To get to the olympiad, Vladik can fly between any pair of airports any number of times, but he has to start his route at the airport a and finish it at the airport b.

Each airport belongs to one of two companies. The cost of flight from the airport i to the airport j is zero if both airports belong to the same company, and |i - j| if they belong to different companies.

Print the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of airports, the id of the airport from which Vladik starts his route and the id of the airport which he has to reach. 

The second line contains a string with length n, which consists only of characters 0 and 1. If the i-th character in this string is 0, then i-th airport belongs to first company, otherwise it belongs to the second.

Output

Print single integer — the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Examples

Input

4 1 4
1010


Output

1

Input

5 5 2
10110


Output

0

Note

In the first example Vladik can fly to the airport 2 at first and pay |1 - 2| = 1 (because the airports belong to different companies), and then fly from the airport 2 to the airport 4 for free (because the airports belong to the same company). So the cost of the whole flight is equal to 1. It's impossible to get to the olympiad for free, so the answer is equal to 1. 

In the second example Vladik can fly directly from the airport 5 to the airport 2, because they belong to the same company.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and the second line is a string of length n consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    n, s, f = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, list(stdin.readline().strip())))
    cnt = [(0) for i in range(n)]
    s -= 1
    f -= 1
    s, f = min(s, f), max(s, f)
    if (numbers[0] == numbers[s]) :
        cnt[0] = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` is a list of length `n` with all elements equal to 0 except for the first element which is 1. If the first element of `numbers` is equal to the element at index `s` of `numbers`, then the first element of `cnt` is set to 1. There is no else part specified in the code.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[s]:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` is a list of length `n` where each element `cnt[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is the count of occurrences of `numbers[s]` up to index `j` in the list `numbers`. If `numbers[j]` equals `numbers[s]`, then `cnt[j+1]` is `cnt[j] + 1`; otherwise, `cnt[j+1]` is `cnt[j]`. If the loop does not execute, `cnt` remains as `[1] + [0]*(n-1)`.
    ans = f - s
    if (numbers[s] != numbers[f]) :
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            
            if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` remains as `[1] + [0]*(n-1)`, `ans` is `original_f - original_s` if `original_s <= original_f` and `ans` is `original_s - original_f` if `original_s > original_f`, and the current value of `numbers[s]` is not equal to `numbers[f]`; `l` is `0`, `r` is `1`, `m` is `0`. If `cnt[m] > cnt[f]` at this point, `r` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `l` is set to `1` and `m` is `1
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            
            if cnt[m] >= cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
            
        #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is 1, `r` is 2, `m` is 1, `cnt[m]` is less than `cnt[f]`.
        if (r != n) :
            ans = min(ans, f - r)
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` is 1, `r` is 2, `m` is 1. If `r` is not equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `f - 2`, and `cnt[m]` remains less than `cnt[f]`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of the if condition's outcome.
    else :
        ans = 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` remains as `[1] + [0]*(n-1)`. If `numbers[s] != numbers[f]`, then `l` is 1, `r` is 2, `m` is 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `f - 2`, with `cnt[m]` remaining less than `cnt[f]`. If `numbers[s] == numbers[f]`, then `ans` is `0`.
    stdout.write(str(ans))

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
