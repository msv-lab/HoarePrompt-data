`s` is assigned the value `s - 1`, which decreases the value of `s` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `n` is assigned the value read from the first space-separated integer.
- `s` is decreased by 1.
- `f` is assigned the value read from the third space-separated integer.
- `a` and `b` remain in their initial states.
- `cnt` is a list of length `n` with all elements equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value read from the first space-separated integer, `s` is decreased by 1, `f` is assigned the value read from the third space-separated integer, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` is a list of length `n` with all elements equal to 0.**
