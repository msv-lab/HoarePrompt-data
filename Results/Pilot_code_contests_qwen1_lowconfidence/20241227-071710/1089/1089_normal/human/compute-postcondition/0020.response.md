`cnt[i]` is assigned the value `cnt[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `cnt[3]` is set to `cnt[2] + 1`. However, since the initial state does not provide the value of `cnt[2]`, we cannot specify the exact value of `cnt[3]`. But we know that `cnt[3]` is one more than whatever `cnt[2]` was initially.

The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 remains valid, as the code snippet does not affect the value of `n`.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `cnt[3]` is `cnt[2] + 1`; n must be greater than 3**
