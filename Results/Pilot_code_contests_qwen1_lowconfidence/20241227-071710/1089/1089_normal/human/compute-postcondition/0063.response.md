`l` is assigned the value of `m`. The value of `m` is 1, so `l` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and `cnt[m]` must be less than `cnt[f]`; `m` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is 2, and `cnt[m]` must be less than `cnt[f]`; `m` is 1**
