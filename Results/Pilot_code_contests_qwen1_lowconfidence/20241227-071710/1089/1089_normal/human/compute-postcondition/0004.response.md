`f` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `f` was read from the third space-separated integer, so now `f` is one less than its original value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is decreased by 1, `f` is one less than the original third space-separated integer, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` is a list of length `n` with all elements equal to 0.**
