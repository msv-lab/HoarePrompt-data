Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is 2, `m` is 1, `cnt[m]` is less than `cnt[f]`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `r > l + 1`. Given the output state after multiple iterations, we observe that the values of `l` and `r` stabilize at 1 and 2 respectively, with `m` being consistently calculated as the midpoint between `l` and `r`.
- If `cnt[m]` is less than `cnt[f]`, `r` remains 2, and `l` remains 1. This indicates that the search range does not change and stays within the bounds defined by `l` and `r`.
- Since the loop terminates when `r` is no longer greater than `l + 1`, the final state of `l` and `r` will be such that `r == l + 1`. Given the provided iterations, the only consistent final state is `l = 1` and `r = 2`.
- `m` is always the midpoint, calculated as `(r + l) // 2`, which in this case is 1.
- The condition `cnt[m] < cnt[f]` ensures that the loop continues until this condition is met, indicating that `cnt[m]` is always less than `cnt[f]` when the loop exits.
