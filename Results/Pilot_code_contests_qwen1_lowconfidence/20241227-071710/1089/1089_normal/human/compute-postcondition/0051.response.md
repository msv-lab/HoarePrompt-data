`r` is assigned the value of `m`. The previous values of `l`, `m`, and `cnt[m]` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is -1, `r` is 0, `m` is 0, and the current value of `cnt[m]` is greater than or equal to `cnt[f]`.

Output State: **`l` is -1, `r` is 0, `m` is 0, and the current value of `cnt[m]` is greater than or equal to `cnt[f]`**
