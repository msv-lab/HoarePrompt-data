The code `cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]` assigns the value of `cnt[i - 1]` to `cnt[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2 and `n` is greater than 1, `i - 1` would be 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `cnt[1]`, it remains unchanged. The value of `i` and `n` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `cnt[2]` is equal to `cnt[1]`**
