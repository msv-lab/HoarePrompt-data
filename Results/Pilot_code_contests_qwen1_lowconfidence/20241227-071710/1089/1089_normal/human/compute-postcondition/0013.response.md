The code `cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]` assigns the value of `cnt[i - 1]` to `cnt[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `cnt[1]` is assigned the value of `cnt[0]`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `numbers[i]` is not equal to `numbers[s]`, `cnt[1]` is equal to `cnt[0]`**
