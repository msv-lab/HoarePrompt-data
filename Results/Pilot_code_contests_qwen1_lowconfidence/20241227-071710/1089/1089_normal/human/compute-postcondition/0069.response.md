Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` remains as `[1] + [0]*(n-1)`, `ans` is `original_f - original_s` if `original_s <= original_f` and `ans` is `original_s - original_f` if `original_s > original_f`, and `numbers[s] == numbers[f]`**
