Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States:
- \( i \) is \( n \)
- \( n \) is a positive integer
- \( s \) is the minimum of \( \text{original\_s} - 1 \) and \( \text{original\_f} - 1 \)
- \( f \) is the maximum of \( \text{original\_s} - 1 \) and \( \text{original\_f} - 1 \)
- \( a \) and \( b \) remain in their initial states
- \( \text{cnt} \) remains as \([1] + [0]*(n-1)\)
- \( \text{ans} \) is \( \text{original\_f} - \text{original\_s} \) if \( \text{original\_s} \leq \text{original\_f} \) and \( \text{ans} \) is \( \text{original\_s} - \text{original\_f} \) if \( \text{original\_s} > \text{original\_f} \)
- The current value of \( \text{numbers}[s] \) is not equal to \( \text{numbers}[f] \)
- \( l \) is \(-1\)
- \( r \) is \( n \)
- \( m \) is \((-1 + n) // 2\)

### Loop Condition:
\[ \text{while } r > l + 1: \]

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition \( r > l + 1 \) must hold true.

### Current Values:
- \( l = -1 \)
- \( r = n \)
- \( m = (-1 + n) // 2 \)

Given \( r = n \) and \( l = -1 \), we can see that:

\[ r - l - 1 = n - (-1) - 1 = n + 1 - 1 = n \]

Since \( n \) is a positive integer, \( n > 0 \), and therefore \( n > l + 1 \).

This means the current values already satisfy the loop condition, so no adjustment is necessary to the current states.

### Conclusion:
The states do not need to be adjusted because the loop condition \( r > l + 1 \) is already satisfied.
