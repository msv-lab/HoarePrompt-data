Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` is a list of length `n` where each element `cnt[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is the count of occurrences of `numbers[s]` up to index `j` in the list `numbers`. If `numbers[j]` equals `numbers[s]`, then `cnt[j+1]` is `cnt[j] + 1`; otherwise, `cnt[j+1]` is `cnt[j]`. If the loop does not execute, `cnt` remains as `[1] + [0]*(n-1)`.**
