`r` is reassigned the value of `m`, which is initially defined as `(r + l) // 2`. After this assignment, the value of `r` becomes `(r + l) // 2`, while `l` remains unchanged and `m` is no longer a separate variable but is replaced by the value `(r + l) // 2`. 

Output State: **`r` is `(r + l) // 2`, `l` is an unspecified value**
