Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` is a list of length `n` with all elements equal to 0 except for the first element which is 1. If the first element of `numbers` is equal to the element at index `s` of `numbers`, then the first element of `cnt` is set to 1. There is no else part specified in the code.***
