The code `m = (r + l) // 2` assigns the value of `(r + l) // 2` to the variable `m`. The values of `r` and `l` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `m` is now assigned the value of `(r + l) // 2`.

Output State: **`r` is an unspecified value, `l` is an unspecified value, `m` is `(r + l) // 2`**
