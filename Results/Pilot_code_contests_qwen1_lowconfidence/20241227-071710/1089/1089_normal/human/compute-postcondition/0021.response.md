The code `cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]` updates the value of `cnt[i]` to be equal to the value of `cnt[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the line `cnt[3] = cnt[2]` is executed. There is no initial value given for `cnt[2]`, so let's denote its value as `value_of_cnt_2`.

- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 3.
- `cnt[3]` is updated to be equal to `cnt[2]`, which means `cnt[3]` now holds the value of `cnt[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `cnt[3]` is equal to `cnt[2]`**
