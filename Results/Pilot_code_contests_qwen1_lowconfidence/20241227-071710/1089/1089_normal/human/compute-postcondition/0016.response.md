`cnt[i]` is assigned the value of `cnt[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `cnt[i - 1]` corresponds to `cnt[1]`. Since the value of `cnt[1]` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `cnt[1]` is some initial value, say `k`. Therefore, `cnt[2]` will be `k + 1`.

The initial state also mentions that `n` is greater than 1, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1; `cnt[2]` is `cnt[1] + 1`**
