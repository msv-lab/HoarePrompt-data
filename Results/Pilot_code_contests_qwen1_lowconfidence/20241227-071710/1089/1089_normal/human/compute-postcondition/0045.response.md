Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` remains as `[1] + [0]*(n-1)`, `ans` is `original_f - original_s` if `original_s <= original_f` and `ans` is `original_s - original_f` if `original_s > original_f`, and the current value of `numbers[s]` is not equal to `numbers[f]`; `l` is `0`, `r` is `1`, `m` is `0`. If `cnt[m] > cnt[f]` at this point, `r` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `l` is set to `1` and `m` is `1**.
