Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `l` and `r` are integers.
   - If `cnt[m]` is greater than or equal to `cnt[f]`, then `l` is -1 and `r` is 0.
   - Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `r > l + 1`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, based on the condition, we know that either:
     - `l = -1` and `r = 0` (if `cnt[m]` â‰¥ `cnt[f]`), or
     - `l = 0` and `r = 1` (if `cnt[m]` < `cnt[f]`).

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `r > l + 1` must hold true.
   - Let's check both cases:
     - **Case 1**: If `l = -1` and `r = 0`, then `r > l + 1` becomes `0 > -1 + 1`, which simplifies to `0 > 0`, which is false. Therefore, this case does not allow the loop to continue.
     - **Case 2**: If `l = 0` and `r = 1`, then `r > l + 1` becomes `1 > 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `1 > 1`, which is false. Therefore, this case also does not allow the loop to continue.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since neither of the current conditions (`l = -1` and `r = 0` or `l = 0` and `r = 1`) satisfy `r > l + 1`, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute one more time.
   - To satisfy `r > l + 1`, we need to change the values of `l` and `r` such that `r > l + 1` holds true.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states to make sure the loop condition is met.

**State Adjustment**:
- We need to change the states such that `r > l + 1` holds true.
- One way to achieve this is to set `l` to 0 and `r` to 2 (or any other values that satisfy `r > l + 1`).

Thus, the state adjustment is:
**State: `l` is 0, `r` is 2**.

This ensures that `r > l + 1` is true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
