`l` is assigned the value of `m`. From the initial state, we know that `m` is equal to `(r + l) // 2`. Therefore, after executing the code, `l` will be updated to `(r + l) // 2`. The values of `r` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an unspecified value, `l` is `(r + l) // 2`, `m` is `(r + l) // 2`**
