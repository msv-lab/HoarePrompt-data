To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given state and the loop condition.

### Given State:
- \( n \) is an integer.
- \( s \) is the minimum of \( \text{original\_s} - 1 \) and \( \text{original\_f} - 1 \).
- \( f \) is the maximum of \( \text{original\_s} - 1 \) and \( \text{original\_f} - 1 \).
- \( a \) and \( b \) remain in their initial states.
- \( \text{cnt} \) is a list of length \( n \) with all elements equal to 0 except for the first element which is 1.
- If the first element of \( \text{numbers} \) is equal to the element at index \( s \) of \( \text{numbers} \), then the first element of \( \text{cnt} \) is set to 1. There is no else part specified in the code.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values and State**: The loop starts with \( i = 1 \). For the loop to execute, the value of \( i \) must be within the range defined by the `range(1, n)` function. This means \( i \) must be at least 1 and less than \( n \).

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop will iterate from \( i = 1 \) up to \( i = n-1 \). Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if \( n > 1 \).

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop starts with \( i = 1 \), we need to ensure that \( i \) is indeed 1 at the start of the loop. This means \( i \) should be initialized to 1.
   - Additionally, for the loop to continue executing beyond the first iteration, \( n \) must be greater than 1.

### Final State:
- \( i \) is 1 (since the loop starts with \( i = 1 \)).
- \( n \) must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to iterate more than just the first time.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
