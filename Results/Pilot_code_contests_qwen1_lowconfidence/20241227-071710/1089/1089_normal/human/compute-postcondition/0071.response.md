Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` remains as `[1] + [0]*(n-1)`. If `numbers[s] != numbers[f]`, then `l` is 1, `r` is 2, `m` is 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `f - 2`, with `cnt[m]` remaining less than `cnt[f]`. If `numbers[s] == numbers[f]`, then `ans` is `0`.**
