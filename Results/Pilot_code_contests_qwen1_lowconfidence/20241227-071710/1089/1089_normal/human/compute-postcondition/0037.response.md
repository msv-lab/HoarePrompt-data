The value of `m` is initially set to `(r + l) // 2`. The code `r = m` updates the value of `r` to be equal to `m`. Since `m` is `(r + l) // 2`, after the assignment, `r` becomes `(r + l) // 2`. The value of `l` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is `(r + l) // 2`, `r` is `(r + l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged**
