`l` is assigned the value of `m`. The initial values of `m` and `r` are 0 and 1 respectively, and `cnt[m]` is less than `cnt[f]`. After the assignment, the value of `l` changes to 0, while the values of `r`, `m`, and `cnt[m] < cnt[f]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is 1, `m` is 0, `cnt[m]` is less than `cnt[f]`**
