The code updates the value of `m` to be the floor division of the sum of `r` and `l` by 2. Given the initial state:

- `l` is `-1`
- `r` is `1`

The calculation for `m` is:

\[ m = \left( \frac{r + l}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{1 + (-1)}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{0}{2} \right) = 0 \]

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`l` is -1, `r` is 1, `m` is 0**
