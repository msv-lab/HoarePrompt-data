According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r` and `l`. The loop condition is `r > l + 1`, which means that the loop can execute as long as `r` is greater than `l + 1`.

Right before the loop, we have the following states:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`
- `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`
- `a` and `b` remain in their initial states
- `cnt` remains as `[1] + [0]*(n-1)`
- `ans` is `original_f - original_s` if `original_s <= original_f` and `ans` is `original_s - original_f` if `original_s > original_f`
- The current value of `numbers[s]` is not equal to `numbers[f]`
- `l` is `-1`
- `r` is `n`

To make the loop execute at least once, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`. Given that `l` is `-1` and `r` is `n`, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `-1 + 1`, which simplifies to `n > 0`. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, this condition is satisfied.

No other states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes at least once. 

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the minimum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `f` is the maximum of `original_s - 1` and `original_f - 1`, `a` and `b` remain in their initial states, `cnt` remains as `[1] + [0]*(n-1)`, `ans` is `original_f - original_s` if `original_s <= original_f` and `ans` is `original_s - original_f` if `original_s > original_f`, and the current value of `numbers[s]` is not equal to `numbers[f]`; `l` is `-1`, `r` is `n`**.
