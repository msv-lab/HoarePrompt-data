To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues: `r > l + 1`.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is 2
- `m` is 1

The condition `r > l + 1` evaluates to `2 > 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `2 > 1`. This condition is true, so the loop can execute again.

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `r > l + 1` must remain true. Therefore, we need to ensure that this condition holds true for the next iteration.

Let's break it down:

1. The current values are `l = 0` and `r = 2`.
2. The condition `r > l + 1` is `2 > 0 + 1`, which is true.
3. For the loop to continue, `r` must still be greater than `l + 1` in the next iteration.

Given the update rules:
- If `cnt[m]` is greater than or equal to `cnt[f]`, then `l` is 0 and `r` is 1.
- Otherwise, `l` remains 1 and `r` remains 2.

Since the condition `r > l + 1` is true with the current values, we need to ensure that this condition remains true even after the updates.

If `cnt[m]` is greater than or equal to `cnt[f]`, then `l` becomes 0 and `r` becomes 1. In this case, `r > l + 1` would become `1 > 0 + 1`, which is false. Therefore, this scenario would terminate the loop.

Otherwise, if `cnt[m]` is less than `cnt[f]`, then `l` remains 1 and `r` remains 2. In this case, `r > l + 1` remains `2 > 1`, which is true.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cnt[m]` must be less than `cnt[f]`.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is:
- `l` remains 1
- `r` remains 2
- `cnt[m]` must be less than `cnt[f]`

State: **`l` is 1, `r` is 2, and `cnt[m]` must be less than `cnt[f]`**
