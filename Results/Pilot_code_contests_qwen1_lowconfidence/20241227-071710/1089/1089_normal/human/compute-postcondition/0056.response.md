Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is 2, `m` is 1**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `l` is 0 and `r` is 2, satisfying the condition `r > l + 1`.
- The code calculates `m` using the formula `m = (r + l) // 2`.
- Substituting the values, `m = (2 + 0) // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1`.
- Therefore, `m` is updated to 1.
- The other variables remain unchanged.
