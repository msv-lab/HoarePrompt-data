`r` is assigned the value of `m`, which is 1. The value of `l` and the condition regarding `cnt[m]` and `cnt[f]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is 1, `r` is 1, and `cnt[m]` must be less than `cnt[f]`; `m` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is 1, and `cnt[m]` must be less than `cnt[f]`; `m` is 1**
