The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly listed in its definition. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function might operate on some external data or inputs not explicitly passed as arguments. The constraints indicate that there should be an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), two integers `a` and `b` such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\), and a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'. 

Given the provided output cases are not specified, we can infer that the function might return a specific value or condition based on the string and possibly the values of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates on an integer `n`, two integers `a` and `b`, and a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.**
