You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Snuke and Ciel went to a strange stationery store. Each of them got a transparent graph paper with H rows and W columns.

Snuke painted some of the cells red in his paper. Here, the cells painted red were 4-connected, that is, it was possible to traverse from any red cell to any other red cell, by moving to vertically or horizontally adjacent red cells only.

Ciel painted some of the cells blue in her paper. Here, the cells painted blue were 4-connected.

Afterwards, they precisely overlaid the two sheets in the same direction. Then, the intersection of the red cells and the blue cells appeared purple.

You are given a matrix of letters a_{ij} (1≤i≤H, 1≤j≤W) that describes the positions of the purple cells. If the cell at the i-th row and j-th column is purple, then a_{ij} is `#`, otherwise a_{ij} is `.`. Here, it is guaranteed that no outermost cell is purple. That is, if i=1, H or j = 1, W, then a_{ij} is `.`.

Find a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation described. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Constraints

* 3≤H,W≤500
* a_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* If i=1,H or j=1,W, then a_{ij} is `.`.
* At least one of a_{ij} is `#`.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
a_{11}...a_{1W}
:
a_{H1}...a_{HW}


Output

Print a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation, as follows:

* The first H lines should describe the positions of the red cells.
* The following 1 line should be empty.
* The following H lines should describe the positions of the blue cells.



The description of the positions of the red or blue cells should follow the format of the description of the positions of the purple cells.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: H and W are integers such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500, and a_{ij} is either `#` or `.`. Additionally, a_{ij} is `.` for cells where i=1, H or j=1, W, and at least one a_{ij} is `#`.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    red = []
    blue = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = raw_input()
        
        r = ['#']
        
        b = ['.']
        
        for j in range(1, m - 1):
            if row[j] == '#':
                r.append('#')
                b.append('#')
            elif i % 2 == 0:
                r.append('#')
                b.append('.')
            else:
                r.append('.')
                b.append('#')
        
        r.append('.')
        
        b.append('#')
        
        red.append(''.join(r))
        
        blue.append(''.join(b))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `r` is a list of length `m` where the first element is `'#'` and the last element is `'.'`, `b` is a list of length `m` where the first two elements are `'.', '#'`, `red` is a list containing strings of length `m` (each constructed from alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `blue` is a list containing strings of length `m` (each constructed from alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `i` is `n-1`, `row` is the input string from the last iteration of the loop, `j` is `m-2` if `i` is even, or `m-3` if `i` is odd.
    for r in red:
        print(r)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `red` is a list of strings of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`, each element of `red` is printed exactly once during the loop, `i` is -1, `r` is the last element of the list `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `row` is the last printed string `r`, `j` is `m-2`.
    for b in blue:
        print(b)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `blue` is a non-empty list, `red` is a list of strings of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`, each element of `red` is printed exactly once during the loop, `i` is the index of the last printed element in `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `r` is the last element of the list `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `row` is the last printed string `r`, `j` is `m-2`, `b` is the last printed element from the `blue` list.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
