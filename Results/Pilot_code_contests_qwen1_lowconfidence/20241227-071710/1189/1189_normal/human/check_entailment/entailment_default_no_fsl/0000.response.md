Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly generate the red and blue cells based on the problem description. Specifically, the code generates patterns that do not ensure the red cells are 4-connected and the blue cells are 4-connected. 

- For the red cells, the code alternates between `'#'` and `'.'` based on whether the row index \(i\) is even or odd. This means that red cells will be placed in a checkerboard pattern, which is not necessarily 4-connected. For example, consider the following input:
  ```
  5 5
  .....
  .#.#.
  .....
  .#.#.
  .....
  ```
  The expected output for red cells would be a 4-connected set of `#`s, but the code generates a checkerboard pattern instead:
  ```
  .....
  #####
  #....
  #####
  .....
  ```
  This pattern does not guarantee that there is a path from any red cell to any other red cell through adjacent red cells only.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of generating 4-connected sets of red and blue cells, making it incorrect.
