Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not generate sets of red and blue cells that are 4-connected, as required by the problem description. Specifically, the generated red and blue grids alternate between `'#'` and `'.'` based on the row index, which does not guarantee that the red cells or blue cells are 4-connected. For example, consider the following input:

```
5 5
.....
.#.#.
.....
.#.#.
.....
```

The generated red and blue grids would look like this:

Red:
```
.....
#####
#....
#####
.....
```

Blue:
```
.....
.###.
.#.#.
.###.
.....
```

In the red grid, the cells in the second and fourth rows are not 4-connected because there is a gap between them. Similarly, in the blue grid, the cells in the second and fourth rows are not 4-connected. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
