Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the positions of the red and blue cells does not ensure that the red cells form a 4-connected component. The current implementation alternates the placement of red and blue cells in a way that does not guarantee connectivity among the red cells.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
.....
.#.#.
.....
.#.#.
.....
```

The output of the program would be:
```
.....
#####
#....
#####
.....

.###.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.....
```

In this case, the red cells do not form a 4-connected component because there is no path from the top-left red cell to the bottom-right red cell using only adjacent red cells. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirement that the red cells must be 4-connected.
