You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Snuke and Ciel went to a strange stationery store. Each of them got a transparent graph paper with H rows and W columns.

Snuke painted some of the cells red in his paper. Here, the cells painted red were 4-connected, that is, it was possible to traverse from any red cell to any other red cell, by moving to vertically or horizontally adjacent red cells only.

Ciel painted some of the cells blue in her paper. Here, the cells painted blue were 4-connected.

Afterwards, they precisely overlaid the two sheets in the same direction. Then, the intersection of the red cells and the blue cells appeared purple.

You are given a matrix of letters a_{ij} (1≤i≤H, 1≤j≤W) that describes the positions of the purple cells. If the cell at the i-th row and j-th column is purple, then a_{ij} is `#`, otherwise a_{ij} is `.`. Here, it is guaranteed that no outermost cell is purple. That is, if i=1, H or j = 1, W, then a_{ij} is `.`.

Find a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation described. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Constraints

* 3≤H,W≤500
* a_{ij} is `#` or `.`.
* If i=1,H or j=1,W, then a_{ij} is `.`.
* At least one of a_{ij} is `#`.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
a_{11}...a_{1W}
:
a_{H1}...a_{HW}


Output

Print a pair of the set of the positions of the red cells and the blue cells that is consistent with the situation, as follows:

* The first H lines should describe the positions of the red cells.
* The following 1 line should be empty.
* The following H lines should describe the positions of the blue cells.



The description of the positions of the red or blue cells should follow the format of the description of the positions of the purple cells.

Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    red = []
    blue = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = raw_input()
        r = ['#']
        b = ['.']
        for j in range(1, m - 1):
            if row[j] == '#':
                r.append('#')
                b.append('#')
            elif i % 2 == 0:
                r.append('#')
                b.append('.')
            else:
                r.append('.')
                b.append('#')
        r.append('.')
        b.append('#')
        red.append(''.join(r))
        blue.append(''.join(b))
    for r in red:
        print(r)
    for b in blue:
        print(b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not ensure that the red cells are 4-connected. Specifically, the program alternates between placing red and blue cells in a checkerboard pattern, which does not guarantee that the red cells form a 4-connected component. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5 5
.....
.#.#.
.....
.#.#.
.....
```

The output of the program would be:
```
.....
#####
#....
#####
.....

.###.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.#.#.
.....
```

In this case, the red cells are not 4-connected because it is not possible to move from the top-left red cell to the bottom-right red cell using only horizontal and vertical moves through red cells. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement that the red cells must form a 4-connected component.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: H and W are integers such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500, and a_{ij} is either `#` or `.`. Additionally, a_{ij} is `.` for cells where i=1, H or j=1, W, and at least one a_{ij} is `#`.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    red = []
    blue = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = raw_input()
        
        r = ['#']
        
        b = ['.']
        
        for j in range(1, m - 1):
            if row[j] == '#':
                r.append('#')
                b.append('#')
            elif i % 2 == 0:
                r.append('#')

        r.append('.')
        
        b.append('#')

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `r` is a list of length `m` where the first element is `'#'` and the last element is `'.'`, `b` is a list of length `m` where the first two elements are `'.', '#'`, `red` is a list containing strings of length `m` (each constructed from alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `blue` is a list containing strings of length `m` (each constructed from alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `i` is `n-1`, `row` is the input string from the last iteration of the loop, `j` is `m-2` if `i` is even, or `m-3` if `i` is odd.
    for r in red:
        print(r)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `red` is a list of strings of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`, each element of `red` is printed exactly once during the loop, `i` is -1, `r` is the last element of the list `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `row` is the last printed string `r`, `j` is `m-2`.
    for b in blue:
        print(b)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `blue` is a non-empty list, `red` is a list of strings of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`, each element of `red` is printed exactly once during the loop, `i` is the index of the last printed element in `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `r` is the last element of the list `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `row` is the last printed string `r`, `j` is `m-2`, `b` is the last printed element from the `blue` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 3 \leq n, m \leq 500 \)), and generates two \( n \times m \) grids, one representing "red" and the other representing "blue". Each grid is filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'` characters based on the row index \( i \) modulo 2. The function then prints each row of both grids sequentially. The red grid starts with `'#'` and ends with `'.'`, while the blue grid starts with `'.'` and ends with `'#'`. If \( i \) is even, the corresponding row in the red grid contains `'#'` followed by alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, and in the blue grid, it contains `'.'` followed by alternating `'#'` and `'#'`. If \( i \) is odd, the patterns are reversed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
