The code appends `'#'` to the list `b`. Initially, `b` is `['.']`. After appending `'#'`, `b` becomes `['.', '#']`.

The other variables (`j`, `r`, `red`, `blue`, `i`, `row`, and the current value of `row[j]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `r` is `['#', '#']`; `red` is `['#', '[]']`; `blue` is `['[.]']`; `i` is `n-1`; `row` is a string input from the user; `b` is `['.', '#']`; and the current value of `row[j]` is `'#'`**.
