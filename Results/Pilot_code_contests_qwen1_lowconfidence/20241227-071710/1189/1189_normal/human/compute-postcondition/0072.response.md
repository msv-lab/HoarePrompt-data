The code `r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and the condition `3 < m-1` ensures that `m` is greater than 4. Therefore, the only change is in the list `r`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 4, `j` is 3, `r` is a list with the last element being `'#'`**
