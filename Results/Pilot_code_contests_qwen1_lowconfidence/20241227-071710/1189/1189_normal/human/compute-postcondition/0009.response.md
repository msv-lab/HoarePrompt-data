`r` is appended with the value `#`. The value of `m` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `row[j]` is `#`. After executing the code, the list `r` will include the element `#`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than 2; the current value of `row[j]` is `#`; `r` is now a list containing `#`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2; the current value of `row[j]` is `#`; `r` is a list containing `#`.**
