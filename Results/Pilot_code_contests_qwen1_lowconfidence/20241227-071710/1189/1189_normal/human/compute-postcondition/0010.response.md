`b` is appended with the value `'#'`. The value of `row[j]` is `'#'` and it remains unchanged. The list `r` contains `'#'` and also remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is in the list `b`, which now includes `'#'`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2; the current value of `row[j]` is `#`; `r` is a list containing `#`; `b` is a list containing `#`**
