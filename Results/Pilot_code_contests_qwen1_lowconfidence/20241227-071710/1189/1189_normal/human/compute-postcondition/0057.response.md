`b` is assigned the value `#` and appended to the list `b`. The value of `m` being greater than 1 and the element at index `j` in the list `row` not being equal to `'#'` remain unchanged. The list `r` has an additional element `'.'` appended to it, which also remains unchanged except for the new element added.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, the element at index `j` in the list `row` is not equal to `'#'`, the list `r` has an additional element `'.'` appended to it, and the list `b` now includes the element `#`.**
