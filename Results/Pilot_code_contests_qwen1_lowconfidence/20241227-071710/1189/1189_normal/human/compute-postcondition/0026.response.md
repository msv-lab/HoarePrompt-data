`b` is appended with the value `'#'`. The initial state does not provide the exact content of `r`, only that it contains `'.'`. The value of `r` itself is not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is in the list `b`.

Output State: **`r` is a list containing the elements of its original content plus `'.'`, `b` is the list `b` with `'#'` appended to it.**
