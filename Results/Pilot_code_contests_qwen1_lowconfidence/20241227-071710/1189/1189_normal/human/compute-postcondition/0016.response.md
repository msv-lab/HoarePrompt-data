`r.append('.')` appends a period ('.') to the list `r`. This operation does not affect the values of `m`, `row[j]`, or the condition `(i % 2 != 0)`. Therefore, the only change is in the list `r`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `row[j]` is not equal to '#', `(i % 2 != 0)`, `r` is a list with an additional element '.' appended to it.**
