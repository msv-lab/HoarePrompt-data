Postcondition: **`m` is greater than 1. If the element at index `j` in the list `row` is `'#'`, then `r` is `['#']` and `b` is `['#']`. If the element at index `j` in the list `row` is not `'#'`, and if the current value of `i` is even, then `r` has an additional `'#'` appended to it, and `b` contains the element `'.'`. Otherwise, `r` has an additional `'.'` appended to it, and `b` now includes the element `#`.**
