`blue.append(''.join(b))` appends a string created by joining the elements of the list `b` to the end of the list `blue`. Given the initial state:

- `b` is a list of length `m` with the first two elements being `'.', '#'`.
- `blue` is `['[.]']`.

When we join the elements of `b`, it results in the string `'.#'`. This string is then appended to `blue`.

Therefore, the updated state of `blue` is `['[.]', '.#']`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `m-2`, `r` is a list of length `m` with the first element being `'#'` and the last element being `'.'`, `red` is `['#', '[]', ..., r[1], r[2], ..., r[m-2], r[m-1], '.']`, `blue` is `['[.]', '.#']`, `i` is `n-1`, `row` is a string input from the user, `b` is a list of length `m` with the first two elements being `'.', '#'`.**
