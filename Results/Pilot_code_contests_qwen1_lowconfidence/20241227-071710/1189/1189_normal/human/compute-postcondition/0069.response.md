Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `m-1`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.

4. **Check Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m-1`.
   - Since `j` is now 3, we need to check if `3 < m-1`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to 3.
   - The condition `3 < m-1` must hold true, meaning `m` must be greater than 4 (since `m-1 > 3` implies `m > 4`).

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `m` must be greater than 4.
- `j` is 3.

State: **`m` is greater than 4, `j` is 3**
