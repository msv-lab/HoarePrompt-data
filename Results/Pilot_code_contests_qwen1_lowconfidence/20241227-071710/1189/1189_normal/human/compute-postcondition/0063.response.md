The code `r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. Since `r` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume that `r` is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'#'` to `r`, the list `r` will contain `['#']`.

The variables `m` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is 2; `r` is ['#']**
