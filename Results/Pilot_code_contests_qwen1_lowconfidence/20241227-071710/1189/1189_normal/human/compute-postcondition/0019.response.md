Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 2. If `row[j]` equals `'#'`, then `r` is a list containing `#` and `b` is a list containing `#`. Otherwise, `row[j]` does not equal `'#'`. If `i` is even, `r` is a list with an additional `#` appended, and `b` contains `'.'`. If `i` is odd, `r` is a list with an additional `'.'` appended, and `b` contains `'#'`***.
