`b` is appended with the value `'#'`. The initial state of `b` was such that it contained all its original elements plus `'.'` if `row[k+1]` was `'#'`, or `'.'` if `row[k+1]` was not `'#'`. After appending `'#'`, the new state of `b` will include the additional `'#'`.

Output State: **`r` is a list and contains all its original elements plus '.', `b` is a list containing all its original elements plus '#'**
