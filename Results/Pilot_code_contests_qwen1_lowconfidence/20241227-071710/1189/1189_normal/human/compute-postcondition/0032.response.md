`r` is a list and `b` is a list. If `row[k+1]` is `'#'`, then `r` contains all its original elements plus `'#'`, and `b` remains as a list containing `'.'`. If `row[k+1]` is not `'#'`, then `r` contains all its original elements plus `'.'`, and `b` contains all its original elements plus `'#'`.

The code snippet `r.append('#')` appends the value `'#'` to the list `r`. Since the condition for appending `'#'` or `'.'` to `r` and `b` respectively is based on the value of `row[k+1]`, and the code does not specify this value, we assume that the condition for appending `'#'` to `r` has been met.

Therefore, the updated state of `r` is that it contains all its original elements plus `'#'`, and `b` remains unchanged as a list containing `'.'`.

Output State: **`r` is a list containing all its original elements plus `'#'`, `b` is a list containing `'.'`**
