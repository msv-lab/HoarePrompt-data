The code `b.append('#')` appends the character `'#'` to the list `b`. Initially, `b` is not defined in the given state, so it will be created as an empty list and then the character `'#'` will be appended to it. The values of `m`, `j`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 4; `j` is 3; `r` is ['.']; `b` is `['#']`**
