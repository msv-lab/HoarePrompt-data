The code appends `'#'` to the list `r`. Since `row[j]` is initially `'#'`, appending `'#'` to `r` means `r` now contains `'#'`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `m` must be greater than 1; the current value of `row[j]` is `'#'`; `r` is `['#']`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; the current value of `row[j]` is `'#'`; `r` is `['#']`**
