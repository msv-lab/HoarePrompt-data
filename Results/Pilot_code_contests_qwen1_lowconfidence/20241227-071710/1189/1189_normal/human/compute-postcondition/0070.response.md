The code `r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. Since no initial value for `r` is provided, we can assume `r` is a list. The length of `r` increases by one due to the append operation. The values of `m` and `j` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 4, `j` is 3, `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'` appended to it.**
