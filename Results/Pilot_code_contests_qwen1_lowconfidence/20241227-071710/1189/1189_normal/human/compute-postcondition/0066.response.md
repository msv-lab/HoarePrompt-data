`b` is appended with the value `'#'`. Since `b` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a list (based on the example of `r` being a list). The initial value of `b` is not given, so it remains unchanged except for the new element added.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is 2; `r` is ['."'], `b` is a list containing `'#'`**
