The code `r.append('.')` adds a single element `'.'` to the list `r`. The list `b` remains unchanged because no operation on `b` is mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is a list and includes all its original elements plus `'.'`, and `b` is a list containing all its original elements plus `'#'` if `row[k+1]` was `'#'`, or `b` is a list containing all its original elements plus `'.'` if `row[k+1]` was not `'#'`.

However, since the exact condition for `row[k+1]` is not changing due to this code snippet, we will keep the original conditions as they are but reflect the change in `r`.

Output State: **`r` is a list and contains all its original elements plus `'.'`, and `b` is a list containing all its original elements plus `'#'` if `row[k+1]` was `'#'`, or `b` is a list containing all its original elements plus `'.'` if `row[k+1]` was not `'#'`.**
