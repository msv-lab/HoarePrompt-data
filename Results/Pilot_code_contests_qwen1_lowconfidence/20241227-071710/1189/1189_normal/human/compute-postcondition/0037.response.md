Postcondition: ***`r` and `b` are lists. If `row[j]` is `'#'`, then `r` contains all its original elements plus `'#'` and `b` contains all its original elements plus `'.'`. Otherwise, if `i % 2 == 0`, `r` contains all its original elements plus `'#'` and `b` contains all its original elements plus `'#'`. If `i % 2 != 0`, `r` contains all its original elements plus `'.'` and `b` contains all its original elements plus `'#'`.***
