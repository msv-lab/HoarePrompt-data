`r` is a list of length `m - 1` where each element is either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions. The code appends a `.` to the list `r`. The length of `r` becomes `m`.

Output State: **`r` is a list of length `m`, where the last element is `'.`' and the first `m-1` elements are either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions; `b` is a list of length `m - 1` where each element is either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions.**
