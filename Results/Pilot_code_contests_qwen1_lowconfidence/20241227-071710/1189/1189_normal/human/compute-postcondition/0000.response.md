The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since the initial state specifies that `H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ H, W ≤ 500, and a_{ij} is either `#` or `.` with the additional constraints, the values of `H` and `W` remain unchanged. However, the variables `n` and `m` are now assigned the values of the integers read from input.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ W ≤ 500, a_{ij} is `#` or `.` for cells where i=1, H or j=1, W, and at least one a_{ij} is `#`; `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input**
