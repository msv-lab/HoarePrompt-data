The code `b.append('.')` adds a period (`'.'`) to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not mention any list named `b`, only a list named `r` which contains its original elements plus `'#'`.

Since the list `b` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is a new list being initialized within the context of this code snippet. After appending `'.'` to `b`, the list `b` will contain at least one element, which is `'.'`.

Output State: **`r` is a list containing its original elements plus `'#'`; `b` is a list containing `'.'`**
