Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes all its iterations.

### Initial State
- `r = ['#']`
- `b = ['.']`
- `row` is an input string from `raw_input()`
- `red = [<previous value of red>, ['#']]`
- `blue` has an additional element which is either `'.#'`, `'.#. '`, or `'... '` (let's denote this as `blue_add`)
- `i` is `n` (where `n` is the length of `row`)

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(1, m - 1):
    if row[j] == '#':
        r.append('#')
        b.append('#')
    elif i % 2 == 0:
        r.append('#')
        b.append('.')
    else:
        r.append('.')
        b.append('#')
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = m - 2` (since `range(1, m - 1)`).
- The condition inside the loop depends on the character at position `j` in `row` and the parity of `i`.

### Key Observations
- If `row[j] == '#'`, both `r` and `b` append `'#'`.
- If `i % 2 == 0`, `r` appends `'#'` and `b` appends `'. '`.
- If `i % 2 != 0`, `r` appends `'.'` and `b` appends `'#'`.

### Final State After All Iterations
- Since the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = m - 2`, it will append to `r` and `b` `m - 2` times.
- The final state of `r` and `b` will depend on the number of times each condition is met during the loop iterations.

#### Detailed Steps:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `r = ['#']`
   - `b = ['.']`
   - `blue_add` is one of `'.#'`, `'.#. '`, or `'... '`.

2. **After First Iteration (j=1)**:
   - If `row[1] == '#'`, then `r = ['#', '#']` and `b = ['#', '#']`.
   - If `row[1] != '#'` and `i % 2 == 0`, then `r = ['#', '#']` and `b = ['#', '.']`.
   - If `row[1] != '#'` and `i % 2 != 0`, then `r = ['#', '.']` and `b = ['#', '#']`.

3. **After Second Iteration (j=2)**:
   - If `row[2] == '#'`, then `r = ['#', '#', '#']` and `b = ['#', '#', '#']`.
   - If `row[2] != '#'` and `i % 2 == 0`, then `r = ['#', '#', '#']` and `b = ['#', '.', '.']`.
   - If `row[2] != '#'` and `i % 2 != 0`, then `r = ['#', '#', '.']` and `b = ['#', '#', '#']`.

4. **General Pattern**:
   - The pattern continues such that `r` will have `m - 1` elements, and `b` will have `m - 1` elements.
   - Depending on the conditions, `r` and `b` will have a mix of `'#'` and `'.'`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `r` will be a list of length `m - 1` where each element is either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions.
   - `b` will be a list of length `m - 1` where each element is either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions.
   - The exact composition of `r` and `b` depends on the characters in `row` and the parity of `i`.

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations is:

Output State: **`r` is a list of length `m - 1` where each element is either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions, `b` is a list of length `m - 1` where each element is either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions.**
