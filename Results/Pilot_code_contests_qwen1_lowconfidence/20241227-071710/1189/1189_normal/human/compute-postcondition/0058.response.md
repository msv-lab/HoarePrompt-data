Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, and the element at index `j` in the list `row` is not equal to `'#'`. If the current value of `i` is even, the list `r` has an additional element `'#'` appended to it, and the list `b` contains the element `.`. Otherwise, the list `r` has an additional element `'.'` appended to it, and the list `b` now includes the element `#`.***
