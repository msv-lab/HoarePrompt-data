Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `r` is a list containing a sequence of `'#'`, `'. '` (space), or `' '` (space).
  - `b` is a list containing either `['.', '#']` or `['.', '.', '#']` or `['.', '.', '.']`.
  - `row` is an input string from `raw_input()`.
  - `red` is a list containing `<previous value of red>` and `''.join(r)`.
  - `blue` has an additional element which is either `'.#'`, `'.#. '` (space), or `'... '` (space).

- **For Loop:**
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:** The loop condition `for i in range(n)` implies that the loop will run `n` times.
2. **Variables to Consider:**
   - `i`: The loop counter.
   - `n`: The number of iterations specified by `range(n)`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **At the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` would be `n-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`).
  - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`i`:** Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` should be `n` (the current value of `i` plus 1).
- **`n`:** `n` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but typically `n` is a constant specified before the loop starts.
- **Other Variables (`r`, `b`, `row`, `red`, `blue`):** These variables remain the same unless the loop body changes them. Since the problem does not mention any changes within the loop body, these values remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
- The only change needed is to update `i` to `n`.

### Final State:
- `i` becomes `n`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `r`, `b`, `row`, `red`, and `blue` remain the same.

### Final Answer:
State: **`r` is `['#', ... , '#' or '.' or ' ']`, `b` is `['.', '#']` or `['.', '.']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'`, `row` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `red` is `[<previous value of red>, ''.join(r)]`, `blue` has an additional element which is either `'.#'`, `'.#. '`, or `'... '`, `i` is `n`**.
