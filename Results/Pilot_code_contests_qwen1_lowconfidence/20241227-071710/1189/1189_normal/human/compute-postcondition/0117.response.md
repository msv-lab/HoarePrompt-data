Postcondition: **`j` is 3, `r` is a list starting with `'#'` followed by elements from the original list `r`, `red` is `['#', '[]']`, `blue` is `['[.]']`, `i` is `n-1`, `row` is a string input from the user, and `b` is a list based on the condition in the if statement. If the condition in the if statement is true (`row[j] == '#'`), then `r` is modified such that it becomes `['#', '#', '#', '#']`, `['#', '.', '#', '#']`, `['#', '#', '.', '#']`, `['#', '.', '.', '#']`, or `['#', '#', '#', '.', '#']`. Otherwise, `r` has `'#'` appended to it if `i` is even, or it is modified according to specific patterns based on the original list `r` and the condition in the if statement.**
