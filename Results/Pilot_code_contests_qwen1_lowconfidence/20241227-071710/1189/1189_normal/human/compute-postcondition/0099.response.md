Postcondition: **`j` is 1; `r` is either `['#', '#']` or `['#', '.']` depending on whether `i` is even or not; `red` is `['#', '[]']`; `blue` is `['[.]']`; `i` is `n-1`; `row` is a string input from the user; `b` is `['#', '#', '.']` if `i` is even or `['#', '#']` if `i` is not even; the character at position `j` in `row` is either `'#'` or not `'#'` based on the if condition.**
