Output State: **`red` is a list of strings of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`, each element of `red` is printed exactly once during the loop, `i` is -1, `r` is the last element of the list `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `row` is the last printed string `r`, `j` is `m-2`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Loop Execution**:
   - Initially, `red` is a list of strings of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`.
   - `i` starts at `n-1` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the loop prints an element of `red`.
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `-1` because it is decremented until it reaches `-1`.
   - All elements of `red` are printed exactly once.

3. **Final Values**:
   - Since the loop prints all elements of `red` and `i` is decremented until it reaches `-1`, `i` will be `-1` after the loop.
   - `r` will be the last element of `red` because it is printed in each iteration.
   - `row` will be the last printed string, which is the last element of `red`.
   - `j` will be `m-2` if `i` was odd (since `j` is set to `m-2` if `i` is even and `m-3` if `i` is odd, but since `i` ends up being `-1` which is odd, `j` will be `m-2`).

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state of the variables will match the described output state.
