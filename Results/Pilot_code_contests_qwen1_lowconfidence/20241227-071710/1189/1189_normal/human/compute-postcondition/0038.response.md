Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `H` is an integer such that \(3 \leq H \leq 500\)
- `W` is an integer such that \(3 \leq W \leq 500\)
- `a_{ij}` is `#` or `.` for cells where \(i=1, H\) or \(j=1, W\)
- At least one `a_{ij}` is `#`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `m` is an integer read from input
- `red` is an empty list
- `blue` is an empty list
- `row` is the input string from `raw_input()`
- `r` is `['#']`
- `b` is `['.']`

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(1, m - 1):
    if row[j] == '#':
        r.append('#')
        b.append('#')
    elif i % 2 == 0:
        r.append('#')
        b.append('.')
    else:
        r.append('.')
        b.append('#')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `r` starts as `['#']`
   - `b` starts as `['.']`

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m-2` (since `m-1` is excluded).
   - For each iteration:
     - If `row[j] == '#'`, both `r` and `b` append `'#'`.
     - If `row[j] != '#'` and `i % 2 == 0`, `r` appends `'#'` and `b` appends `'.'`.
     - If `row[j] != '#'` and `i % 2 != 0`, `r` appends `'.'` and `b` appends `'#'`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `r` and `b` will be lists containing the concatenation of the operations performed in each iteration.
   - The exact contents of `r` and `b` depend on the conditions inside the loop:
     - If `row[j] == '#'`, both `r` and `b` will have an extra `'#'` for each occurrence.
     - If `row[j] != '#'` and `i % 2 == 0`, `r` will have an extra `'#'` and `b` will have an extra `'.'`.
     - If `row[j] != '#'` and `i % 2 != 0`, `r` will have an extra `'.'` and `b` will have an extra `'#'`.

4. **Special Case - No Iterations**:
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `m <= 2`), then `r` remains `['#']` and `b` remains `['.']`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is:
- `r` is a list containing `['#']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `b` is a list containing `['.']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'` based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `row` is the input string from `raw_input()`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`r` is a list starting with `['#']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on the conditions inside the loop, `b` is a list starting with `['.']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on the conditions inside the loop, `row` is the input string from `raw_input()`.**
