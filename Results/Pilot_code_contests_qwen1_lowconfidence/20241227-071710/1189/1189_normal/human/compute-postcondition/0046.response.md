The code `b = ['.']` changes the list `b` to `['.']`. The initial values of `r`, `b`, `row`, `red`, `blue`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `r` is `['#']`
- `b` is `['.']`
- `row` is the input string from `raw_input()`
- `red` is `[<previous value of red>, ''.join(r)]`, which means `red` is `[<previous value of red>, ['#']]`
- `blue` has an additional element which is either `'.#'`, `'.#. '`, or `'... '` (the specific element depends on the initial state before this line of code)
- `i` is `n`

Output State: **`r` is `['#']`, `b` is `['.']`, `row` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `red` is `[<previous value of red>, ['#']]`, `blue` has an additional element which is either `'.#'`, `'.#. '`, or `'... '`, `i` is `n`**
