The code `b.append('.')` appends the string `'.'` to the list `b`. Since `b` was not defined in the initial state, it implies that `b` is a new list created and initialized with the value `'.'` appended to it. The values of `m`, `j`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is 2; `r` is ['#']; `b` is ['.']**
