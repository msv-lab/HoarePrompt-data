`b` is appended with the value `'#'`. The value of `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `r` is a list containing `['#']`. After appending `'#'` to `b`, `b` becomes `['#']` as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `r` is a list containing `['#']`, and `b` is a list containing `['#']`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `r` is a list containing `['#']`, `b` is a list containing `['#']`**
