The code `print(b)` simply prints the value of `b`. It does not modify any of the existing variables or introduce new ones. Therefore, the only change is the print statement itself.

Output State: **`blue` is a non-empty list, `red` is a list of strings of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`, each element of `red` is printed exactly once during the loop, `i` is -1, `r` is the last element of the list `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `row` is the last printed string `r`, `j` is `m-2`, `b` is printed.**
