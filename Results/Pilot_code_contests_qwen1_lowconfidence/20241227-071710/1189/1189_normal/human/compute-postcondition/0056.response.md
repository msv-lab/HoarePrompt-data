`r` is appended with the string `'.'`. The initial state indicates that `m` must be greater than 1, and the element at index `j` in the list `row` is not equal to `'#'`. The operation does not affect these conditions or the value of `m`, but it adds a new element `'.'` to the list `r`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, the element at index `j` in the list `row` is not equal to `'#'`, and the list `r` has an additional element `'.'` appended to it.**
