The code snippet `b.append('.')` appends a period ('.') to the list `b`. Initially, `b` is `['#', '#']`. After appending '.', the list `b` becomes `['#', '#', '.']`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `j` is still 1, `r` remains `['#', '#']`, `red` remains `['#', '[]']`, `blue` remains `['[.]']`, `i` is still `n-1`, `row` remains a string input from the user, the character at position `j` in `row` is still not '#', and `i` is still even.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `r` is `['#', '#']`; `red` is `['#', '[]']`; `blue` is `['[.]']`; `i` is `n-1`; `row` is a string input from the user; the character at position `j` in `row` is not `'#'`; and `i` is even; `b` is `['#', '#', '.']`.**
