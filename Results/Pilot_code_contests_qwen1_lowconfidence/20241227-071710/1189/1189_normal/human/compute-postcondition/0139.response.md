Functionality: **The function processes input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 3 \leq n, m \leq 500 \)), and generates two \( n \times m \) grids, one representing "red" and the other representing "blue". Each grid is filled with alternating `'#'` and `'.'` characters based on the row index \( i \) modulo 2. The function then prints each row of both grids sequentially. The red grid starts with `'#'` and ends with `'.'`, while the blue grid starts with `'.'` and ends with `'#'`. If \( i \) is even, the corresponding row in the red grid contains `'#'` followed by alternating `'#'` and `'.'`, and in the blue grid, it contains `'.'` followed by alternating `'#'` and `'#'`. If \( i \) is odd, the patterns are reversed.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes valid input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) within the specified range. No checks are performed to ensure this.
- The function does not handle invalid inputs such as \( n \) or \( m \) less than 3 or greater than 500.
- The function does not provide any error handling for invalid input types; it assumes the input is always integers.
- The function does not return any value, but rather prints the generated grids directly to the console.
