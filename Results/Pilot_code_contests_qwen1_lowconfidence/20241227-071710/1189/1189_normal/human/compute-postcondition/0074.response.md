The code `r.append('.')` appends a period (`'.'`) to the list `r`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `r`, we assume `r` is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'.'`, the list `r` will contain one element, which is `'.'`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 4; `j` is 3; `r` is ['.']**
