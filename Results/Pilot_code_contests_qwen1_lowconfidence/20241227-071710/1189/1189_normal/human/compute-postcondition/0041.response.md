The code snippet `red.append(''.join(r))` appends a string created by joining all elements in the list `r` to the list `red`. Given the initial state where `r` is a list containing `'#', ... , '#' or '.' or ' '`, the impact of this code is to add a new element to the list `red`, which is a string representation of the list `r`.

Since `r` is not modified within the given code snippet, its state remains unchanged. The only change is the addition of a new element to the list `red`.

Output State: **`r` is `['#', ... , '#' or '.' or ' ']`, `b` is `['.', '#']` or `['.', '.']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on the conditions inside the loop, `row` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `red` is `[<previous value of red>, ''.join(r)]`**
