The code `r.append('.')` appends the string `'.'` to the list `r`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `r`. Since `r` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume that `r` is an empty list before this operation.

After executing `r.append('.')`, the list `r` will contain the element `'.'`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1; `j` is 2; `r` is ['."]**
