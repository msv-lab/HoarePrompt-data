`b.append('#')` appends the value `'#'` to the list `b`. Since the initial state does not define `b`, we assume `b` is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'#'` to `b`, the list `b` now contains `['#']`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged: `m` must be greater than 4, `j` is 3, and `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'` appended to it.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 4, `j` is 3, `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'` appended to it, `b` is a list containing `['#']`**
