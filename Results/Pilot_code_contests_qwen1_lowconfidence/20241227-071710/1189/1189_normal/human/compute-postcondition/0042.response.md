The code appends `b` joined into a string to the list `blue`. The initial state provides us with the following information:

- `r` is a list containing characters which can be `'#'`, `'. '` or `' '`.
- `b` is either `['.', '#']` or `['.', '.']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'`.
- `row` is an input string obtained using `raw_input()`.
- `red` is a list containing the previous value of `red` and the joined version of `r`.

Since `b` can be either `['.', '#']` or `['.', '.']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'`, let's consider both cases:

1. If `b` is `['.', '#']`:
   - The last element of `blue` is updated to `['.', '#']` joined into a string, which is `'.#'`.

2. If `b` is `['.', '.']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'`:
   - The last element of `blue` is updated to `['.', '.', '#']` or `['.', '.', '.']` joined into a string, which is `'.#. '` or `'... '`.

The variables `r`, `b`, `row`, and `red` remain unaffected in terms of their values, but `blue` is modified by appending the joined string of `b`.

Output State: **`r` is `['#', ... , '#' or '.' or ' ']`, `b` is `['.', '#']` or `['.', '.']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'`, `row` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `red` is `[<previous value of red>, ''.join(r)]`, `blue` has an additional element which is either `'.#'`, `'.#. '`, or `'... '`**.
