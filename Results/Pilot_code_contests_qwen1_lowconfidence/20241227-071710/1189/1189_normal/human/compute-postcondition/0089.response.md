`r` appends the value `'#'` to itself. The original value of `r` is `['#']`, so after appending, `r` becomes `['#', '#']`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1; `r` is `['#', '#']`; `red` is `['#', '[]']`; `blue` is `['[.]']`; `i` is `n-1`; `row` is a string input from the user; `b` is `['.']`; and the current value of `row[j]` is `'#'`.
