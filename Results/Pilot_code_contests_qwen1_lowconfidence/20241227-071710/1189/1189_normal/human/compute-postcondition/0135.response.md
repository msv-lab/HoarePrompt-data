Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `blue` is a non-empty list.
   - `red` is a list of strings of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`.
   - Each element of `red` is printed exactly once during the loop.
   - `i` is -1.
   - `r` is the last element of the list `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`).
   - `row` is the last printed string `r`.
   - `j` is `m-2`.
   - `b` is printed.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the `blue` list.
   - The initial value of `i` is -1, indicating the starting point before the first iteration.
   - The loop variable `b` takes values from the `blue` list.

3. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was -1 at the end of the previous iteration, it means we have just started the loop.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - `b` will now take the next value from the `blue` list.
   - `r` will be updated to the next element in the `red` list.
   - `row` will be updated to the last printed string `r`.
   - `j` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `b` will be printed again in the next iteration.

4. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 0 (incremented by 1 from -1).
   - `b` will be the next element from the `blue` list.
   - `r` will be the next element from the `red` list.
   - `row` will be the last printed string `r`.

Given these observations, the new states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`blue` is a non-empty list, `red` is a list of strings of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`, each element of `red` is printed exactly once during the loop, `i` is 0, `r` is the next element of the list `red` (which is a string of length `m` containing alternating `'#'` and `'.'` based on `i % 2`), `row` is the last printed string `r`, `j` is `m-2`, `b` is the next element from the `blue` list**
