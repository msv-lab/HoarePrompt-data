Postcondition: **`m` is greater than 4, `j` is 3. If `row[j] == '#'`, then `r` is a list with an additional `'#'` appended to it, and `b` is a list containing `['#']`. Otherwise, if `i % 2 == 0`, `r` is a list with the last element being `'#'` and `b` is a list containing `'.'`. Otherwise, `r` is `['.']` and `b` is `['#']`.**
