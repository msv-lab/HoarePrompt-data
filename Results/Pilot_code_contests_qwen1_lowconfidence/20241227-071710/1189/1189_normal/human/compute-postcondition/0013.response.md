`r.append('#')` adds the string `'#'` to the list `r`. The initial conditions state that `m` must be greater than 2, `row[j]` is not equal to `'#'`, and the current value of `i` is even. These conditions are not directly affected by the operation `r.append('#')`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `row[j]` is not equal to `'#'`, the current value of `i` is even, `r` is a list with an additional element `'#'` appended to it.**
