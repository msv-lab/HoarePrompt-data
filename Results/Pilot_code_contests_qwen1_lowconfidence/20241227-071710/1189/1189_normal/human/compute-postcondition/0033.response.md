The code snippet `b.append('.')` appends the string `'.'` to the list `b`. The list `b` originally contains the element `'.'`. After appending, `b` will contain two elements: `'.'` and `'.'`.

The list `r` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`r` is a list containing all its original elements plus '#', `b` is a list containing '`.`' and '`.`'**
