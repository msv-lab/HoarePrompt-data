The code `r.append('#')` adds the element `'#'` to the list `r`. The list `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `r` includes the additional element `'#'`, and `b` retains its original elements with an additional `'#'`.

Output State: **`r` is a list and includes all its original elements plus `'#'`; `b` is a list and includes all its original elements plus `'#'`.**
