Postcondition: **`r` is a list and `b` is a list. If `row[j]` is `'#'`, then `r` contains all its original elements plus `'#'`, and `b` remains as a list containing `'.'`. If `row[j]` is not `'#'`, then `r` contains all its original elements plus `'.'`, and `b` contains all its original elements plus `'#'`.**
