The code `b.append('.')` appends a period (`'.'`) to the list `b`. Since the initial state does not specify what `b` is, we assume `b` is an empty list initially. However, the initial state provides information about `m`, `j`, and `r`.

After the code execution:
- `m` remains greater than 4.
- `j` remains 3.
- `r` remains a list with the last element being `'#'`.
- `b` becomes a list containing `'.'`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 4, `j` is 3, `r` is a list with the last element being `'#'`, `b` is a list containing `'.'`**
