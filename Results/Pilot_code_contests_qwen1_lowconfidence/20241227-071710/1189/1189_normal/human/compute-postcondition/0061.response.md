The code `r.append('#')` adds the string `'#'` to the list `r`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `r`. Since `r` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a list (or will become a list) before executing the code.

After the code runs, the list `r` will contain the element `'#'`. The values of `m` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `r` is a list containing ['#']**
