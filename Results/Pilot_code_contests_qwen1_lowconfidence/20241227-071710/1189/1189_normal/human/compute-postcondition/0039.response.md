The code `r.append('.')` adds a single period (`'.'`) to the end of the list `r`. The initial state of `r` is `['#']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on the conditions inside the loop. After appending `'.'`, the list `r` will now end with `'.'`.

The states of the other variables, `b` and `row`, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`r` is `['#', ... , '#' or '.', '.']`, `b` is a list starting with `['.']` followed by either `'#'` or `'.'` depending on the conditions inside the loop, `row` is the input string from `raw_input()`**
