`r.append('#')` appends the string `'#'` to the list `r`. Since the initial state does not specify what `r` is, we assume it is a list. After executing this line of code, the list `r` will contain whatever elements it originally had plus the new element `'#'`.

Output State: **`r` is a list containing its original elements plus `'#'`**
