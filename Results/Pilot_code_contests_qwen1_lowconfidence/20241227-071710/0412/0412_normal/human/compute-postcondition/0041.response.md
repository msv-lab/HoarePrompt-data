Output State: **`input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is less than `d`, `j` is the last index where `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` was greater than or equal to `d`, `partial_sum` is decreased by the sum of all `input_list[j][1]` values from the start index `j` to the final index `j`.** 

Explanation:
1. The loop continues as long as the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` holds true.
2. With each iteration, `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]` and `j` is incremented by 1.
3. The loop terminates when the condition no longer holds, i.e., `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] < d`.
4. At the end of the loop, `j` will be the index right after the last valid position where the condition was met.
5. `partial_sum` will be the updated value after subtracting the sum of elements in the specified range.
