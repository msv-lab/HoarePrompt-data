`partial_sum` is decreased by the value of `input_list[j][1]`. The value of `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`, and `j` is increased by 1. After executing the code, the value of `j` is updated to `j + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`, `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`, `j` is increased by 1 to `j + 1`**
