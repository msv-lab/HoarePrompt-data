The code sorts the `input_list` based on its tuples. The initial state is defined such that `n` is the first element of `read_input`, `d` is the second element of `read_input`, `read_input` contains `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers are `mi` values, the last `d` integers are `si` values, `input_list` is a list of tuples consisting of two integers, and `i` is equal to `n`.

After sorting `input_list`, the order of the tuples in `input_list` will be based on their first elements (the `mi` values). However, the exact values and order of the `mi` and `si` values are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact sorted order.

The only variable that has been affected by the code is `input_list`, which is now sorted. The other variables (`n`, `d`, `read_input`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to `input_list` during the loop iterations, `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, `i` is `n`.**
