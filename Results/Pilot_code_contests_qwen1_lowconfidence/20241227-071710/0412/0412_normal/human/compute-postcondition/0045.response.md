Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is less than `d`.
- `j` is the last index where `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` was greater than or equal to `d`.
- `partial_sum` is increased by `input_list[i+1][1]` (if the condition holds).
- `max_factor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition in the Loop**: The loop will continue as long as `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is greater than or equal to `d`.
2. **Current State**: According to the given state, `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is already less than `d`, meaning the condition in the loop is not satisfied at the start.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` becomes greater than or equal to `d`.

### Required Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is no longer less than `d`. This means we need to set `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` to be greater than or equal to `d`.

### New State:
- `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`**
