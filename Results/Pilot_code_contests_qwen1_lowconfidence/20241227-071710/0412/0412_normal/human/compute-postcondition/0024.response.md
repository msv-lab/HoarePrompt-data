`i` is `n`, which means `i` was originally set to the value of `n`. The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was initially set to 1, after this operation, `j` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to `input_list` during the loop iterations, `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, `i` is `n`, `max_factor` is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`, `partial_sum` is `max_factor - input_list[0][1] - input_list[1][1]`, `j` is 2, and `input_list[n][0] - input_list[1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.**
