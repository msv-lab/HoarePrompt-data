The code snippet `read_input = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads input from the user and splits it into individual components, converting each component into an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `read_input`. However, the original values of `n` and `d` are not affected by this operation.

Let's assume the input provided by the user is `n` integers for `mi` and `d` integers for `si`. For simplicity, let's denote these as `mi1, mi2, ..., min` and `s1, s2, ..., sd` respectively, where `min` and `d` are the number of friends.

After executing the code, the `read_input` variable will contain `n + d` integers starting with `n` values corresponding to `mi` and followed by `d` values corresponding to `si`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5, and `d` is an integer such that `d` > 0; `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values.**
