`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must still be greater than or equal to `d`, and `partial_sum` is still decreased by `input_list[j][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`, `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`, `j` is increased by 1.**
