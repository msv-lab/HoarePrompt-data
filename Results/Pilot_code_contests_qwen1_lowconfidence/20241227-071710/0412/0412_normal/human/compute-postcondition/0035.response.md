Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.
   - `partial_sum` has been decreased by `input_list[j][1]`.
   - `j` has been increased by 1.

2. **Condition for the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is greater than or equal to `d`.

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine which states need to be modified so that the loop can execute one more time.

4. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must still be greater than or equal to `d`.
   - Since `j` has already been incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, we need to check if the new value of `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` satisfies the condition.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the updated value of `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` (where `j` has been incremented) is still greater than or equal to `d`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must remain greater than or equal to `d`.

**Answer:**
State: **`input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`**
