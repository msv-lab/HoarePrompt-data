The given code initializes an empty list called `input_list`. This means that the previously defined variables `n`, `d`, and `read_input` remain unchanged. The only new variable created is `input_list`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0], `d` is read_input[1], `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is an empty list**
