`partial_sum` is decreased by the value of `input_list[j][1]`. Since `j` is initially 1, we are subtracting the second element of `input_list[1]` from `partial_sum`. The value of `partial_sum` was originally `max_factor - input_list[0][1]`.

After executing `partial_sum -= input_list[j][1]`, the new value of `partial_sum` will be `max_factor - input_list[0][1] - input_list[1][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to `input_list` during the loop iterations, `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, `i` is `n`, `max_factor` is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`, `partial_sum` is `max_factor - input_list[0][1] - input_list[1][1]`, `j` is 1, and `input_list[n][0] - input_list[1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`**
