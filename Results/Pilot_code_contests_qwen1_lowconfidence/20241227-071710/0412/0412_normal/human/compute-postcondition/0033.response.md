`partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`. The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d` is still valid, but the specific values of the variables `i`, `j`, `input_list`, and `d` are not affected by the operation. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `partial_sum`.

Output State: **`input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`, `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`.**
