The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is `read_input[0]` and must be greater than 0, `d` is `read_input[1]`, `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to `input_list` during the loop iterations, `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, `i` is `n`, `max_factor` is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`, `partial_sum` is `max_factor - input_list[0][1] - input_list[1][1] - input_list[2][1]`, `j` is 4, and `input_list[n][0] - input_list[3][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.**
