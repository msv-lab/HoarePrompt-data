According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that:

- `partial_sum` has been decreased by `input_list[j][1]`.
- `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.
- `j` has been incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `j` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value (meaning `j` is now `j + 1`).
2. The new condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0] >= d` must be true.

No other states need to be adjusted directly since the only relevant state change for the next iteration is the increment of `j` and the condition check for the loop.

State: **`partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`, `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`, `j` must be incremented by 1 and `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j + 1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`**
