To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration:
     - `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is less than `d`
     - `j` is the last index where `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` was greater than or equal to `d`
     - `partial_sum` is increased by `input_list[i][1]`
     - `max_factor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.

3. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each `i` in the range starting from 1 up to `n-1`, the loop body will be executed.
   - We need to consider what changes occur within the loop body and how they affect the state.

4. **Key Changes per Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] < d` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `partial_sum` is updated by adding `input_list[i][1]`.
   - `max_factor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - To enter the next iteration, `i` should be set to `i + 1`.
   - `j` should be the last index where `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` was greater than or equal to `d`.
   - `partial_sum` should be updated to reflect the new value (if any).
   - `max_factor` should be updated to reflect the new value of `partial_sum`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop.

**State Adjustment for Next Iteration:**
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `i + 1`.
- `j` remains the same since it is determined based on the previous values of `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` being greater than or equal to `d`.
- `partial_sum` will be updated based on the new `input_list[i][1]` if the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] < d` is true.
- `max_factor` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new `partial_sum`.

Since the exact value of `i` and `partial_sum` are not provided, we use the general form:

State: **`input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is less than `d`, `j` is the last index where `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` was greater than or equal to `d`, `partial_sum` is increased by `input_list[i+1][1]` (if the condition holds), `max_factor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`**

Thus, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is less than `d`, `j` is the last index where `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` was greater than or equal to `d`, `partial_sum` is increased by `input_list[i+1][1]` (if the condition holds), `max_factor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`**
