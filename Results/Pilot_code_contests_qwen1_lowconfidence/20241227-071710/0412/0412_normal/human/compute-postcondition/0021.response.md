The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The initial value of `j` is 0, so after executing this line of code, `j` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], read_input is a list containing n + d integers, the first n integers correspond to mi values and the last d integers correspond to si values, input_list is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to input_list during the loop iterations, input_list is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, i is n, max_factor is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in input_list, partial_sum is max_factor - input_list[0][1], j is 1, and input_list[n][0] - input_list[0][0] must be greater than or equal to d**
