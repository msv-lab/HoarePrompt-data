Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is `read_input[0]` and must be greater than 0.
   - `d` is `read_input[1]`.
   - `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers.
     - The first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values.
     - The last `d` integers correspond to `si` values.
   - `input_list` is equal to `user_input` plus a tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`.
   - `input_list` is a list of integers.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be less than `n-1` (since `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-1`).
   - Therefore, `i` is `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n`.
   - This means the loop will check if `i` (which is now `n`) is still within the range of `range(n)`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `d` remains the same.
   - `read_input` remains the same.
   - `input_list` remains the same.

Based on this reasoning, the updated states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is equal to `user_input` plus a tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`, `input_list` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`**.
