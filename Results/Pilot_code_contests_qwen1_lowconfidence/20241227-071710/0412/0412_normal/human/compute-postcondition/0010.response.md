According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n` and the loop needs `i` to be less than `n` to execute again.

Given:
- `n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0.
- `d` is read_input[1].
- `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers.
- The first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values.
- The last `d` integers correspond to `si` values.
- `input_list` is equal to `user_input` plus a tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`.
- `input_list` is a list of integers.
- `i` is `n`.
- `user_input` is a list of integers from user input.
- `input_list` now contains the tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])` appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` is currently `n`, we need to adjust `i` to be `n - 1` and ensure that `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `n`.

State: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is equal to `user_input` plus a tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`, `input_list` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `user_input` is a list of integers from user input, and `input_list` now contains the tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])` appended to it.**
