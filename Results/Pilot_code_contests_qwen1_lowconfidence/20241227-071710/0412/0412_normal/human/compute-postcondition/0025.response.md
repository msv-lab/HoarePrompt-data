Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is `read_input[0]` and must be greater than 0.
   - `d` is `read_input[1]`.
   - `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers.
   - The first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values.
   - The last `d` integers correspond to `si` values.
   - `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where these tuples were appended during the loop iterations.
   - `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `max_factor` is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`.
   - `partial_sum` is `max_factor - input_list[0][1] - input_list[1][1]`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `input_list[n][0] - input_list[1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop condition is `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

3. **Current States**:
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - The condition `input_list[n][0] - input_list[1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.

4. **Analyzing the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.
   - Since `i` is `n` and `j` is 2, we need to check if `input_list[n][0] - input_list[2][0]` is greater than or equal to `d`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `input_list[n][0] - input_list[2][0]` is greater than or equal to `d`.
   - This means that `input_list[n][0]` must be at least `input_list[2][0] + d`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - No other states need to be adjusted since the loop condition only depends on the values of `input_list[n][0]` and `input_list[2][0]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is `read_input[0]` and must be greater than 0, `d` is `read_input[1]`, `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to `input_list` during the loop iterations, `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, `i` is `n`, `max_factor` is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`, `partial_sum` is `max_factor - input_list[0][1] - input_list[1][1]`, `j` is 2, and `input_list[n][0] - input_list[2][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`**.
