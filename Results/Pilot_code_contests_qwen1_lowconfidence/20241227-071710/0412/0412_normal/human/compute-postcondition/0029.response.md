The code snippet `partial_sum += input_list[i][1]` updates the value of `partial_sum` by adding the second element of the tuple `input_list[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is `read_input[0]` and must be greater than 0.
- `d` is `read_input[1]`.
- `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values.
- `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to `input_list` during the loop iterations, and `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples.
- `i` is `n`.
- `max_factor` is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`.
- `partial_sum` is `max_factor - sum(input_list[k][1] for k in range(n))`.
- `j` is `n`.
- `input_list[n][0] - input_list[n-1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.

After executing the code snippet, `partial_sum` is updated by adding `input_list[i][1]` (which is `input_list[n][1]`), since `i` is `n`.

Therefore, the new value of `partial_sum` is `max_factor - sum(input_list[k][1] for k in range(n)) + input_list[n][1]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` is `read_input[0]` and must be greater than 0, `d` is `read_input[1]`, `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to `input_list` during the loop iterations, `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, `i` is `n+1`, `max_factor` is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`, `partial_sum` is `max_factor - sum(input_list[k][1] for k in range(n)) + input_list[n][1]`, `j` is `n`, `input_list[n][0] - input_list[n-1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`**.
