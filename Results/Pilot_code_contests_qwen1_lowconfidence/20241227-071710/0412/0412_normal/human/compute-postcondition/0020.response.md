The code `partial_sum -= input_list[j][1]` subtracts the second element of the tuple `input_list[j]` from `partial_sum`. Given the initial state:

- `partial_sum` is equal to `max_factor`, which is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`.
- `j` is `0`.

Therefore, `partial_sum` is reduced by the second element of `input_list[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], read_input is a list containing n + d integers, the first n integers correspond to mi values and the last d integers correspond to si values, input_list is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to input_list during the loop iterations, input_list is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, i is n, max_factor is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in input_list, partial_sum is max_factor - input_list[0][1], j is 0, and input_list[n][0] - input_list[0][0] must be greater than or equal to d**
