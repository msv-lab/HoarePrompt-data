According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `partial_sum` has been decreased by `input_list[j][1]`.
- `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.
- `j` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must still hold true after the loop body is executed. Since `j` is increased by 1 in the loop, the new condition will be `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d`.

To ensure the loop can continue, we need to adjust the state so that this new condition is met. The key adjustment here is to ensure that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d` holds true. Given that `j` is increased by 1, the previous value of `j` (which is now `j + 1`) should satisfy the condition with the current value of `input_list[i][0]`.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed to `partial_sum` as it is already correctly updated. We just need to ensure that `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d` is true.

State: **`partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`, `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`, `j` is increased by 1**
