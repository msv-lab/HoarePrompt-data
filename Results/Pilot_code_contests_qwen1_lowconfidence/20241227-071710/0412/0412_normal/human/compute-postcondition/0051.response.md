To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the condition of the `while` loop.

### Given Information:
- `partial_sum` has been decreased by `input_list[j][1]`.
- `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 (`j = j + 1`).

### Loop Condition:
The `while` loop runs as long as `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`.
   - `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.
   - `j` is updated to `j + 1`.

2. **Next Iteration Requirement:**
   - For the loop to continue, the new value of `j` (which is `j + 1`) must satisfy the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- The current value of `j` is increased by 1 in the previous iteration.
- Therefore, for the loop to continue, we need to check if the new value of `j` (i.e., `j + 1`) satisfies the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

### Adjusted States:
- We need to ensure that the updated value of `j` still meets the condition. Since `j` is now `j + 1`, we need to check if `input_list[i][0] - input_list[(j + 1) - 1][0] >= d` simplifies to `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`.

### Final State:
- `partial_sum` should remain the same since it is not directly involved in the loop condition.
- The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0] >= d` must be true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration needs to be modified to ensure the loop condition holds for the next iteration.

### Answer:
State: **`partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`, `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j+1][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d` and `j` is updated to `j + 1`**.

This ensures that the loop condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` is satisfied for the next iteration.
