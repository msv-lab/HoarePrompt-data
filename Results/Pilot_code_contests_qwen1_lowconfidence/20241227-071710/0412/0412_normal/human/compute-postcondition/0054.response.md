Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] < d \)
- \( j \) is the last index where \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] \geq d \)
- \( \text{partial\_sum} \) is increased by \( \text{input\_list}[i+1][1] \) (if the condition holds)
- \( \text{max\_factor} \) is updated to be the maximum of its current value and \( \text{partial\_sum} \)

### Code of the Loop
```python
while input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d:
    partial_sum -= input_list[j][1]
    j += 1
```

### Analysis of Loop Execution

1. **First Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is checked: \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] \geq d \)
   - If the condition holds, \( \text{partial\_sum} \) is decreased by \( \text{input\_list}[j][1] \)
   - \( j \) is incremented by 1

2. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - Each iteration of the loop continues as long as the condition \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] \geq d \) holds.
   - \( \text{partial\_sum} \) keeps decreasing by \( \text{input\_list}[j][1] \)
   - \( j \) keeps incrementing by 1

### Final State After the Loop

After the loop has executed all necessary iterations, the following conditions must hold:

- The loop terminates when the condition \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] \geq d \) no longer holds.
- This implies that \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] < d \).
- Since \( j \) is incremented each time the condition holds, \( j \) will eventually become such that the condition fails.

Thus, the final state of the variables will be:

- \( \text{partial\_sum} \) will be reduced by the sum of all elements \( \text{input\_list}[j][1] \) where \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] \geq d \)
- \( j \) will be the next index such that \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] < d \)

### Output State

Output State: **\( \text{partial\_sum} \) is reduced by the sum of all elements \( \text{input\_list}[j][1] \) where \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] \geq d \), \( j \) is the next index such that \( \text{input\_list}[i][0] - \text{input\_list}[j][0] < d \)**
