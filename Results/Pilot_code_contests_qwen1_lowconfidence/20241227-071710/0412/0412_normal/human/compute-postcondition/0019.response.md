To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the condition inside the loop: `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d`. 

Given the current state:
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `0`.
- `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples.
- `d` is `read_input[1]`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must be true when the loop starts. Since `i` is currently `n`, we need to ensure that `input_list[n][0] - input_list[0][0] >= d` holds true. However, since `i` is already set to `n` and `j` is `0`, the only way to satisfy the condition is to ensure that the difference between the first elements of `input_list[n]` and `input_list[0]` is indeed greater than or equal to `d`.

Since `i` is already set to `n`, no further adjustment to `i` is necessary. We need to ensure that the initial conditions meet the loop's requirement.

**State**: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], read_input is a list containing n + d integers, the first n integers correspond to mi values and the last d integers correspond to si values, input_list is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to input_list during the loop iterations, input_list is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, i is n, max_factor is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in input_list, partial_sum is max_factor, j is 0, and input_list[n][0] - input_list[0][0] must be greater than or equal to d**
