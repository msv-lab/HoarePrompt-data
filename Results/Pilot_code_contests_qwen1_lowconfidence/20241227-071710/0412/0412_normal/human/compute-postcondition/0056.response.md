The code `max_factor = max(max_factor, partial_sum)` updates the value of `max_factor` to be the maximum between its current value and `partial_sum`. The `partial_sum` itself is not updated by this line of code; it only checks which of the two values (`max_factor` or `partial_sum`) is larger and assigns that value to `max_factor`.

Since no other operations are performed on `partial_sum`, its value remains unchanged. The `max_factor` variable is updated to reflect the maximum value between its current value and `partial_sum`.

Output State: **`partial_sum` is reduced by the sum of all elements `input_list[j][1]` where `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` and then increased by `input_list[i][1]`, and the condition for finding the next index \( j \) where \( \text{input_list}[i][0] - \text{input_list}[j][0] < d \) is still valid; `max_factor` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `partial_sum`.**
