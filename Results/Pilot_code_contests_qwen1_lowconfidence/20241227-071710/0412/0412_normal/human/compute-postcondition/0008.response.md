The code snippet reads input from the user and splits it into integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means `user_input` is now a list of integers.

- `user_input` was initially derived from `read_input` which itself consists of the first `n` integers (`mi` values) followed by the last `d` integers (`si` values).
- After the code executes, `user_input` is updated, but `read_input`, `n`, `d`, `mi`, `si`, `i`, and `input_list` remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the changes and maintain the preconditions:

1. `user_input` is updated to be a list of integers from user input.
2. The preconditions about `read_input`, `n`, `d`, `mi`, `si`, `i`, and `input_list` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is equal to `user_input` plus a tuple `(user_input[0], user_input[1])`, `input_list` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `user_input` is a list of integers from user input.**
