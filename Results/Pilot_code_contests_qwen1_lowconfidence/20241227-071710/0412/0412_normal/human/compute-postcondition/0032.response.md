Let's analyze the given `while` loop step by step:

The loop condition is:
```python
while input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables and Conditions:**
   - `input_list`: A list of lists where each inner list contains at least two elements (we assume based on the indexing).
   - `i`: An index into `input_list`.
   - `j`: Another index into `input_list`.
   - `d`: A numeric value.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as the difference between the first elements of the sublists indexed by `i` and `j` in `input_list` is greater than or equal to `d`.

3. **Current State Before Loop:**
   - We don't know the exact values of `input_list[i][0]`, `input_list[j][0]`, and `d`, but we know the loop is about to start.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d` must be true.

5. **Ensure the Condition is Met:**
   - To make sure the loop executes at least once, we need to ensure that the initial values of `input_list[i][0]` and `input_list[j][0]` satisfy the condition when the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute at least once, the difference between `input_list[i][0]` and `input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`.

Thus, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect this condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`**
