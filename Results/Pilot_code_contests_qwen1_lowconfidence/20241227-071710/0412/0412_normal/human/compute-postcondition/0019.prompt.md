You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state right before the loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one time, please simply repeat the program state right before the loop. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer. `n` beinng an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State right before the while loop: `total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, students is 2 less than its initial value, So for the loop to  executed the first time time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State right before the while loop: Let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is `read_input[0]` and must be greater than 0.
   - `d` is `read_input[1]`.
   - `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers.
   - The first `n` integers in `read_input` correspond to `mi` values.
   - The last `d` integers in `read_input` correspond to `si` values.
   - `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers.
   - `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `max_factor` is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`.
   - `partial_sum` is `max_factor`.
   - `j` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `n`, we need to adjust `i` to be 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect `i` being set to 1 while keeping all other conditions intact.

**State**: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], read_input is a list containing n + d integers, the first n integers correspond to mi values and the last d integers correspond to si values, input_list is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to input_list during the loop iterations, input_list is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, i is 1, max_factor is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in input_list, partial_sum is max_factor, j is 0**
```
while input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] >= d:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
