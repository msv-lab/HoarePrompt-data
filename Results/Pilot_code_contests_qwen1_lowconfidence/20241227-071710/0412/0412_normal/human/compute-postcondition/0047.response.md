`j` is incremented by 1. The condition `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d` is not checked in this line of code, only the value of `j` is updated. The state of `partial_sum` and the values of `input_list[i][0]` and `input_list[j][0]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`partial_sum` is decreased by `input_list[j][1]`, `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` must be greater than or equal to `d`, `j` is increased by 1**
