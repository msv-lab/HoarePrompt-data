`j` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `j` is now 0, and no other variables are affected. The precondition remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is read_input[0] and must be greater than 0, `d` is read_input[1], `read_input` is a list containing `n + d` integers, the first `n` integers correspond to `mi` values and the last `d` integers correspond to `si` values, `input_list` is a list of tuples, each tuple consisting of two integers, where the tuples were appended to `input_list` during the loop iterations, `input_list` is sorted based on the first elements of the tuples, `i` is `n`, `max_factor` is the second element of the tuple with the smallest first element in `input_list`, `partial_sum` is `max_factor`, `j` is 0**
