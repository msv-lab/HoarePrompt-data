`max_factor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_factor` and `partial_sum`. Since `partial_sum` is increased by `input_list[i][1]`, `partial_sum` now holds a new value. However, the original values of `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0] < d` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` is less than `d`, `j` is the last index where `input_list[i][0] - input_list[j][0]` was greater than or equal to `d`, `partial_sum` is increased by `input_list[i][1]`, and `max_factor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `partial_sum`.
