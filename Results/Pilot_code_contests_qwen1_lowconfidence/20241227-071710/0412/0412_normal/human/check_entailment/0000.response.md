Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple friends can be included in the company without violating the condition that no friend feels poor. Specifically, the program only considers the first friend and does not check if other friends can be included in the company without making any friend feel poor.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 50
0 100
50 50
100 50
```
According to the problem description, Kefa can invite friends such that no friend feels poor. In this case, both the second and third friends can be invited because neither has 50 or more units of money more than the other. The total friendship factor would be `50 + 50 = 100`.

However, the program only considers the first friend and sets `max_factor` to `100`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `100`, but the program fails to achieve this because it does not properly handle the inclusion of multiple friends under the given constraints.
