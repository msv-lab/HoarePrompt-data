Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of friends `n` and the minimum difference `d` (`n` and `d` are read from the input and stored in variables `n` and `d`).
   - It then reads the details of each friend (`mi` and `si`) and stores them in a list of tuples `input_list`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of friends based on their `mi` values. Sorting ensures that the friends are considered in ascending order of their money amounts.

3. **Calculating Maximum Friendship Factor**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of friendship factors (`si`) such that no two friends in the selected group have a difference in `mi` values greater than or equal to `d`.
   - It maintains a running sum of friendship factors (`partial_sum`) and updates the maximum sum encountered (`max_factor`).

4. **Adjustments and Updates**:
   - During the iteration, if the difference between the current friend's `mi` value and the `mi` value of the friend at the start of the current window (`input_list[j][0]`) is greater than or equal to `d`, the program adjusts the running sum by subtracting the `si` value of the friend at the start of the window.
   - This ensures that the selected group of friends adheres to the condition that no friend feels poor.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum of friendship factors found, which is the required output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly follows the problem description by:
- Reading and processing the input data.
- Sorting the friends based on their `mi` values.
- Using a sliding window approach to maximize the total friendship factor while ensuring no two friends have a difference in `mi` values greater than or equal to `d`.
- Outputting the maximum total friendship factor.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
