Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to consider the possibility of multiple friends having the same amount of money and the threshold `d` being larger than the difference in money between consecutive friends. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 10
10 5
20 5
30 5
40 5
```

According to the problem description, the optimal solution should include all friends since no one feels poor compared to another (the difference in money is less than 10). However, the provided code may not handle this case correctly because it only considers the first occurrence of friends with the same amount of money and does not ensure that the total friendship factor is maximized by including all such friends.

To fix this issue, the code needs to adjust the logic to handle cases where friends have the same amount of money and ensure that the total friendship factor is maximized by including all such friends.
