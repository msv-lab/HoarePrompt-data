Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads the number of friends \( n \) and the minimum difference \( d \) in the first line.
   - It then reads the details of each friend, storing both the amount of money (\( mi \)) and the friendship factor (\( si \)) in a list of tuples.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of tuples based on the amount of money (\( mi \)). Sorting ensures that we can iterate through the friends in increasing order of their wealth.

3. **Finding the Maximum Friendship Factor**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum total friendship factor under the constraint that no two friends in the selected group should differ in wealth by more than \( d \).
   - It maintains two variables: `max_factor` to store the maximum total friendship factor found so far, and `partial_sum` to accumulate the total friendship factor of the current group of friends.

4. **Iterating Through Friends**:
   - For each friend, it checks if the difference in wealth between the current friend and the earliest friend in the group (tracked by `j`) is less than or equal to \( d \).
   - If the condition holds, it adds the current friend’s friendship factor to `partial_sum`.
   - If the condition fails, it removes the earliest friend’s friendship factor from `partial_sum` and moves the pointer `j` forward.
   - During each iteration, it updates `max_factor` to be the maximum of `max_factor` and `partial_sum`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all friends, the program prints the maximum total friendship factor.

Given this explanation, the program correctly follows the problem description. It considers all possible groups of friends, ensuring no two friends in the group have more than \( d \) units of difference in their wealth, and maximizes the total friendship factor. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
