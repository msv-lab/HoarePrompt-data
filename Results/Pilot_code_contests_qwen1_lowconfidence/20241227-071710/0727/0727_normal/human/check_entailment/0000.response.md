Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Specifically, the logic for finding the correct order of the sequence does not always work as intended. Let's consider a specific example:

For the input:
```
6
4 8 6 3 12 9
```

The expected output is:
```
9 3 6 12 4 8
```

However, the program does not guarantee the correct order. For instance, in the given example, the program might get stuck in an infinite loop or produce an incorrect sequence because it relies on removing elements from a set without properly handling the order of operations. The logic for checking and appending the next valid number (either half or triple) is flawed and does not ensure that the sequence can be constructed correctly for all inputs.

To fix this, a more robust approach would involve sorting the array and then using a priority queue or a similar data structure to efficiently find the next valid number in the sequence. The current implementation may fail to handle certain sequences correctly due to the way it removes and checks elements from the set.
