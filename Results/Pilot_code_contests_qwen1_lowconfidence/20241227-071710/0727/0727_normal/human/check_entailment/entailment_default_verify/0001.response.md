Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and fails to ensure that the sequence can be rearranged to match the required operations in any order. As demonstrated by the counterexample, the sequence `9 3 6 12 4 8` is not valid for the given input `[4, 8, 6, 3, 12, 9]`. The program logic does not guarantee that all necessary intermediate values (like `18` in this case) will be present in the sequence, leading to invalid rearrangements. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description requirements.
