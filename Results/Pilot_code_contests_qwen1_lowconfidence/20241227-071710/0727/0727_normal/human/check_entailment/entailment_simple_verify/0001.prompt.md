You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp likes to play with numbers. He takes some integer number x, writes it down on the board, and then performs with it n - 1 operations of the two kinds: 

  * divide the number x by 3 (x must be divisible by 3); 
  * multiply the number x by 2. 



After each operation, Polycarp writes down the result on the board and replaces x by the result. So there will be n numbers on the board after all.

You are given a sequence of length n — the numbers that Polycarp wrote down. This sequence is given in arbitrary order, i.e. the order of the sequence can mismatch the order of the numbers written on the board.

Your problem is to rearrange (reorder) elements of this sequence in such a way that it can match possible Polycarp's game in the order of the numbers written on the board. I.e. each next number will be exactly two times of the previous number or exactly one third of previous number.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Input

The first line of the input contatins an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the elements in the sequence. The second line of the input contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}) — rearranged (reordered) sequence that Polycarp can wrote down on the board.

Output

Print n integer numbers — rearranged (reordered) input sequence that can be the sequence that Polycarp could write down on the board.

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Examples

Input

6
4 8 6 3 12 9


Output

9 3 6 12 4 8 


Input

4
42 28 84 126


Output

126 42 84 28 


Input

2
1000000000000000000 3000000000000000000


Output

3000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 

Note

In the first example the given sequence can be rearranged in the following way: [9, 3, 6, 12, 4, 8]. It can match possible Polycarp's game which started with x = 9.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the sequence can be rearranged to match the required operations in any order. Let's consider a counterexample:

For the input:
```
6
4 8 6 3 12 9
```

The program output is:
```
9 3 6 12 4 8
```

However, this sequence cannot be derived from any starting number `x` through the allowed operations. Here’s why:

- Starting with `9`, the next number could be `3` or `27`. Since `3` is in the sequence, the next operation would be to multiply by 2 to get `6`.
- From `6`, the next number could be `2` or `18`. Since `2` is not in the sequence, we consider `18`. But `18` is not present in the sequence.
- From `18`, the next number could be `6` or `54`. Since `6` is already in the sequence, the next operation would be to multiply by 2 to get `12`.
- From `12`, the next number could be `4` or `36`. Since `4` is in the sequence, the next operation would be to multiply by 2 to get `8`.

So the sequence `9 3 6 12 4 8` is not valid because `18` is required between `6` and `12`, but `18` is not present in the sequence.

Thus, the program fails to correctly rearrange the sequence for all potential cases, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
