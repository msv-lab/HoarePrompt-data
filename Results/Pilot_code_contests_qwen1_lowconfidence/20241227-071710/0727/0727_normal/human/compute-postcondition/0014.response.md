The code assigns a new lambda function to `read_ints`, which maps the input strings to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This does not affect the existing `read_strs` function or the `read_int` function, and the program terminates immediately after this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **the program terminates immediately, `read_strs` is the function `lambda : raw_input().split()`, `read_int` is a lambda function that converts input to an integer, `read_ints` is a lambda function that maps input strings to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())**
