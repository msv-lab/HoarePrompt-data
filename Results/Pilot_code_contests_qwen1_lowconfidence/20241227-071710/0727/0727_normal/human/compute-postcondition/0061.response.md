`arr` removes the element which is twice the value of `a`. Since `a` is the original value of `a`, the element removed from `arr` is `a * 2`. All other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain the element `a * 2`, `a` is the original value of `a`, and `res` contains the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position.**
