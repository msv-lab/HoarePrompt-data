The code `a = res[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `res` to the variable `a`. The last element of `res` is the original value of `a`, which was added to `res` in the previous steps. Therefore, `a` now holds the value of the original `a`.

The states of the other variables and the conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` contains at least one unique integer, `a` is the original value of `a`, and `res` contains the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position. `a` is now the original value of `a`.**
