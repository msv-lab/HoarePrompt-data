The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the execution of the code does not change any variable values or add any new information to the state. The `continue` statement in this context acts as a no-operation (NOP) in terms of changing the state of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain `a / 2` if it existed, `a` is the original value of `a`, `res` contains the original elements plus `a / 2` in the first position and the original value of `a` in the last position.**
