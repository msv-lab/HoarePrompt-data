The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain `a * 2`, `a` is the last element of `res`, `res` now contains all original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position and also includes `a * 2`.**
