The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, there is no loop present in the given code snippet. Therefore, the execution of the code does not change the values of any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain the element `a * 2`, `a` is the original value of `a`, and `res` now contains its original elements plus `a * 2` in the last position.**
