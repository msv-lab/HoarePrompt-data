The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables `n`, `arr`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not modify the values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input; `arr` is either the same as the original list minus one instance of `a / 3` if `a / 3` is in `arr`, or the same as the original list otherwise; `a` is the last element of `res`; `res` is the original state of `res` plus the value `a / 3` at the end.**
