The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of `n` integer numbers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each number is within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}`. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence.

Case_1: The function returns `True` if the list can be rearranged as described above.
Case_2: Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers and return `True` if the list can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number, otherwise it returns `False`.
