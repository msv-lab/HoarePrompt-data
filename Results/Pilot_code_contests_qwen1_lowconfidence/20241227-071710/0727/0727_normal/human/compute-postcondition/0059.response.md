`res` is appended with the value `a / 3`. Since `a` is the original value of `a`, the new value added to `res` is `a / 3`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is modified to remove `original_a / 3` if it exists, `a` is the original value of `a`, and `res` now contains the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position followed by `a / 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is modified to remove `original_a / 3` if it exists, `a` is the original value of `a`, and `res` now contains the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position followed by `a / 3`.**
