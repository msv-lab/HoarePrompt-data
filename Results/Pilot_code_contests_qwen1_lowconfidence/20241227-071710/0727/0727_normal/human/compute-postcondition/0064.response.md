Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` contains at least one unique integer, `a` is the original value of `a`, and `res` contains the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position. If `a * 2` is in `arr`, then `res` will have `a * 2` appended to it. If `a * 2` is not in `arr`, then `res` remains unchanged.***
