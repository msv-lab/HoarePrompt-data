Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is an empty set, `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the last element of `arr` repeated until no further valid operations can be performed according to the rules inside the loop.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `arr` contains up to `n-1` unique integers, and `res` contains one integer (the last element of the original `arr`).
- During each iteration of the loop, the value of `a` is updated based on the conditions provided:
  - If `a` is even and `a / 2` is in `arr`, `a` is replaced by `a / 2` and `a / 2` is removed from `arr`.
  - If `a * 3` is in `arr`, `a` is replaced by `a * 3` and `a * 3` is removed from `arr`.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, `a` remains unchanged.
- The process continues until `arr` is empty, meaning no further valid operations can be performed.
- In the final state, `arr` will be empty because the loop removes elements from `arr` during each iteration. `res` will contain the original elements of `arr` plus the last element of `arr` repeated until no further valid operations can be performed according to the rules inside the loop.
