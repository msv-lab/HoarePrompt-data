Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer (with `a * 2` either added or removed), `a` is `a * 2` if `a * 2` is in `arr`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, and `res` contains the original elements plus the new element `a * 2` if it meets the condition.***
