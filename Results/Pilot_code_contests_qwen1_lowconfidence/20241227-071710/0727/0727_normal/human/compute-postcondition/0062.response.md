`res` is updated by adding `[a * 2]` to its current list of elements. Since `a` is the original value of `a`, the new value added to `res` is `a * 2`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, and the original value of `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain the element `a * 2`, `a` is the original value of `a`, and `res` now contains its original elements plus `a * 2` in the last position.**
