The code `res = res + [a / 3]` appends the value `a / 3` to the list `res`. 

Let's break down the initial state:
- `n` is an integer value obtained from user input.
- `arr` is either the same as the original list minus one instance of `a / 3` if `a / 3` is in `arr`, or the same as the original list otherwise.
- `a` is the last element of `res`.
- `res` is either `[2, 4, 6, 4]` if `a` is even and `a / 2` is in `arr`, `[a * 3]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position if `a * 3` is found in `arr`, or remains unchanged as the original state where it contains `[a]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position if `a * 3` is not found in `arr`.

After appending `a / 3` to `res`, the new state of `res` will include `a / 3` at the end.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input; `arr` is either the same as the original list minus one instance of `a / 3` if `a / 3` is in `arr`, or the same as the original list otherwise; `a` is the last element of `res`; `res` is the original state of `res` plus the value `a / 3` at the end.**
