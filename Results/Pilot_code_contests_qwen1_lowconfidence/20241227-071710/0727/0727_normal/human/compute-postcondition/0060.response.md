The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state of the program. The values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is modified to remove `original_a / 3` if it exists, `a` is the original value of `a`, and `res` now contains the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position followed by `a / 3`.**
