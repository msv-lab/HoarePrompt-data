The code defines a new lambda function `read_int` which takes input from the user and converts it to an integer. However, this does not execute any input or perform any operations with the existing variables. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **the program terminates immediately, `read_strs` is the function `lambda : raw_input().split(), read_int` is a lambda function that converts input to an integer**
