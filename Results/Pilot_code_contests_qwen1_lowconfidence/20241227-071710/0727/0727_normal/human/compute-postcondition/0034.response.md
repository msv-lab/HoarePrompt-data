Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer, `res` is a list. If `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `arr` is updated to exclude `a / 2` and `res` is updated to contain `a / 2` as its first element, keeping the rest of its elements unchanged. Otherwise, `res` is updated to contain `a * 3` as its first element and `a` as its second element.***
