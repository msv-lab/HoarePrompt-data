The given code snippet introduces a lambda function `epr` which writes space-separated arguments to `sys.stderr`. However, no variables are assigned or modified within this code snippet. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence. INF is float('+inf'). The Python implementation is PyPy (indicated by sys.subversion[0] == 'PyPy'); sys.stdout is set to io.BytesIO() for handling output in memory. The `epr` lambda function is defined to write space-separated arguments to `sys.stderr`.**
