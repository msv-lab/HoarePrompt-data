Postcondition: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` contains at least one unique integer, `a` is the last element of `res`, and `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position. If `a * 2` is in `arr`, `res` becomes `[a * 2]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged as the original state where it contains `[a]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position.**
