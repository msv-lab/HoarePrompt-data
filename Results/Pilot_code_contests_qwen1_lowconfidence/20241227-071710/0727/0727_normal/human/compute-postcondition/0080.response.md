The code `arr.remove(a * 2)` removes the element `a * 2` from the list `arr` if it exists. This operation changes the content of `arr` but does not affect other variables. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer value obtained from user input.
- `arr` contains at least one unique integer.
- `a` is the last element of `res`.
- `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position.

If `a` is even and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 4]`. Otherwise, `res` is either `[a * 3]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position if `a * 3` is found in `arr`, or it remains unchanged as the original state where it contains `[a]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position if `a * 3` is not found in `arr`.

Since the code only affects `arr`, we need to ensure that the updated state of `arr` is reflected. However, without knowing the specific value of `a * 2`, we cannot determine exactly which element was removed unless we assume `a * 2` is present in `arr`. 

Therefore, the output state, assuming `a * 2` is in `arr`, is:
- `arr` now does not contain `a * 2`.
- All other variables remain in their initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain `a * 2`, `a` is the last element of `res`, `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position.**
