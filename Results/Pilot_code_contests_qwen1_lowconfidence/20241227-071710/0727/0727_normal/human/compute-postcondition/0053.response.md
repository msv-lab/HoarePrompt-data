`res` is updated by appending `a * 3` to the beginning of the list. The value of `a` is multiplied by 3, and this new value is added to the start of `res`. The initial value of `res` contained the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position. After the operation, the original value of `a` is no longer in the last position but the value `a * 3` is added to the start of the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain `a * 3` (if `a * 3` was originally in `arr`), `a` is the original value of `a`, `res` contains the original elements with `a * 3` added to the beginning**
