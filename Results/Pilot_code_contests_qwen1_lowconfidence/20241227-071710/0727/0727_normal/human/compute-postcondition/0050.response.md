The code `res = [a / 2] + res` impacts the variable `res` by appending the value of `a / 2` to the beginning of the list `res`. The initial state of `res` contains the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position.

Given this, the new state of `res` will be the original elements, followed by `a / 2`, and finally the original value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain `a / 2` if it existed, `a` is the original value of `a`, `res` contains the original elements plus `a / 2` in the first position and the original value of `a` in the last position.**
