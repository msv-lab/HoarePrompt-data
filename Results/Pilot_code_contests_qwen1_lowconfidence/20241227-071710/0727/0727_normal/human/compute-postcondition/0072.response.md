The code `res = [a * 3] + res` creates a new list by adding the value of `a * 3` (which is `3 * a` since `a` is the first element of `res`) to the beginning of the existing list `res`. This operation does not affect the value of `n`, `arr`, or `a`. 

Since `res` originally contained the original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position, and now it starts with `a * 3` followed by the rest of `res`, the updated state of `res` is the concatenation of `[a * 3]` and the original `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` contains at least one unique integer, `a` is the first element of `res`, and `res` now contains `[a * 3]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position.**
