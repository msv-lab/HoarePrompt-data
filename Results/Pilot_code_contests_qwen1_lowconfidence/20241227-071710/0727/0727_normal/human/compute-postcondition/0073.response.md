The code `continue` is used within a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided context, the code does not change any variable values. The states of the variables remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` contains at least one unique integer, `a` is the first element of `res`, and `res` now contains `[a * 3]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position.**
