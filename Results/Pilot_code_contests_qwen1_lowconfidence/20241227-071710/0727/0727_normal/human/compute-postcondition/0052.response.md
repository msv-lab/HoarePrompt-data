`arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer, and the value of `a` is known. The code removes `a * 3` from `arr`. Since sets only contain unique elements, if `a * 3` was originally in `arr`, it will be removed. If it wasn't, `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain `a * 3` (if `a * 3` was originally in `arr`), `a` is the original value of `a`, `res` contains the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position**
