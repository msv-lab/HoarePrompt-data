The code `arr = set(arr)` converts the list `arr` into a set, removing any duplicate elements in the process. The initial state tells us that `n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, and `res` is a list containing one integer (the last element of the original `arr`). After converting `arr` to a set, the length of `arr` changes to match the number of unique elements in the original list. Since the original `arr` had `n-1` elements, and assuming there were no duplicates, the set `arr` will now contain these unique elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing up to `n-1` unique integers, `res` is a list containing one integer (the last element of the original `arr`)**
