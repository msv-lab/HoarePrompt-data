The code `arr = read_ints()` assigns the result of `read_ints()` to `arr`. `read_ints()` is a lambda function that maps input strings to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since `n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `read_ints()` will take `n` space-separated integers as input and convert them to a list of integers.

The output state after executing the code will be:
- `n` is an integer value obtained from user input
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers, each obtained from user input and converted to an integer

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers**
