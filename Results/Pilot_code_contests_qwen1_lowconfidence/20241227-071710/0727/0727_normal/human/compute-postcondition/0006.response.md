The code snippet provided does not actually execute any operations or modify any variables. It merely reassigns the `raw_input` function to read from `sys.stdin`. Since no changes are made to any variables or the state, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence. INF is float('+inf'). The Python implementation is PyPy (indicated by sys.subversion[0] == 'PyPy'); sys.stdout is set to io.BytesIO() for handling output in memory. `raw_input` is now a lambda function that reads from `sys.stdin`.**
