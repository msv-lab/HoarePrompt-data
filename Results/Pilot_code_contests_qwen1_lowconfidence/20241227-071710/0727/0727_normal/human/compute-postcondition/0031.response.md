The code `res = [a * 3] + res` appends `a * 3` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `a` is the last element of the original `arr`, and `res` contains only one integer which is `a`.

Let's denote the last element of the original `arr` as `a`. Since `res` originally contained `[a]`, after the operation, `res` will become `[a * 3, a]`.

The rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged:
- `n` is an integer value obtained from user input.
- `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer.
- `res` is now `[a * 3, a]`.
- `a` is equal to the integer in `res`, specifically the second element of `res` which is `a`.

So, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer, `res` is `[a * 3, a]`, `a` is equal to the integer in `res` (specifically the second element of `res`).**
