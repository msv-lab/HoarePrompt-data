The code defines a lambda function `pr` which writes a space-separated string of arguments to `sys.stdout`. This does not change the values of any variables, but it does set up a way to print output. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence. INF is float('+inf'). The Python implementation is PyPy (indicated by sys.subversion[0] == 'PyPy'); sys.stdout is set to io.BytesIO() for handling output in memory. The `pr` lambda function is defined to write space-separated arguments to `sys.stdout`.**
