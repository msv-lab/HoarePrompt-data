The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect and the program simply moves to the end without changing any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing all its original elements except for `a / 2`, `res` is a list containing the first element as `a / 2` and the rest as the original elements of `res`, `a` is equal to the integer in `res`**
