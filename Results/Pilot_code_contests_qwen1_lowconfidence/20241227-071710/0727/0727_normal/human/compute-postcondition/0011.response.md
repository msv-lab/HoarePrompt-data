The code `read_str = raw_input` assigns the function `raw_input` to the variable `read_str`. This does not affect the termination of the program or any other variables. The program still terminates immediately, and no new variables are introduced or modified.

Output State: **the program terminates immediately, `read_str` is the function `raw_input`**
