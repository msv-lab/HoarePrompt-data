The code appends `a * 2` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `a` is the last element of `res`, and `res` does not contain `a * 2`. After executing the code, `a * 2` will be added to `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain `a * 2`, `a` is the last element of `res`, `res` now contains all original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position and also includes `a * 2`.**
