The provided code uses `atexit.register` to register a function to be called at the end of the program's execution. Specifically, it registers a lambda function that writes the contents of `sys.stdout` back to `sys.__stdout__`. This means that any output generated during the execution of the program will be captured and written to the standard output at the end.

However, this code does not directly affect the state of any variables. It merely sets up the environment for managing output. The input state, which includes the list of integers, remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence. INF is float('+inf'). The Python implementation is PyPy (indicated by sys.subversion[0] == 'PyPy'); sys.stdout is set to io.BytesIO() for handling output in memory. At the end of the program, any output generated will be written to the standard output via the registered function.**
