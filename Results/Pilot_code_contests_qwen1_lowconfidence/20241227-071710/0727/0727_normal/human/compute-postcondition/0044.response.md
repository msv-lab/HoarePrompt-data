The `continue` statement in this context does not change the values of any variables or affect the preconditions. It simply moves the flow of execution to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the loop or conditional block that contains this `continue` statement would be skipped.

Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer (with `a * 2` still removed), `a` is `a * 2`, `res` contains the original elements plus the new element `a * 2`.**
