`a / 2` is removed from the set `arr`. Given that `a % 2 == 0` and `a / 2` is an element in `arr`, after removing `a / 2` from `arr`, the updated state of the variables is as follows: `n` remains as an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is now a set containing all its original elements except for `a / 2`, `res` is a list containing one integer which is the last element of the original `arr`, and `a` is still equal to the integer in `res`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing all its original elements except for `a / 2`, `res` is a list containing one integer which is the last element of the original `arr`, `a` is equal to the integer in `res`.**
