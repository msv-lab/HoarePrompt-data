The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input; `arr` is [4, 6]; `a` is 4; `res` is [2, 4, 6, 4]**
