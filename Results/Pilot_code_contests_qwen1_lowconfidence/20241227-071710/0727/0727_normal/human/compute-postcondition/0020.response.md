`res` is assigned the value of `arr.pop()`, which removes and returns the last element of the list `arr`. The state of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `arr` is updated to remove its last element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, `res` is a list containing one integer (the last element of the original `arr`).**
