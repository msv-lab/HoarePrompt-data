The given code initializes a constant `INF` with the value of positive infinity. This does not affect the input list of integers or any other variables related to the sequence of numbers. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the constant `INF`. However, since the problem does not specify any operations on the list of integers or involve the constant `INF` in any way, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence; INF is float('+inf')**
