Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer, `a` is the original value of `a`, `res` contains the original elements plus the original value of `a` in the last position. If `a * 3` is in `arr`, then `a * 3` is added to the beginning of `res`. Otherwise, the state of `arr` and `res` remains unchanged.***
