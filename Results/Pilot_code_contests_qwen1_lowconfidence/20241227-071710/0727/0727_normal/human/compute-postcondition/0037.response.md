`a` is the last element of `res` and its value is divisible by 3, so `a / 3` is an element in `arr`. The code removes `a / 3` from `arr`. After removing `a / 3`, the value of `a` remains unchanged, but `arr` now has one less element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer (one less than before), `a` is the last element of `res` and its value is divisible by 3**
