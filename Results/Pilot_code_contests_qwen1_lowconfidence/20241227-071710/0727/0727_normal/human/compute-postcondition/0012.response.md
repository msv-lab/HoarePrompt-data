The code defines a lambda function `read_strs` that takes no arguments and returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `raw_input()`. However, this does not assign the lambda function to any variable or execute it, so it does not change the values of existing variables. The program also terminates immediately afterward, meaning no further operations are performed.

Output State: **the program terminates immediately, `read_strs` is the function `lambda : raw_input().split()`**
