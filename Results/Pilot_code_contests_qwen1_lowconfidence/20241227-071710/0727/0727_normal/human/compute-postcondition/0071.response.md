`a` is the first element of `res`, and `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position. Therefore, `a` is also the first element of `arr`. The code `arr.remove(a * 3)` attempts to remove an element from `arr` that is equal to `a * 3`. However, since `a` is the first element of `arr` and the only constraint is that `arr` contains at least one unique integer, there is no guarantee that `a * 3` exists in `arr`. If `a * 3` does not exist in `arr`, the `remove` method will raise a `ValueError`.

Since the initial state does not specify whether `a * 3` is in `arr`, we assume it is not unless explicitly stated otherwise. Therefore, the `remove` operation fails, and the program will raise an error.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` contains at least one unique integer, `a` is the first element of `res`, and `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position. The program raises a `ValueError` due to the `remove` operation attempting to remove `a * 3` which does not exist in `arr`.**
