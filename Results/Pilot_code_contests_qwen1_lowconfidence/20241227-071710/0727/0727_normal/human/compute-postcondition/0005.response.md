The code snippet `sys.stdin = io.BytesIO(sys.stdin.read())` does the following:

1. It reads from the current `sys.stdin`.
2. It creates a `BytesIO` object with the contents of `sys.stdin`.
3. It assigns this `BytesIO` object to `sys.stdin`.

This effectively changes `sys.stdin` to read from an in-memory buffer containing the original input data. However, this does not affect the actual input data or any other variables. It only changes how `sys.stdin` is being read.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence. INF is float('+inf'). The Python implementation is PyPy (indicated by sys.subversion[0] == 'PyPy'); sys.stdout is set to io.BytesIO() for handling output in memory. `sys.stdin` is now a BytesIO object containing the original input data.**
