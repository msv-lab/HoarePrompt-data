Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value obtained from user input; `arr` contains at least one unique integer; `a` is the last element of `res`; if `a % 3 == 0` and `a / 3` is in `arr`, then `arr` is modified to exclude one instance of `a / 3` and `res` becomes the original state plus `a / 3` at the end; otherwise, if `a * 2` is in `arr`, `res` becomes `[a * 2]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position; if neither condition is met, `res` remains unchanged as the original state where it contains `[a]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position.***
