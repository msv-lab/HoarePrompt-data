Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` contains at least one unique integer, `a` is the first element of `res`, and `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position. If `a` is even and `a / 2` is in `arr`, then `res` becomes `[2, 4, 6, 4]`. Otherwise, `res` is either `[a * 3]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position if `a * 3` is found in `arr`, or it remains unchanged as the original state where it contains `[a]` followed by the original elements of `arr` and the original value of `a` in the last position if `a * 3` is not found in `arr`.***
