Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer. `a` is updated as follows: if `a` is divisible by 3 and `a / 3` is in `arr`, then `a` becomes `a / 3`; otherwise, `a` is doubled to `a * 2` if `a * 2` is in `arr`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. `res` contains the original elements plus the new value of `a` in the last position.***
