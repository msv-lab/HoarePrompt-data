The code `a = res[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `res` to the variable `a`. 

Given the precondition:
- `n` is an integer value obtained from user input.
- `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer.
- `res` is a list.

The impact of this line of code is that the last element of `res` is assigned to `a`. Since `res` might have been updated multiple times before this line, the exact value of `a` depends on the last update to `res`.

However, without knowing the exact content of `res`, we can only say that `a` now holds the last element of `res`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer, `a` is the last element of `res`**
