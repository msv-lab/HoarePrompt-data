The code `pr(*res)` calls a function `pr` with the elements of the list `res` unpacked as arguments. However, the function `pr` is not defined in the provided code snippet, and there is no loop or operation performed within the given code to modify `res`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer value obtained from user input.
- `arr` is an empty set.
- `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the last element of `arr` repeated until no further valid operations can be performed according to the rules inside the loop.

Since the code does not perform any operations that would modify `res` or the other variables, the values of these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is an empty set, `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the last element of `arr` repeated until no further valid operations can be performed according to the rules inside the loop.**
