The code appends the value of `a * 2` to the list `res`. According to the initial state, `a` is the last element of `res`, and it is not divisible by 3 or the result of dividing `a` by 3 is not in the set `arr`. Also, the value of `a * 2` was previously removed from `arr`. After appending `a * 2` to `res`, the length of `res` increases by 1, and the last element of `res` is now `a * 2`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `n` remains an integer value obtained from user input.
- `arr` remains a set containing at least one unique integer (with `a * 2` still removed).
- `a` remains the last element of `res`, which is now `a * 2`.
- `res` now contains the original elements plus the new element `a * 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer (with `a * 2` still removed), `a` is `a * 2`, `res` contains the original elements plus the new element `a * 2`.**
