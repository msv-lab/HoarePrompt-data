The provided code defines a lambda function `die` which takes any number of arguments, calls `pr` (another undefined function) with those arguments, and then exits the program with a status code of 0 using `exit(0)`. This means that any values or operations following this function call will not be executed because the program terminates immediately.

Given the initial state:
- The input is a list of `n` integer numbers (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`), each number is within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}`.
- The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence.
- `INF` is `float('+inf')`.
- The Python implementation is PyPy (indicated by `sys.subversion[0] == 'PyPy'`).
- `sys.stdout` is set to `io.BytesIO()` for handling output in memory.
- The `epr` lambda function is defined to write space-separated arguments to `sys.stderr`.

Since the `die` function is called with some arguments, the program will terminate, and no further operations will be performed. Therefore, the only impact of the code is the immediate termination of the program.

Output State: **the program terminates immediately**
