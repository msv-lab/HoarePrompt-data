The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop context is provided, the `continue` statement itself does not modify any variables. The values of the variables before the `continue` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` does not contain `a * 3` (if `a * 3` was originally in `arr`), `a` is the original value of `a`, `res` contains the original elements with `a * 3` added to the beginning**
