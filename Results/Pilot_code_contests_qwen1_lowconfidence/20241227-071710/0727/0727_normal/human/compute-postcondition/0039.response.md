The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific operation is performed in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer (one less than before), `a` is the last element of `res` and its value is divisible by 3, `res` is the list with the last element being `a / 3`**
