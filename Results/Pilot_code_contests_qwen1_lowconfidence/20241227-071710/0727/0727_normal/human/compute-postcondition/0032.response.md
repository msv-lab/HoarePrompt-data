The code `continue` is used within a loop to skip the remaining part of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop or conditional structure provided in the initial state, the effect of `continue` is not applicable here.

Given the initial state, the variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer, `res` is `[a * 3, a]`, `a` is equal to the integer in `res` (specifically the second element of `res`).**
