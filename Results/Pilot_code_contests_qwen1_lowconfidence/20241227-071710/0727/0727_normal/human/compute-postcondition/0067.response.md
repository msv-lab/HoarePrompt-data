`a` is assigned the value of `res[0]`. The value of `res[0]` is the first element of the list `res`, which originally contained the elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position. After this assignment, `a` takes the value of the first element of `res`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it. The state of `arr` also remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it. The state of `res` changes such that its first element is now assigned to `a`, but the rest of the elements remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` contains at least one unique integer, `a` is the first element of `res`, and `res` contains the original elements of `arr` plus the original value of `a` in the last position.**
