The given code snippet initializes a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This constant does not affect any existing variables or change their values. It merely introduces a new constant that can be used for modulo operations in subsequent code.

Since no variables are assigned or modified in this snippet, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence; MOD is 10 ** 9 + 7.**
