The code `sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()` changes the standard output stream to a BytesIO object, which is used to manipulate output data in memory. However, this does not affect the values of any variables or the initial state of the input list. Therefore, the only change is in the output handling mechanism.

Output State: **The input is a list of n integer numbers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each number is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence. INF is float('+inf'). The Python implementation is PyPy (indicated by sys.subversion[0] == 'PyPy'); sys.stdout is set to io.BytesIO() for handling output in memory.**
