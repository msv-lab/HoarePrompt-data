`res` is updated by appending the value of `a / 3` to it. The value of `a` is divisible by 3, so `a / 3` will be an integer. The initial state tells us that `a` is the last element of `res` and is divisible by 3, so after appending `a / 3` to `res`, the new last element of `res` will be `a / 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value obtained from user input, `arr` is a set containing at least one unique integer (one less than before), `a` is the last element of `res` and its value is divisible by 3, `res` is the list with the last element being `a / 3`**
