The function `func` accepts a list of `n` integer numbers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each number is within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^{18}`. The sequence can be rearranged such that each number is either twice the previous number or one third of the previous number in the sequence. After executing the function, the program state will be as follows:

1. The variable `n` holds the integer value of the length of the input list.
2. The variable `arr` is an empty set.
3. The variable `res` contains the original elements of the input list `arr` plus the last element of `arr` repeated until no further valid operations can be performed according to the rules inside the loop.
4. If no further valid operations can be performed, the program will print the elements in `res` using the `pr` function.
5. The program does not return anything explicitly; instead, it prints the result.
