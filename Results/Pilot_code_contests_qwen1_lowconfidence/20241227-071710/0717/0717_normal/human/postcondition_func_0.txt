The function `func_1` accepts three non-negative integers `r`, `g`, and `b` representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively. It processes these inputs by sorting them and then performing a series of operations to calculate a new value `t`. The function updates `g` and `b` by subtracting `r` and further adjusting based on the value of `g`. If `g` is 1 and `b` is greater than 1, or `g` is 2 and `b` is greater than 0, it increments `t` accordingly. Finally, the function calls another function `func_2` with the calculated value `t`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `r` is equal to `g` or `b`, the subsequent subtraction and modulo operations might affect the values of `g` and `b` in specific ways.
- If `g` is 0, the conditions `(g == 1 and b > 1)` and `(g == 2 and b > 0)` will not be met, so `t` will not be incremented.
- If `b` is less than or equal to 1 when `g` is 1, the condition `(g == 1 and b > 1)` will not be met, so `t` will not be incremented.
- If `b` is 0 when `g` is 2, the condition `(g == 2 and b > 0)` will not be met, so `t` will not be incremented.

After the function concludes, the program will have a new value `t` passed to `func_2`, and the original variables `r`, `g`, and `b` will be updated according to the operations performed within the function.
