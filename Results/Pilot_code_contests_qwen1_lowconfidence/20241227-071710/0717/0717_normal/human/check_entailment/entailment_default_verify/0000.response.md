Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly calculate the maximum number of tables that can be decorated. The function `func_2` is not called from the main logic, and the logic for calculating the maximum number of tables is flawed. Specifically, the corrected version of the program shows that the initial logic for determining the maximum number of tables is incorrect. The output hints confirm that `func_2` does not use the provided arguments `r`, `g`, and `b` for its intended purpose, further supporting the original assessment.
