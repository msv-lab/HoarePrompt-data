Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when the number of green or blue balloons is less than the number of red balloons initially, but the remaining green and blue balloons after decorating with red ones are enough to form more tables. 

For example, consider the input `2 1 3`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of tables that can be decorated is 1 ("rgb"). However, the provided code incorrectly calculates the number of tables as 2 because it does not properly account for the remaining green and blue balloons after decorating with red ones. 

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the remaining green and blue balloons after using some of them to pair with red balloons are still sufficient to form additional tables. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario.
