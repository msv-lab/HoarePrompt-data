Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases correctly as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not ensure that no more than one pair of the same color is used to decorate a table. For example, consider the input `1 1 1`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of tables that can be decorated is 1, because using one red, one green, and one blue balloon is the only way to satisfy the requirement of no three balloons of the same color on a single table. However, the current implementation allows for `t = 1` in this case, which is correct. But the implementation does not handle the case where `g` is 1 and `b` is 2, or `g` is 2 and `b` is 1, which should also allow for one more table to be decorated.

For instance, if the input is `1 2 1`, the code will only allow for 1 table to be decorated, which is incorrect. The correct number of tables that can be decorated is 2, using the combinations (r, g, b) and (r, b, g).

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
