Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the maximum number of tables that can be decorated. Specifically, the logic to update `g` and `b` after subtracting `r` is flawed. The calculation of `t` does not account for all possible distributions of the remaining balloons after the initial subtraction. For example, consider the case where `r = 1`, `g = 1`, and `b = 1`. The code will set `t = 1` initially, then `g -= 1` and `b -= 1`, leaving `g = 0` and `b = 0`. However, the final conditions `(g == 1 and b > 1)` and `(g == 2 and b > 0)` will not be met, so `t` will not be incremented, resulting in `t = 1` instead of the correct answer of `1`. 

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where `g` or `b` becomes negative after the subtraction, which could lead to incorrect results. The correct approach would involve ensuring that the remaining balloons (`g` and `b`) can form complete sets of three different colored balloons.
