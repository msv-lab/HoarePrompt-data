You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have r red, g green and b blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn't have the same color. What maximum number t of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?

Your task is to write a program that for given values r, g and b will find the maximum number t of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.

Input

The single line contains three integers r, g and b (0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 2·109) — the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.

Output

Print a single integer t — the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.

Note

In the first sample you can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: "rgg", "gbb", "brr", "rrg", where "r", "g" and "b" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three non-negative integers `r`, `g`, and `b` representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively. It processes these inputs by sorting them and then performing a series of operations to calculate a new value `t`. The function updates `g` and `b` by subtracting `r` and further adjusting based on the value of `g`. If `g` is 1 and `b` is greater than 1, or `g` is 2 and `b` is greater than 0, it increments `t` accordingly. Finally, the function calls another function `func_2` with the calculated value `t`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `r` is equal to `g` or `b`, the subsequent subtraction and modulo operations might affect the values of `g` and `b` in specific ways.
- If `g` is 0, the conditions `(g == 1 and b > 1)` and `(g == 2 and b > 0)` will not be met, so `t` will not be incremented.
- If `b` is less than or equal to 1 when `g` is 1, the condition `(g == 1 and b > 1)` will not be met, so `t` will not be incremented.
- If `b` is 0 when `g` is 2, the condition `(g == 2 and b > 0)` will not be met, so `t` will not be incremented.

After the function concludes, the program will have a new value `t` passed to `func_2`, and the original variables `r`, `g`, and `b` will be updated according to the operations performed within the function.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""

 Output hints for function2:  This function accepts variable arguments `r`, `g`, and `b`, which are non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively. It does not directly use these arguments within the function. Instead, it iterates over a provided iterable `args`, writing each element to a file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) separated by a specified separator `sep`. After the loop, it appends a specified end character (defaulting to a newline) to the file and flushes the file buffer if requested. The function does not return any value.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
