The code writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not change any of the existing variables' values. The only change is the content of the file, which now includes the string representation of `x`. However, since no direct assignment or modification of variables occurs in this line of code, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable (with at least one element remaining), and a string representation of `x` is appended to the file.**
