The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file, but it does not affect the variables `r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, or `args`. The values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is a boolean, and `args` is a non-empty iterable.**
