The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file, but does not affect the variables `r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, or `args`. The initial state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and a string representation of `x` is written to the file.**
