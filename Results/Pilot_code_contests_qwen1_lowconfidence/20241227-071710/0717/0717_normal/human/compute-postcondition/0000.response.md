The provided code snippet does not perform any operations on the variables `r`, `g`, or `b`. Instead, it provides a docstring for a function that would print these values to a stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`). Since no operations are performed on the variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer**
