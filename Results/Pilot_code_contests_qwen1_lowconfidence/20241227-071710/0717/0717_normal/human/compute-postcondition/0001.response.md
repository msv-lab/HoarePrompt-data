The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` is removing the `sep` and `file` keys from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigning default values if those keys are not present. However, since the initial state does not include `kwargs`, these operations do not affect the given variables `r`, `g`, and `b`. Therefore, the values of `r`, `g`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer**
