`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. The value of `sep` is not specified in the code snippet, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that the operation affects the file writing process but does not change any variable values. The variables `r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, `args`, and the string representation of `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable (with at least one element remaining), and a string representation of `x` is written to the file.**
