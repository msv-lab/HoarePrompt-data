`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the write buffer for the file object `file`. This operation does not change the values of any variables except potentially affecting the state of the file object itself. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable (possibly empty), `file` is flushed, and the result of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True**
