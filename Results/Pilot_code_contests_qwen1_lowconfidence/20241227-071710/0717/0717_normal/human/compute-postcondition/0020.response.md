The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the `file` object by writing the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to it. This means that `file` will write either the value of `kwargs['end']` if it exists, or the default value `\n` if `kwargs['end']` does not exist.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is a non-negative integer
- `g` is a non-negative integer
- `b` is a non-negative integer
- `at_start` is False
- `args` is an iterable (possibly empty)

The code does not directly affect the values of `r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, or `args`. It only writes to the `file` object. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable (possibly empty), and `file` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to it.**
