The function `func_2` accepts a variable number of parameters `r`, `g`, and `b`. These parameters are non-negative integers representing the number of red, green, and blue balloons respectively. 

Case_1: If `r`, `g`, and `b` are all non-negative integers, the function does not return any specific value mentioned in the output. Since no return value is specified for this case, we infer that the function may return None or could have a default return value not listed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept variable non-negative integer parameters `r`, `g`, and `b` and does not explicitly return any specific value based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts variable non-negative integer parameters `r`, `g`, and `b` and does not explicitly return any specific value based on the given constraints.**
