The code `file.write(sep)` does not affect the values of the variables `r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, or `args`. It writes the value of `sep` to the file, but this operation does not change the values of any variables within the program's state.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` must be a non-empty iterable**
