According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will only execute if `args` is a non-empty iterable. 

Before the loop starts:
- `r` is a non-negative integer
- `g` is a non-negative integer
- `b` is a non-negative integer
- `at_start` is True

To ensure the loop can execute, `args` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is True, `args` must be a non-empty iterable**
