The code `at_start = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `at_start`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and a string representation of `x` is written to the file.**
