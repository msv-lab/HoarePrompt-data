The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file, but does not affect the values of the other variables. The state of the file object and the value of `sep` are updated, but these changes are not reflected in the variables given.

Output State: **`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable**
