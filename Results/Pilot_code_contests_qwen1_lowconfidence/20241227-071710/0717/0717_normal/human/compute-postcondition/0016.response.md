Postcondition: ***`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable (with at least one element remaining), and a string representation of `x` is written to the file. Since the `if` condition is `not at_start`, which is already given as False, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
