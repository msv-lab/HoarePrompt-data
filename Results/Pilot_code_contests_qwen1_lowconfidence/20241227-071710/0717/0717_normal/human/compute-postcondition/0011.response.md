Postcondition: ***`r` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable. Since the condition `not at_start` does not change the values of `r`, `g`, `b`, `at_start`, or `args`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
