`j` is 0, so `str(j)` is the string `"0"`. Multiplying this string by `mn9s[j]` results in an empty string because `mn9s[j]` is non-negative and multiplying any string by 0 results in an empty string. The value of `mxZString[0]` is updated by concatenating this empty string to it. Therefore, `mxZString[0]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i10` is within [0, 9], `zeros` is non-negative, `mn` is a valid value (â‰¥ 0), `j` is 0, `mxZString[0]` is unchanged**
