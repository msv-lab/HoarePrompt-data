`mxZString[0]` is updated by appending `str(j) * mn9s[j]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so `str(j)` is `"2"`. Therefore, `mxZString[0]` is updated by appending `"2"` repeated `mn9s[2]` times to its current value.

The output state is:
**`i10` is within [0, 9], `zeros` is non-negative, `mn` is a valid value (â‰¥ 0), `j` is 2, `mxZString[0]` is the current value of `mxZString[0]` concatenated with `"2"` repeated `mn9s[2]` times, `mxZString[1]` is `"9"` repeated `mn` times plus `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times**
