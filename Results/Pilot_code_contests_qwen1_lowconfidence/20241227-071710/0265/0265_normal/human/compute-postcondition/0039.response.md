Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Conditions**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 9.
2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer
   - `digit` is the last character of `digits`
   - `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys
   - `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`
   - `iTen` is 1
   - `mxZeros` is 0
   - `countsa` is a copy of `baseCounts` with the value at index `j` decremented by `mn`
   - `countsb` is a copy of `baseCounts` with the value at index `9 - j` decremented by `1 + mn`
   - `zeros` is `1 + mn`
   - `i10` is 9
   - `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros
   - `mni10` is 9
   - `print output` is a dictionary with specific values
   - `j9` is `9 - j`
   - `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[j]` and `countsb[9 - j]` and is greater than 0
   - `countsb[j9]` is `baseCounts[9 - j] - 1 - mn`
   - `mn9s[j]` is `mn`

3. **Determine Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `j` ranges from 0 to 9, the next valid `j` value after the current `j` is `(j + 1) % 10`.

Given the current state, the only variable that needs to be updated is `j`.

4. **Update the States**:
   - `j` should be updated to `(j + 1) % 10`.
   - All other states remain the same as they are not dependent on `j`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the last character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`, `iTen` is 1, `mxZeros` is 0, `countsa` is a copy of `baseCounts` with the value at index `j` decremented by `mn`, `countsb` is a copy of `baseCounts` with the value at index `9 - j` decremented by `1 + mn`, `zeros` is `1 + mn`, `i10` is 9, `mn9s` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `mni10` is 9, `print output` is `{i: 1, countsa: baseCounts.copy(), countsb: baseCounts.copy() - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1]}, mxZeros: 0, mni10: 9}`, `j9` is `9 - j`, `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[j]` and `countsb[9 - j]` and is greater than 0, `countsb[j9]` is `baseCounts[9 - j] - 1 - mn`, `mn9s[j]` is `mn`, `j` is `(j + 1) % 10`**.
