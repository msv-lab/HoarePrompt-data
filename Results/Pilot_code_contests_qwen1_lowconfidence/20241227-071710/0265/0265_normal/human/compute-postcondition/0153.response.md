The code snippet updates `mxZString[0]` by appending `str(i) * mni10` and `'0' * mn0` to the existing value of `mxZString[0]`. However, the initial values of `i`, `mni10`, and `mn0` are not provided. Since these values are necessary to determine the exact updated value of `mxZString[0]`, we cannot specify the exact new value without knowing them. 

Given the initial state where `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, the updated `mxZString[0]` will include the additional content as specified in the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 10, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and additionally `str(i) * mni10` and `'0' * mn0` are appended; `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"0"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times.**
