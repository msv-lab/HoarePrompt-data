The code `zeros += mn` increments the value of `zeros` by `mn`. The value of `mn` is known from the initial state, and `zeros` was initially `1 + mn`. So, after executing this line, `zeros` will be `1 + mn + mn`, which simplifies to `1 + 2 * mn`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`countsa[j]` is decreased by `mn`; `countsa[j + 1]` is decreased by `mn`; `countsb[j9 + 1]` is decreased by `mn`; `countsb` is a list of 10 integers; `zeros` is `1 + 2 * mn`; `i10` is `10 - (j + 1)'; `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros with the j-th element equal to `mn`; `countsb[i10]` is decreased by 1; `j9` is `pair9s[j]`; `countsb[j9]` is decreased by `mn`.**
