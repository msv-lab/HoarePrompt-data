`mxZString[1]` is assigned the value of itself plus the string representation of `j` repeated `countsb[j]` times. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so we need to append the string "2" repeated `countsb[2]` times to `mxZString[1]`.

From the initial state:
- `mxZString[0]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsa[1]` times, followed by "2" repeated `countsa[2]` times.
- `mxZString[1]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times appended to it.

After executing the code:
- `mxZString[1]` will now be its initial value plus "2" repeated `countsb[2]` times.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `mxZString[0]` remains unchanged.
- `mxZString[1]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times, "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times, "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times, and then "2" repeated `countsb[2]` times.

Output State: **`mxZString[0]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsa[1]` times, followed by "2" repeated `countsa[2]` times; `mxZString[1]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times, "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times, and "2" repeated `countsb[2]` times.**
