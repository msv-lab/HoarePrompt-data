Initially, `j` is 1, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, and `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times.

The code snippet `mxZString[0] += str(j) * mn9s[j]` modifies `mxZString[0]`. Here, `str(j)` converts `j` (which is 1) to the string `"1"`, and `mn9s[j]` is `mn9s[1]` since `j` is 1. So, `"1"` is repeated `mn9s[1]` times and concatenated to `mxZString[0]`.

Since `mxZString[0]` was originally its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, after adding `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, the updated `mxZString[0]` will be its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times**
