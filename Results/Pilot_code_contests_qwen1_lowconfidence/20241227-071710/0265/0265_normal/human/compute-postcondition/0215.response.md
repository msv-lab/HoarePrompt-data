According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop condition is `j in range(10)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `j` will be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 1.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `i10` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
- `zeros` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
- `mn` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
- `mxZString[0]` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
- `mxZString[1]` remains `"9"` repeated `mn` times because it is not affected by the loop.

State: **`i10` is within [0, 9], `zeros` is non-negative, `mn` is a valid value (â‰¥ 0), `j` is 1, `mxZString[0]` is unchanged, `mxZString[1]` is `"9"` repeated `mn` times**
