`countsa[i]` is decremented by 1. Since `i10` is defined as `10 - i`, it does not get affected by this operation. The value of `zeros`, `mn9s`, and `mni10` remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in this operation. 

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `baseCounts` remains the same as it was not affected.
- `countsa` is updated such that the element at index `i` is decreased by 1.
- `countsb` and `zeros` remain unchanged.
- `i10` remains `10 - i`.
- `mn9s` remains a list of 10 zeros.
- `mni10` is the minimum value among `1`, `countsa[i]`, and `countsb[10-i]`.

Output State: **`baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers, `countsa` is a list of 10 integers where `countsa[i]` is decreased by 1, `countsb` is a list of 10 integers, `zeros` is 0, `i10` is `10 - i`, `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros, `mni10` is the minimum value among `1`, `countsa[i] - 1`, and `countsb[10-i]`.**
