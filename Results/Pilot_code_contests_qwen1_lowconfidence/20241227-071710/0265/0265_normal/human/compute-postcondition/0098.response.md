The code `zeros = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `zeros`. This changes the value of `zeros` from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial state.

Output State: **`countsa[i]` is decreased by 1, `countsb` is a list of 10 integers, `zeros` is 1, `i10` is `10 - i`, `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros, `countsb[i10]` is decreased by 1**
