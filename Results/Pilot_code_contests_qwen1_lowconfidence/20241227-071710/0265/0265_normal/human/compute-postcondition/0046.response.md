Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the last character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`, `iTen` is 1, `mxZeros` is 0, `countsa` and `countsb` are copies of `baseCounts` with certain adjustments based on the value of `j` and `mn`, `zeros` is adjusted based on the value of `mn`, `i10` is 9, `mn9s` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` with `mn9s[j]` being `mn`, `mni10` is 9, `print output` is `{i: 1, countsa: baseCounts.copy(), countsb: baseCounts.copy() - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1]}, mxZeros: 0, mni10: 9}`, `j9` is `9 - j`, `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[j]` and `countsb[9 - j]` and is greater than 0, `j` is `(j + 1) % 10`. If `mn > 0`, `countsa[j]` is decremented by `2 * mn` and `countsb[9 - j]` is decremented by `1 + mn`; otherwise, `countsa[j]` is decremented by `mn` and `countsb[9 - j]` is decremented by `1 + mn`.***
