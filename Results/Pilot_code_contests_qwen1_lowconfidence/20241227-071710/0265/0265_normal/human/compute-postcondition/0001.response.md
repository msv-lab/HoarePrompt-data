State before the loop starts: `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105; `pair9s` is an empty dictionary `{}`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(10)`, which means `i` should be between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

Since the initial state already indicates that `digits` is a string representing a positive integer and `pair9s` is an empty dictionary, no adjustments are needed for these variables to ensure the loop can execute.
