`j9` is assigned the value of `pair9s[j]`. The value of `j9` was previously `pair9s[j + 1]`, so this assignment changes its value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`countsa[j + 1]` is decreased by `mn`; `countsb[j9 + 1]` is decreased by `mn`; `countsb` is a list of 10 integers; `zeros` is `1 + mn`; `i10` is `10 - (j + 1)`; `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros with the j-th element equal to `mn`; `countsb[i10]` is decreased by 1; `j9` is `pair9s[j]`; `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[j + 1]` and `countsb[j9 + 1]` and is greater than 0**
