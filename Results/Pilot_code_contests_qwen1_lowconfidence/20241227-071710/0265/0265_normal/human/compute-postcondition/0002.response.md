The code snippet `pair9s[i] = 9 - i` assigns the value `9 - i` to the key `i` in the dictionary `pair9s`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, we assume `i` is an integer variable. The operation will create or update the entry in the dictionary with the key `i` and the value `9 - i`.

Given the initial state:
- `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105.
- `pair9s` is an empty dictionary `{}`.

After the code executes, `pair9s` will contain the key-value pairs where each key is an integer `i` and each value is `9 - i`. However, since `i` is not defined before the assignment, we cannot specify exact values for `pair9s` without knowing what `i` is. We only know that `pair9s` will have entries with keys and values following the pattern `9 - i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105; `pair9s` is a dictionary with keys being integers and values being `9 - i` for those keys.**
