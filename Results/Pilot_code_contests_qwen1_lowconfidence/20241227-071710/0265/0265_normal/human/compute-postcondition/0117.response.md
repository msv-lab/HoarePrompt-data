Output State: **`countsa[k + 1]` and `countsa[k + 2]` are each decreased by `mn`; `countsb[(k + 1)9 + 1]` is decreased by `mn`; `countsb` is a list of 10 integers; `zeros` is `1 + 2 * mn`; `i10` is `8 - k`; `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros with the (k)-th element equal to `mn`; `countsb[8 - k]` is decreased by 1; `j9` is assigned the value of `pair9s[j9]`; `countsb[j9]` is decreased by `mn`; `mn9s[k + 1]` is `mn`; if `mn > 0`, then `countsa[k + 1]` is also decreased by `mn`.**

Explanation:
- The line `j9 = pair9s[j]` assigns the value of `pair9s[j]` to `j9`.
- The values of `countsa[k + 1]` and `countsa[k + 2]` are already updated by `-mn`.
- The value of `countsb[(k + 1)9 + 1]` is already updated by `-mn`.
- The value of `countsb[8 - k]` is already decreased by `1`.
- The value of `countsb[j9]` is now decreased by `mn`.
- The value of `mn9s[k + 1]` remains `mn`.
- The value of `zeros` remains `1 + 2 * mn`.
- The value of `i10` remains `8 - k`.
- The value of `mn9s` remains a list of 10 zeros with the (k)-th element equal to `mn`.
- The value of `j9` is now `pair9s[j9]`.
- The value of `countsa[k + 1]` is decreased by `mn` only if `mn > 0`.
