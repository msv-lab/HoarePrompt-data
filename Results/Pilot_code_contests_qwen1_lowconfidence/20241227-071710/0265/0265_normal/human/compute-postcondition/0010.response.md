`baseCounts[int(digit)]` is incremented by 1. The value of `digit` is the first character of `digits`, so `int(digit)` converts this character to an integer. This integer is used to access the corresponding index in the `baseCounts` list and increment its value by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the first character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 zeros where the element at index `int(digit)` is incremented by 1.**
