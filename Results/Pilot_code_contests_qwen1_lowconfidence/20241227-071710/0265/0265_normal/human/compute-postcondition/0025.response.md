The given code snippet prints the values of `i`, `countsa`, `countsb`, `mxZeros`, and `mni10`. These values are determined from the initial state.

- `i` is initially set to `1`.
- `countsa` is a copy of `baseCounts`.
- `countsb` is a copy of `baseCounts`.
- `mxZeros` is initially `0`.
- `mni10` is initially `9`.

Since no changes are made to these variables within the provided code snippet, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer; `digit` is the last character of `digits`; `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys; `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`; `iTen` is 1; `mxZeros` is 0; `countsa` is a copy of `baseCounts`; `countsb` is a copy of `baseCounts`; `zeros` is 0; `i10` is 9; `mn9s` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`; `mni10` is 9; print output is `{i: 1, countsa: baseCounts.copy(), countsb: baseCounts.copy(), mxZeros: 0, mni10: 9}`.**
