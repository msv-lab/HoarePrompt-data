Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the last character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`, `iTen` is 1, `mxZeros` is 0, `countsa` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) is adjusted according to whether `i` is 9 or not, `countsb` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) is similarly adjusted, `zeros` is the total number of valid pairs `(i, 9-i)` found during the loop, `i10` is 9, `mn9s` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `j` is the maximum `mn` value for that `j` found during the loop, `mni10` is 9, `print output` is `{i: 1, countsa: baseCounts.copy() - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -zeros/2], countsb: baseCounts.copy() - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -zeros/2 - 1]}, mxZeros: 0, mni10: 9}. If `mni10 > 0`, `zeros` is updated based on the digit being processed, otherwise the state remains as in the else part, which does not change the values of `countsa`, `countsb`, `mxZeros`, `mni10`, and `print output`.***
