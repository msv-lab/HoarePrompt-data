The code initializes the variable `zeros` to 0. This does not affect the values of `baseCounts`, `countsa`, or `countsb`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers, `countsa` is a list of 10 integers containing the same values as `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a list of 10 integers containing the same values as `baseCounts`, `zeros` is 0**
