Postcondition: ***`baseCounts`, `countsa`, `countsb`, `zeros`, `i10`, `mn9s`, `pair9s`, `mxZString`, and `v` are as follows:
- If `mxZeros < zeros`, then `j` is 10, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and additionally `str(i) * mni10` and `'0' * mn0` are appended; `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"0"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and `str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0` is appended; `v` is 2.
- If `mxZeros >= zeros`, then no changes are made to these variables.***
