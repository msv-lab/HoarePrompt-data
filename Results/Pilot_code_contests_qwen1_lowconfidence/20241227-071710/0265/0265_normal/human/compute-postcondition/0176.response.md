Postcondition: ***`j` is 0; `j9` is the first element of `pairs`; `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[0]` and `countsb[j9]`. If `mn` is greater than 0, then `countsb[j9]` is decremented by `mn`, `zeros` is incremented by `mn`, and `mn9s[0]` is set to `mn`. Otherwise, no changes are made to these variables.***
