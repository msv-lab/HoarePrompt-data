According to the given for loop statement, the loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than 10.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 1
- `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times
- `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2.

Therefore, we need to update the state as follows:
- `j` will be incremented to 2
- The values of `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]` remain unchanged since they are not modified within the loop.

State: **`j` is 2; `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times; `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times**
