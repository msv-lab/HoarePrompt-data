`countsb` is assigned a shallow copy of `baseCounts`. This means that `countsb` will have the same values as `baseCounts`, but they are two separate objects (shallow copy). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`baseCounts` is as before, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `zeros` is as before, `i10` is as before, `mn9s` is as before, `pair9s` is as before, `mxZString` is as before, and `v` is as before.**
