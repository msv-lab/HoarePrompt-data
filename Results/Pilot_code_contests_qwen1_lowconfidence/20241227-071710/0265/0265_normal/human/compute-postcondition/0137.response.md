The code snippet updates `mxZString[0]` by appending the string representation of `j` repeated `countsa[j]` times. Given the initial state, let's break down the process:

- Initial State: `j` is 1, `mxZString[0]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times, `mxZString[1]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times appended to it.

When `j` is 1, `countsa[j]` is `countsa[1]`. So, `mxZString[0]` is updated to append "1" repeated `countsa[1]` times to its current value.

Therefore, the updated `mxZString[0]` will be the original value of `mxZString[0]` followed by "1" repeated `countsa[1]` times. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `mxZString[0]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsa[1]` times; `mxZString[1]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times appended to it.**
