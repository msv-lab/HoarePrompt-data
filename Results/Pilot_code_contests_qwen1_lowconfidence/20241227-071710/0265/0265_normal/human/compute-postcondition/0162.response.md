`mn9s` is assigned the value of a list containing 10 zeros, i.e., `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`baseCounts` is as before, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`, `zeros` is 0, `i10` is `10 - i_initial`, `mn9s` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `mn9s` is as before, `pair9s` is as before, `mxZString` is as before, and `v` is as before.**
