The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `iTen`. This assignment does not affect the values of `digits`, `digit`, `pair9s`, or `baseCounts`. Therefore, the only change is the new value of `iTen`.

Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the last character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`, `iTen` is -1.**
