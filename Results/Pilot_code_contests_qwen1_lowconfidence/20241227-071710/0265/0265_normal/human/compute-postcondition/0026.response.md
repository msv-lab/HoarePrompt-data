Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the last character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`, `iTen` is 1, `mxZeros` is 0, `countsa` is a copy of `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a copy of `baseCounts`, `zeros` is 0, `i10` is 9, `mn9s` is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `mni10` is 9, print output is `{i: 1, countsa: baseCounts.copy(), countsb: baseCounts.copy(), mxZeros: 0, mni10: 9}`, and the current value of `mni10` is greater than 0**
