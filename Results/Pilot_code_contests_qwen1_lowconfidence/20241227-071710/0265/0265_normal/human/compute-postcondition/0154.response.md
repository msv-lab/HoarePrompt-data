Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 10.
   - `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and additionally `str(i) * mni10` and `'0' * mn0` are appended.
   - `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"0"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times.

2. **Code to Execute:**
   ```python
   mxZString[1] += str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0
   ```

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code appends `str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0` to `mxZString[1]`.
   - Since `mxZString[1]` was already defined in the initial state, appending to it means we are modifying `mxZString[1]`.

4. **Updated State:**
   - `j` remains 10 (unchanged).
   - `mxZString[0]` remains unchanged (as no operation was performed on it).
   - `mxZString[1]` is updated by adding `str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0` to its current value.

Given the above steps, the final output state is:

Output State: **`j` is 10, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and additionally `str(i) * mni10` and `'0' * mn0` are appended; `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"0"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and `str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0` is appended.**
