Postcondition: ***`baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers, `countsa` is a list of 10 integers representing the remaining counts after all possible overlaps, `countsb` is a list of 10 integers representing the remaining counts after all possible overlaps, `zeros` is the total number of matches found, `i10` is `10 - i`, `mn9s` is a list of 10 integers where the j-th element is `mni10` if `mni10 > 0` for the j-th iteration, and `pair9s[j]` is the corresponding value for each j.***
