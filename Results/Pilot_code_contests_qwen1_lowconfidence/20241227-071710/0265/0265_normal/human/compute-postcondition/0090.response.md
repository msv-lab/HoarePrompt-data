The code snippet creates a new list `countsb` that is a shallow copy of `baseCounts`. This means that `countsb` will contain the same values as `baseCounts`, but `countsb` and `baseCounts` will be two separate lists. No variables are assigned new values other than creating this new list.

Output State: **`baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers, `countsa` is a list of 10 integers containing the same values as `baseCounts`, `countsb` is a list of 10 integers containing the same values as `baseCounts`**
