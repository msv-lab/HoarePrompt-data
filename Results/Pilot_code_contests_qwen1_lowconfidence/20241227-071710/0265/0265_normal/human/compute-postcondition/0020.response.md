The code snippet creates a new list `countsb` that is a shallow copy of the list `baseCounts`. This means that both `countsb` and `baseCounts` will initially contain the same values, which are the counts of digits from 0 to 9 in the string `digits`.

No other variables are affected, so the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0; `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer; `digit` is the last character of `digits`; `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys; `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`; `iTen` is 1; `mxZeros` is 0; `countsa` is a copy of `baseCounts`; `countsb` is a copy of `baseCounts`.**
