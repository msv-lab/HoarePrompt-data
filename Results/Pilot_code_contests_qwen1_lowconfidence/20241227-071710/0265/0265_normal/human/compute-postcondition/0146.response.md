According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes 1.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `mxZString[0]` remains unchanged.
- `mxZString[1]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`j` is 1, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times**
