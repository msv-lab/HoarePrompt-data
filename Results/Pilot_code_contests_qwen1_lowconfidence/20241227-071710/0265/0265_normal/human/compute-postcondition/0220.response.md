`mxZString[1]` is updated by appending `str(9 - j) * mn9s[j]` to its current value. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so `str(9 - j)` is `"7"`. Therefore, `mxZString[1]` is updated by appending `"7"` repeated `mn9s[2]` times to its current value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i10` is within [0, 9], `zeros` is non-negative, `mn` is a valid value (â‰¥ 0), `j` is 2, `mxZString[0]` is the current value of `mxZString[0]` concatenated with `"2"` repeated `mn9s[2]` times, `mxZString[1]` is the current value of `mxZString[1]` concatenated with `"7"` repeated `mn9s[2]` times, `mn9s[1]` is used in the calculation for updating `mxZString[1]`**
