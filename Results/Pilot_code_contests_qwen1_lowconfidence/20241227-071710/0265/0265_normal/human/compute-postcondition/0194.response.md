Postcondition: ***`baseCounts` is a shallow copy of itself, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` where each element `countsa[i]` is decremented by the maximum possible value `mn` for each iteration, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` where each element `countsb[i10]` (where `i10 = 10 - i`) is decremented by the maximum possible value `mn` for each iteration, `zeros` is the sum of all `mn` values where `mn` is greater than 0, `i10` is `10 - i_initial`, `mn9s` is an array where each element `mn9s[j]` is set to the maximum possible value `mn` for each iteration, `mxZString` is as before, `v` is as before. If `mni10 > 0`, these operations are performed. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
