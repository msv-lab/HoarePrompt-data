Output State: **`j` is 10, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times; `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"0"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 9`, inclusive.
   - For each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
   - After 10 iterations (from `j = 0` to `j = 9`), `j` will be 10.

2. **Effect on `mxZString[0]`**:
   - Initially, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times.
   - For each iteration, `mxZString[0]` gets appended with `str(j) * mn9s[j]`.
   - After 10 iterations, `mxZString[0]` will have `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times.

3. **Effect on `mxZString[1]`**:
   - Initially, `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and then `"1"` repeated `countsb[0]` times, `"2"` repeated `countsb[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `countsb[9]` times.
   - For each iteration, `mxZString[1]` gets appended with `str(9 - j) * mn9s[j]`.
   - After 10 iterations, `mxZString[1]` will have `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"0"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times.

Since the loop runs 10 times and `j` starts from 0, the final state after all iterations will match the above description.
