Postcondition: **`baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers, `countsa` is a list of 10 integers with the first element decreased by `min(countsa[0], countsb[0])`, `countsb` is a list of 10 integers where the first element is further decreased by `min(countsa[0], countsb[0])`, `zeros` is the total number of matches found plus `mn0`, `i10` is `10 - i`, `mn9s` is a list of 10 integers where the j-th element is `mni10` if `mni10 > 0` for the j-th iteration, `pair9s[j]` is the corresponding value for each j, `mn0` is the minimum of `countsa[0]` and `countsb[0]`, and the current value of `mxZeros` is less than the current value of `zeros`**
