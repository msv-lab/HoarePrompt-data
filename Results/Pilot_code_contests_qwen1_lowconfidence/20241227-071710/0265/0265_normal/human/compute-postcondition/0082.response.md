`mxZString[1]` is updated by adding the string representation of `9 - j` (which is `8`) repeated `mn9s[j]` times to its current value. Given that `j` is initially `1`, `9 - j` equals `8`. The value of `mn9s[j]` (i.e., `mn9s[1]`) determines how many times `"8"` is repeated.

Let's denote the original value of `mxZString[1]` as `original_value`. According to the initial state, `mxZString[1]` is `original_value + "9" repeated `mn9s[0]` times + "1" repeated `mn9s[1]` times.

After executing the line of code, `mxZString[1]` becomes `original_value + "9" repeated `mn9s[0]` times + "1" repeated `mn9s[1]` times + "8" repeated `mn9s[1]` times.

Thus, the Output State is:
**`j` is 1; `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times and `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times; `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, and `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times.**
