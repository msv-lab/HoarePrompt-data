Postcondition: ***`countsa[j]` is decreased by `mn`; `countsb[j9]` is decreased by `mn`; `countsb` is a list of 10 integers; `zeros` is `1 + mn`; `i10` is `10 - i`; `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros with the j-th element equal to `mn`; `countsb[i10]` is decreased by 1; `j9` is `pair9s[j]`; `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[j]` and `countsb[j9]` and is greater than 0.*** 

(Note: Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part directly serves as the overall postcondition of the if-else block.)
