Postcondition: ***`countsa[j]` and `countsa[j + 1]` are each decreased by `mn`; `countsb[j9 + 1]` is decreased by `mn`; `countsb` is a list of 10 integers; `zeros` is `1 + 2 * mn`; `i10` is `10 - (j + 1)`; `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros with the j-th element equal to `mn`; `countsb[i10]` is decreased by 1; `j9` is `pair9s[j]`; `countsb[j9]` is decreased by `mn`; `mn9s[j]` is `mn`. If `mn > 0`, then `countsa[j]` is also decreased by `mn`.***
