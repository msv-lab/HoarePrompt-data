Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the last character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`, `iTen` is 1, `mxZeros` is greater than zeros, `countsa` is a list of 10 integers where the first element is `baseCounts[0] - zeros/2 - 1`, `countsb` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) is similarly adjusted, with the first element now being `0`, `zeros` is the original value of `zeros` plus `baseCounts[0] - zeros/2 - 1`, `i10` is 9, `mn9s` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `j` is the maximum `mn` value for that `j` found during the loop, `mni10` is 9, `print output` is `{i: 1, countsa: baseCounts.copy() - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -zeros/2], countsb: baseCounts.copy() - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -zeros/2 - 1]}, mxZeros: greater than zeros, mni10: 9, mn0: baseCounts[0] - zeros/2 - 1`***
