The value of `zeros` is incremented by `mn`. The previous value of `zeros` was `zeros + mn`, so adding `mn` to it results in `zeros + mn + mn`, which simplifies to `zeros + 2*mn`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 2; `j9` is `pair9s[2]`; `countsa[2]` is `countsa[2] - mn`; `countsb[j9]` is `countsb[j9] - mn`; `zeros` is `zeros + 2*mn`; `mn9s[2]` is `mn`**
