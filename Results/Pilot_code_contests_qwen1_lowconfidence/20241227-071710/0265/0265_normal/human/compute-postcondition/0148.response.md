`mxZString[1]` is updated by adding the string representation of `9 - j` (which is `8` since `j` is `1`) repeated `mn9s[j]` (which is `mn9s[1]`) times to its current value. The current value of `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times. After the operation, `mxZString[1]` becomes its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times; `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times**
