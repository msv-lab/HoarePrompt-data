The code updates `mxZString[1]` by appending the string representation of `9 - j` (which is `9 - 2 = 7`) repeated `mn9s[j]` (where `j` is 2, so `mn9s[2]`) times to `mxZString[1]`.

From the initial state, `j` is 2, `mxZString[0]` retains its original value plus the specified strings, and `mxZString[1]` retains its original value plus the specified strings.

Since `j` is 2, `9 - j` is `9 - 2 = 7`. Therefore, `mxZString[1]` is updated by appending `"7"` repeated `mn9s[2]` times to its current value.

Output State: **`j` is 2; `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times plus `"2"` repeated `mn9s[2]` times; `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times plus `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times plus `"7"` repeated `mn9s[2]` times**
