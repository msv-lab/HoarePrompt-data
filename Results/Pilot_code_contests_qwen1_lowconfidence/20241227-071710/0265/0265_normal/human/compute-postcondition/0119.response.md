`countsa[j]` is decreased by `mn`. The value of `mn` is `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `countsa[k + 1]` and `countsa[k + 2]` are each decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `countsa[k + 1]` is also decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])` if `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9]) > 0`; `countsa[k + 1]` is decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `countsa[k + 2]` is decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `countsb[(k + 1)9 + 1]` is decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `countsb` is a list of 10 integers; `zeros` is `1 + 2 * mn`; `i10` is `8 - k`; `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros with the (k)-th element equal to `mn`; `countsb[8 - k]` is decreased by 1; `j9` is assigned the value of `pair9s[j9]`; `countsb[j9]` is decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `mn9s[k + 1]` is `mn`; `countsa[j]` is decreased by `mn`.

Output State: **`countsa[k + 1]` and `countsa[k + 2]` are each decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `countsa[k + 1]` is also decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])` if `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9]) > 0`; `countsa[k + 1]` is decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `countsa[k + 2]` is decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `countsb[(k + 1)9 + 1]` is decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `countsb` is a list of 10 integers; `zeros` is `1 + 2 * min(countsa[j], countsb[j9])`; `i10` is `8 - k`; `mn9s` is a list of 10 zeros with the (k)-th element equal to `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9]); `countsb[8 - k]` is decreased by 1; `j9` is assigned the value of `pair9s[j9]`; `countsb[j9]` is decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9]); `mn9s[k + 1]` is `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9]); `countsa[j]` is decreased by `min(countsa[j], countsb[j9]]`.**
