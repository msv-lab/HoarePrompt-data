`countsb[0]` is decremented by `mn0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`countsa[0]` is `countsa[0] - mn0`, `countsa` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` where each element `countsa[i]` is decremented by the maximum possible value `mn` for each iteration except for the first element, `countsb` is a shallow copy of `baseCounts` where each element `countsb[i10]` (where `i10 = 10 - i`) is decremented by the maximum possible value `mn` for each iteration minus `mn0`, `zeros` is the sum of all `mn` values where `mn` is greater than 0, `i10` is `10 - i_initial`, `mn9s` is an array where each element `mn9s[j]` is set to the maximum possible value `mn` for each iteration, `mxZString` is as before, `v` is as before.**
