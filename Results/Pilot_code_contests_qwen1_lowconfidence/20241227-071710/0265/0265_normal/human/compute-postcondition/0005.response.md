According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 9. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `i` and how it changes within each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105.
- `pair9s` is a dictionary where the key is an integer and the value is `9 - i` for those keys, and `pair9s[i]` is set to `9 - i`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `i` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- Since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to 9, if `i` was previously 9, the loop will not execute again because `range(10)` only includes numbers from 0 to 9 (inclusive).

Given that we are at the end of the previous iteration and assuming the previous value of `i` was less than 9, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Let's assume the previous value of `i` was `k` (where `k < 9`). Then, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `pair9s[i]` will be set to `9 - (k + 1) = 8 - k`.

Since the `digits` string and the `pair9s` dictionary do not change within the loop body, they remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `digits` remains the same.
- `pair9s` remains the same.

State: **`digits` is a string representing a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105; `pair9s` is a dictionary with keys being integers and values being `9 - i` for those keys, and additionally `pair9s[i]` is set to `9 - i`**.
