Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer.
   - `digit` is the second character of `digits`.
   - `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys.
   - `baseCounts` is a list of 10 zeros where the element at index `int(digit)` is incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for digit in digits:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `digits`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `digit` was set to the second character of `digits`.

4. **Determine the Next Character:**
   - Since `digit` is the second character of `digits`, the next character to process will be the third character of `digits`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `digits` remains the same as it is a string, and we just move to the next character.
   - `digit` needs to be set to the third character of `digits`.
   - `pair9s` remains unchanged.
   - `baseCounts` remains unchanged because the increment operation only happens when `digit` is processed, and since we're moving to the next character, no changes are made to `baseCounts` yet.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `digits` remains the same.
   - `digit` is now the third character of `digits`.
   - `pair9s` is unchanged.
   - `baseCounts` is unchanged.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the third character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 zeros.**
