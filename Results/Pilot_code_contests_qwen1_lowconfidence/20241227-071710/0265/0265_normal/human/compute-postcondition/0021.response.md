The variable `zeros` is assigned the value 0. This initializes `zeros` to 0 without affecting the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer; `digit` is the last character of `digits`; `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys; `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`; `iTen` is 1; `mxZeros` is 0; `countsa` is a copy of `baseCounts`; `countsb` is a copy of `baseCounts`; `zeros` is 0.**
