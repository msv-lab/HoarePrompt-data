In the given code snippet, `countsa = baseCounts[:]` is used to create a shallow copy of the list `baseCounts` and assign it to the variable `countsa`. This means that `countsa` will now hold the same values as `baseCounts`, but they will be separate lists in memory.

Here are the steps to determine the state after executing this line of code:

1. **Previous State**: 
   - `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers.
   - `countsa` is initialized and holds the same values as `baseCounts`.

2. **Effect of the Code**:
   - The code `countsa = baseCounts[:]` creates a shallow copy of `baseCounts` and assigns it to `countsa`.
   - This means that both `countsa` and `baseCounts` now contain the same values, but they are two separate lists.

3. **Updated State**:
   - `baseCounts` remains unchanged.
   - `countsa` now contains the same values as `baseCounts`.

Given the initial state where `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers, the updated state will be:

Output State: **`baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers, `countsa` is a list of 10 integers containing the same values as `baseCounts`**.
