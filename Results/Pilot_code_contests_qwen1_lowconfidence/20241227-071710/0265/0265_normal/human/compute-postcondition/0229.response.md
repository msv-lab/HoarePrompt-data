Postcondition: **`digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the last character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are 9 - i for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index i (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit i in `digits`, `iTen` is 4, `mxZeros` is the maximum number of zeros accumulated during the loop executions, `countsa` and `countsb` are shallow copies of `baseCounts` and are used for temporary calculations, `zeros` is the total number of zeros accumulated during the loop executions, `i10` is 6, `mn9s` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index j is the maximum value of `mn` found during the loop for that j, `mni10` is the minimum value of `1` and `min(countsa[i], countsb[i10])`, `mxZString[0]` is a string representing the optimal arrangement of digits based on the maximum number of zeros, `mxZString[1]` is a string representing the mirrored arrangement of digits, `v` is 2 unless `mxZeros` is updated.**
