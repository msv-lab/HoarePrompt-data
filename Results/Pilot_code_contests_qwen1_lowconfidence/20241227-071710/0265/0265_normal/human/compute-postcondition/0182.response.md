`zeros` is incremented by `mn`. The value of `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[1]` and `countsb[pair9s[1]]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 1; `j9` is `pair9s[1]`; `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[1]` and `countsb[pair9s[1]]`; `countsa[1]` is `countsa[1] - mn`; `countsb[j9]` is `countsb[j9] - mn`; `zeros` is `zeros + mn`.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `j9` is `pair9s[1]`; `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[1]` and `countsb[pair9s[1]]`; `countsa[1]` is `countsa[1] - mn`; `countsb[j9]` is `countsb[j9] - mn`; `zeros` is `zeros + mn`**
