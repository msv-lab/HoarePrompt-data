Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i10` is within the range [0, 9].
   - `zeros` is non-negative.
   - `mn` is a valid value (≥ 0).
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `mxZString[0]` is the current value of `mxZString[0]` concatenated with `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times.
   - `mxZString[1]` is `"9"` repeated `mn` times plus `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop is defined as `for j in range(10):`. This means `j` will iterate from 0 to 9 inclusive.

3. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than 10.
   - Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i10`, `zeros`, `mn`, and `mxZString[0]`, `mxZString[1]` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop variable `j`.
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i10` remains within the range [0, 9].
- `zeros` remains non-negative.
- `mn` remains a valid value (≥ 0).
- `j` becomes 2.
- `mxZString[0]` remains the same.
- `mxZString[1]` remains the same.

**State: **`i10` is within [0, 9], `zeros` is non-negative, `mn` is a valid value (≥ 0), `j` is 2, `mxZString[0]` is the current value of `mxZString[0]` concatenated with `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, `mxZString[1]` is `"9"` repeated `mn` times plus `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times**.
