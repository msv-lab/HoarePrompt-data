The code prints a dictionary with keys `v` and `mxZString`. Let's analyze the changes:

- `v` is set to 2.
- `mxZString` is printed, but its content does not change as a result of this print statement.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 10.
- `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and additionally `str(i) * mni10` and `'0' * mn0` are appended.
- `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"0"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and `str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0` is appended.

After the print statement, the values of `j`, `mxZString[0]`, `mxZString[1]`, `i`, `i10`, `mn9s`, `mni10`, and `mn0` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 10, `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"9"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and additionally `str(i) * mni10` and `'0' * mn0` are appended; `mxZString[1]` is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, `"8"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times, ..., `"0"` repeated `mn9s[9]` times, and `str(i10) * mni10 + '0' * mn0` is appended; `v` is 2**
