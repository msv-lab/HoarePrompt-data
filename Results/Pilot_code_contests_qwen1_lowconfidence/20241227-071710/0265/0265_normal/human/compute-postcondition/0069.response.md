The given code snippet appends `str(j) * countsb[j]` to `mxZString[1]` for `j` ranging from 1 to 9. Since `j` is 10, this loop does not execute any iterations and the value of `mxZString[1]` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the only change is the addition to `mxZString[1]` from the previous state. The output state will include the updated `mxZString[1]` as described.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the last character of `digits`, `pairs` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`, `iTen` is 9, `mxZeros` is equal to `zeros`, `countsa` is a list of 10 integers where the first element is `baseCounts[0] - zeros/2 - 1`, and each subsequent element is derived from `baseCounts[i]` adjusted for `countsa`, `countsb` is a list of 10 integers where the first element is `0`, and each subsequent element is derived from `baseCounts[i]` adjusted for `countsb`, `zeros` is the original value of `zeros` plus `baseCounts[0] - zeros/2 - 1`, `i10` is 9, `mn9s` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `j` is the maximum `mn` value for that `j` found during the loop, `mni10` is 9, `print output` is `{i: 1, countsa: baseCounts.copy() - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -zeros/2], countsb: baseCounts.copy() - [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -zeros/2 - 1]}, mxZeros: zeros, mni10: 9, mn0: baseCounts[0] - zeros/2 - 1}`, `mxZString[0]` is updated to include `'0' * (baseCounts[0] - zeros/2 - 1)` followed by `str(j) * baseCounts[j]` for each `j` from 1 to 9, and `mxZString[1]` is the original value of `mxZString[1]` followed by `str(j) * countsb[j]` for each `j` from 1 to 9.**
