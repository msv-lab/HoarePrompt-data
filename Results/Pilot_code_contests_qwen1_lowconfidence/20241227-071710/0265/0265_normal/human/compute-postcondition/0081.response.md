`mxZString[0]` is updated by appending `str(j)` repeated `mn9s[j]` times to the current value of `mxZString[0]`. Since `j` is initially 1, `str(j)` is "1". However, the exact value of `mn9s[j]` is not provided in the initial state, so we'll keep it as `mn9s[j]`.

The initial state provides that `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times. After the operation, this will be updated to include `"1"` repeated `mn9s[j]` times.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times

After the code is executed, the new value of `mxZString[0]` will be its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times, plus `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `mxZString[0]` is its original value plus `"0"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times and `"1"` repeated `mn9s[1]` times; `mxZString`[1] is its original value plus `"9"` repeated `mn9s[0]` times**
