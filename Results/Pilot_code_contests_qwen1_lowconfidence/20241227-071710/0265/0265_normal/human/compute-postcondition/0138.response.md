The code snippet modifies `mxZString[1]` by appending `str(j) * countsb[j]` to it. Let's break this down:

- Initially, `j` is 1.
- `mxZString[1]` starts with its initial value followed by "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times.

Given this, the modification to `mxZString[1]` will append `str(j)` (which is "1") multiplied by `countsb[j]` (where `j` is 1) to the end of `mxZString[1]`.

Since `j` is 1, `str(j) * countsb[j]` simplifies to `"1" * countsb[1]`, which means it appends "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times to `mxZString[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 1; `mxZString[0]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsa[1]` times; `mxZString[1]` is its initial value concatenated with "0" repeated `countsa[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times and then "1" repeated `countsb[1]` times appended to it.**
