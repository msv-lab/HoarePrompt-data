Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `digit` is the last character of `digits`, `pair9s` is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to 9 and the values are `9 - i` for those keys, `baseCounts` is a list of 10 integers where each element at index `i` (0 to 9) represents the count of the digit `i` in `digits`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `digits`.
- For each character `digit` in `digits`, the corresponding element in `baseCounts` at index `int(digit)` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop finishes executing, `baseCounts` will contain the count of each digit (from 0 to 9) present in the string `digits`.
- The loop will execute at least once if `digits` is a non-empty string. If `digits` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `baseCounts` will remain as a list of 10 zeros.
