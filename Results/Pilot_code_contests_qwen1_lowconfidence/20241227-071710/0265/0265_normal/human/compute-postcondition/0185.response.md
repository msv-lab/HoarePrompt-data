Let's break down the given information and think through the states step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `j9` is `pair9s[1]`
   - `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[1]` and `countsb[pair9s[1]]`
   - `countsa[1]` is reduced by `mn`
   - `countsb[j9]` is reduced by `mn`
   - `zeros` is increased by `mn`
   - `mn9s[1]` is set to `mn`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(10):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - The loop will increment `j` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - Given that `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - Since `j` is now 2, we need to determine how the other states might change or remain the same based on the current loop iteration.
   - `j9` will be `pair9s[2]` because it is derived from `j`.
   - `mn` will be recalculated as the minimum value between `countsa[2]` and `countsb[pair9s[2]]`.
   - `countsa[2]` will be reduced by `mn`.
   - `countsb[j9]` will be reduced by `mn` (where `j9` is `pair9s[2]`).
   - `zeros` will be increased by `mn`.
   - `mn9s[2]` will be set to `mn`.

Therefore, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`j` is 2, `j9` is `pair9s[2]`, `mn` is the minimum value between `countsa[2]` and `countsb[pair9s[2]]`, `countsa[2]` is reduced by `mn`, `countsb[j9]` is reduced by `mn`, `zeros` is increased by `mn`, `mn9s[2]` is set to `mn`**
