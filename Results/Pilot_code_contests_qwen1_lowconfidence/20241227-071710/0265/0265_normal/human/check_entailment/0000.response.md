Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the number `n` has more than one zero digit. The logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that the permutations result in the maximum number of trailing zeros when summed. 

For example, consider the input `100`. The expected output should be permutations like `100` and `001` or `010`, etc., which would sum to `101` and end with one zero. However, the current implementation might not produce such permutations due to its logic for handling zero digits. This can be verified by manually checking the logic or by providing the specific test case `100` to see that the program does not generate the correct permutations.
