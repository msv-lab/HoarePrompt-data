Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the code does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves leading zeros in the permutations. The function `func_1` constructs the permutations but does not ensure that leading zeros are correctly placed in the resulting strings. 

For example, consider the input `100`. The expected output is:

```
001
001
```

However, the current implementation does not produce this output because it does not explicitly account for leading zeros in the permutations. The code constructs the permutations but does not guarantee that the permutations will have leading zeros if necessary.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that if leading zeros are required to maximize the number of trailing zeros in the sum, they are included in the permutations. This requires additional logic to handle such cases properly.
