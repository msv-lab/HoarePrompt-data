You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrey's favourite number is n. Andrey's friends gave him two identical numbers n as a New Year present. He hung them on a wall and watched them adoringly.

Then Andrey got bored from looking at the same number and he started to swap digits first in one, then in the other number, then again in the first number and so on (arbitrary number of changes could be made in each number). At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.

Given number n, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n â€” the original number. The number of digits in this number does not exceed 105. The number is written without any leading zeroes.

Output

Print two permutations of digits of number n, such that the sum of these numbers ends with the maximum number of zeroes. The permutations can have leading zeroes (if they are present, they all should be printed). The permutations do not have to be different. If there are several answers, print any of them.

```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `digits` which is a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105. It then performs several operations to find the optimal arrangement of digits and their mirrored counterpart such that the number of zeros in these arrangements is maximized. Specifically, the function calculates the frequency of each digit in `digits` and iteratively tries to form pairs of digits that result in zeros when combined. 

After processing, the function checks if the maximum number of zeros (`mxZeros`) achieved during the iterations is zero. If so, it returns the original `digits` as a tuple of two identical strings. Otherwise, it constructs and returns a tuple containing two strings: `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]`, which represent the optimal and mirrored arrangements of digits, respectively.

The function handles the case where no zeros can be formed by returning the original `digits` as a tuple. This ensures that even if the input does not allow for any zeros to be formed, the function still provides a meaningful output.

Edge cases to consider include:
- If `digits` consists entirely of the same digit, the function will still return the same `digits` as a tuple.
- If the maximum number of zeros achievable is zero, the function correctly returns the original `digits`.

Potential missing functionality to note:
- The function prints intermediate results during its execution, which is not part of the final output and does not affect the postconditions. However, these prints might be useful for debugging or understanding the intermediate steps.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
