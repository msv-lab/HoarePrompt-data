You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Andrey's favourite number is n. Andrey's friends gave him two identical numbers n as a New Year present. He hung them on a wall and watched them adoringly.

Then Andrey got bored from looking at the same number and he started to swap digits first in one, then in the other number, then again in the first number and so on (arbitrary number of changes could be made in each number). At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.

Given number n, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n â€” the original number. The number of digits in this number does not exceed 105. The number is written without any leading zeroes.

Output

Print two permutations of digits of number n, such that the sum of these numbers ends with the maximum number of zeroes. The permutations can have leading zeroes (if they are present, they all should be printed). The permutations do not have to be different. If there are several answers, print any of them.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `digits` which is a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105. It then performs several operations to find the optimal arrangement of digits and their mirrored counterpart such that the number of zeros in these arrangements is maximized. Specifically, the function calculates the frequency of each digit in `digits` and iteratively tries to form pairs of digits that result in zeros when combined. 

After processing, the function checks if the maximum number of zeros (`mxZeros`) achieved during the iterations is zero. If so, it returns the original `digits` as a tuple of two identical strings. Otherwise, it constructs and returns a tuple containing two strings: `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]`, which represent the optimal and mirrored arrangements of digits, respectively.

The function handles the case where no zeros can be formed by returning the original `digits` as a tuple. This ensures that even if the input does not allow for any zeros to be formed, the function still provides a meaningful output.

Edge cases to consider include:
- If `digits` consists entirely of the same digit, the function will still return the same `digits` as a tuple.
- If the maximum number of zeros achievable is zero, the function correctly returns the original `digits`.

Potential missing functionality to note:
- The function prints intermediate results during its execution, which is not part of the final output and does not affect the postconditions. However, these prints might be useful for debugging or understanding the intermediate steps.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
