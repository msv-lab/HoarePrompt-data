Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, particularly when the number `n` contains multiple zeros. According to the annotations, the logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that the permutations result in the maximum number of trailing zeros when summed. For example, for the input `100`, the expected output should include permutations like `100` and `001` or `010`, etc., which would sum to `101` and end with one zero. However, the current implementation might not produce such permutations due to its logic for handling zero digits. The annotations support this by indicating that the program does not account for all possible ways to maximize trailing zeros, especially in cases with multiple zeros. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
