Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` aims to find two digit permutations such that their sum ends with the maximum number of zeros. However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The function constructs strings with leading zeros, which is allowed according to the problem statement. However, the logic for forming these permutations is flawed.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Zeros**: The function iterates over possible pairs of digits (i, 10-i) to maximize the number of trailing zeros in the sum. However, it incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of zeros is achieved by simply pairing digits and their complements to 9. This approach is not always optimal, especially when considering the distribution of digits in the input number.

3. **Missing Consideration of Distributions**: The function does not fully consider the distribution of digits in the input number. For example, if the input number has multiple '5's and '5's complement (which is '5'), the function might not achieve the maximum number of zeros because it does not explore all possible permutations.

4. **Infinite Loop Potential**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the hints, the function could potentially enter an infinite loop if the input number has a specific distribution of digits that causes the loop conditions to never terminate correctly.

To illustrate, consider the input `555`. The correct solution would be to pair '5' with '5' to maximize the number of trailing zeros. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case and might not produce the optimal solution.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, hence the Correctness is **False**.
