You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrey's favourite number is n. Andrey's friends gave him two identical numbers n as a New Year present. He hung them on a wall and watched them adoringly.

Then Andrey got bored from looking at the same number and he started to swap digits first in one, then in the other number, then again in the first number and so on (arbitrary number of changes could be made in each number). At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.

Given number n, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n â€” the original number. The number of digits in this number does not exceed 105. The number is written without any leading zeroes.

Output

Print two permutations of digits of number n, such that the sum of these numbers ends with the maximum number of zeroes. The permutations can have leading zeroes (if they are present, they all should be printed). The permutations do not have to be different. If there are several answers, print any of them.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the number `n` has more than one zero digit. The logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that the permutations result in the maximum number of trailing zeros when summed. 

For example, consider the input `100`. The expected output should be permutations like `100` and `001` or `010`, etc., which would sum to `101` and end with one zero. However, the current implementation might not produce such permutations due to its logic for handling zero digits. This can be verified by manually checking the logic or by providing the specific test case `100` to see that the program does not generate the correct permutations.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `digits` which is a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105. It then performs several operations to find the optimal arrangement of digits and their mirrored counterpart such that the number of zeros in these arrangements is maximized. Specifically, the function calculates the frequency of each digit in `digits` and iteratively tries to form pairs of digits that result in zeros when combined. 

After processing, the function checks if the maximum number of zeros (`mxZeros`) achieved during the iterations is zero. If so, it returns the original `digits` as a tuple of two identical strings. Otherwise, it constructs and returns a tuple containing two strings: `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]`, which represent the optimal and mirrored arrangements of digits, respectively.

The function handles the case where no zeros can be formed by returning the original `digits` as a tuple. This ensures that even if the input does not allow for any zeros to be formed, the function still provides a meaningful output.

Edge cases to consider include:
- If `digits` consists entirely of the same digit, the function will still return the same `digits` as a tuple.
- If the maximum number of zeros achievable is zero, the function correctly returns the original `digits`.

Potential missing functionality to note:
- The function prints intermediate results during its execution, which is not part of the final output and does not affect the postconditions. However, these prints might be useful for debugging or understanding the intermediate steps.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
