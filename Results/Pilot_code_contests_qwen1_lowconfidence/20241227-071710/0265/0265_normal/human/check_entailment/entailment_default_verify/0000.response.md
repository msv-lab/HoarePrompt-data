Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle cases where the number `n` has more than one zero digit. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that the permutations result in the maximum number of trailing zeros when summed, particularly in cases where the number contains multiple zeros. For example, for the input `100`, the expected output should involve permutations like `100` and `001` or similar, which would sum to `101` and end with one zero. However, the current implementation might not produce such permutations due to its handling of zero digits. The output hints confirm this issue by noting that the function does not correctly form the permutations to maximize the number of trailing zeros. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and should be maintained.
