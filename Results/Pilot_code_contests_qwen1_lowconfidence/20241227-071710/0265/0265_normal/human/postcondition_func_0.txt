The function `func_1` accepts a string `digits` which is a positive integer without leading zeroes and with a length not exceeding 105. It then performs several operations to find the optimal arrangement of digits and their mirrored counterpart such that the number of zeros in these arrangements is maximized. Specifically, the function calculates the frequency of each digit in `digits` and iteratively tries to form pairs of digits that result in zeros when combined. 

After processing, the function checks if the maximum number of zeros (`mxZeros`) achieved during the iterations is zero. If so, it returns the original `digits` as a tuple of two identical strings. Otherwise, it constructs and returns a tuple containing two strings: `mxZString[0]` and `mxZString[1]`, which represent the optimal and mirrored arrangements of digits, respectively.

The function handles the case where no zeros can be formed by returning the original `digits` as a tuple. This ensures that even if the input does not allow for any zeros to be formed, the function still provides a meaningful output.

Edge cases to consider include:
- If `digits` consists entirely of the same digit, the function will still return the same `digits` as a tuple.
- If the maximum number of zeros achievable is zero, the function correctly returns the original `digits`.

Potential missing functionality to note:
- The function prints intermediate results during its execution, which is not part of the final output and does not affect the postconditions. However, these prints might be useful for debugging or understanding the intermediate steps.
