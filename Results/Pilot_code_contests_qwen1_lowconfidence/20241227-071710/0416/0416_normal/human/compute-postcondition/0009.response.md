`change_red` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0. The value of `change_black` remains unchanged, `line` must still have at least one character, `idx` is still 1, and `val` is still 'r'. Therefore, the Output State is: `change_red` is 1, `change_black` is 1 if `idx` is even and `val` is 'b', `line` must have at least one character, `idx` is 1, and `val` is 'r'.

Output State: **`change_red` is 1, `change_black` is 1 if `idx` is even and `val` is 'b', `line` must have at least one character, `idx` is 1, and `val` is 'r'**
