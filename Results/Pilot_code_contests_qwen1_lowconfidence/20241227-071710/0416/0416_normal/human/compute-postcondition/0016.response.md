Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `change_red` is 0 or 1
   - `change_black` is 2
   - `idx` is 1

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `line` using `enumerate`.
   - The condition for updating `change_red` is: `if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'`, then `change_red` is updated to 1.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `idx` is 1, `idx % 2 == 1` is true.
   - Therefore, if `val == 'r'`, `change_red` would be updated to 1.

4. **Assuming the Value of `val`:**
   - We need to consider both possibilities: `val` could be either 'r' or something else.
   - If `val` is 'r', `change_red` will be updated to 1.
   - If `val` is not 'r', `change_red` remains unchanged.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - `idx` will be incremented by 1, so `idx` becomes 2.
   - For the next iteration, `idx % 2 == 1` will be false.

6. **Final States:**
   - `change_red` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `val`.
   - `change_black` remains 2.
   - `idx` becomes 2.

Given these steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `change_red` will be either 0 or 1.
- `change_black` remains 2.
- `idx` becomes 2.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`change_red` is 0 or 1, `change_black` is 2, `idx` is 2**.
