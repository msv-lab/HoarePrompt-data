Postcondition: **`line` must have at least one character, `idx` is 1 (since idx % 2 == 1), `val` is the second character of `line`, `change_red` is 0, `change_black` is 0, `change_red2` is 0, `change_black2` is 0, `swaps` is 0, `color` is 0, and `total` is 0. Additionally, the condition is met when `val` is 'b'.**
