Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop involves `idx` (the index) and `val` (the value at the index), both of which are determined by the `enumerate` function applied to the `line` string.

2. **Determine Initial Values for `idx` and `val`**:
   - When `enumerate(line)` is called, it generates pairs `(idx, val)` where `idx` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`, and `val` is each character in the string `line`.
   - For the loop to start executing, there must be at least one character in `line`.

3. **Initial Values of Given Variables**:
   - `change_red` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.
   - `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r'.
   - `change_black` is 0.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `line` is a string of length `n`, for the loop to start, `line` must have at least one character. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The initial values for `idx` and `val` are as follows:
     - `idx` starts at 0.
     - `val` is the first character in `line`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `change_red` is 0.
   - `change_black` is 0.
   - `line` must have at least one character, i.e., `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `val` is the first character in `line`.

Based on this analysis, the required states to adjust for the loop to execute are:

State: **`change_red` is 0, `change_black` is 0, `line` must have at least one character (i.e., `n` is greater than or equal to 1), `idx` is 0, `val` is the first character in `line`**.
