Postcondition: ***`idx` is `current_idx + 1`, `val` is the next element in `line`, `change_red` remains unchanged, `change_red2` is either unchanged or increased by 1 depending on whether `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'r'`, `swaps` remains unchanged, `color` remains unchanged, `total` remains unchanged. If `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'r'`, then `change_red2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `change_red2` remains unchanged.***
