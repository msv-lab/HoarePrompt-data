The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but takes input from the user. The first line of input is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), representing the number of cockroaches. The second line is a string of length `n`, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', where 'b' denotes a black cockroach and 'r' denotes a red cockroach. Based on this input, the function processes the string and returns either a count of black cockroaches or a count of red cockroaches.

Given the output cases are not specified directly, we infer the function returns a count of either black ('b') or red ('r') cockroaches. However, without further specification on which count to return, we'll describe the function as accepting the described input and returning a count of either type of cockroach.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', representing the number and types of cockroaches respectively, and returns the count of either black ('b') or red ('r') cockroaches.**
