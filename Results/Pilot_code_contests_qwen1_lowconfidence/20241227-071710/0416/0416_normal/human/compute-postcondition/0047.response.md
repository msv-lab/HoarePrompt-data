Output State: **`idx` is `len(line) - 1`, `val` is the last character in `line`, `change_red` is the number of times `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'` was true, `change_red2` is the count of times an index `idx` that is even and the value is 'r' appeared in the string `line`, `swaps` is equal to `min(change_red, change_black)`, `color` is `max(change_red, change_black) - min(change_red, change_black)`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_black` is the number of times `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b'` was true, `change_black2` is the count of times an index `idx` that is odd and the value is 'b' appeared in the string `line`, `swaps2` is `min(change_red2, change_black2)`, `color2` is `max(change_red2, change_black2) - swaps2`, and `total2` is `swaps2 + color2`.**
