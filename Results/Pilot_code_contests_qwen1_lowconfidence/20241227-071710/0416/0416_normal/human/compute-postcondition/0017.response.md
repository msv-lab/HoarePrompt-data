`change_black` is incremented by 1. Since `change_black` was initially 2, after the increment, `change_black` will be 3. The values of `change_red` and `idx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `change_red` is 0 or 1, `change_black` is 3, `idx` is 2.

Output State: **`change_red` is 0 or 1, `change_black` is 3, `idx` is 2**
