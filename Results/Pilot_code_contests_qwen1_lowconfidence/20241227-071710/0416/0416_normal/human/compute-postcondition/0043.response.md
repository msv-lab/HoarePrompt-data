Postcondition: ***`idx` is `current_idx + 2`, `val` is the next element in `line`, `change_red` remains unchanged, `change_red2` is incremented by 1 (only if `idx % 2 == 0` and `val == 'r'`), `swaps` remains unchanged, `color` remains unchanged, `total` remains unchanged, and `change_black2` remains unchanged.***
