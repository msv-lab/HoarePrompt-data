Postcondition: **`idx` is `current_idx + 2`, `val` is the next element in `line`, `change_red` remains unchanged, `change_red2` remains unchanged if `idx % 2 != 0` or `val != 'r'`, or increases by 1 if `idx % 2 == 0` and `val == 'r'`, `swaps` remains unchanged, `color` remains unchanged, `total` remains unchanged, and `change_black2` is increased by 1 if `idx % 2 == 1` and `val == 'b'. Otherwise, `change_black2` remains unchanged.**
