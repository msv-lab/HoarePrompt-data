`swaps` is assigned the value of `min(change_red, change_black)`, which is the minimum between the number of times the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'` was true (`change_red`) and the number of times the condition `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b'` was true (`change_black`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`change_red` is the number of times the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'` was true, `change_black` is the number of times the condition `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b'` was true, `line` is the original string of length `n` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', `idx` is the last index processed by the loop, and `swaps` is equal to `min(change_red, change_black)`**.
