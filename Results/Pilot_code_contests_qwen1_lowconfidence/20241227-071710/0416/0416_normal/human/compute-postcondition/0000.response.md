The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `raw_input()` waits for user input and returns it as a string, which is then converted to an integer using `int()`. This affects the value of `n` but does not affect the initial state of the string that follows in the next line.

Output State: **The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) representing the number of cockroaches. The second line contains a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', where 'b' denotes a black cockroach and 'r' denotes a red cockroach.; `n` is the integer input as an integer.**
