`change_black` is incremented by 1. The value of `change_red` remains 0, the length of `line` is unchanged, `idx` is still 0, and `val` is still 'b'. Therefore, the Output State is: `change_red` is 0; `change_black` is 1; `line` must have at least one character; `idx` is 0; `val` is 'b'; the current value of `idx` is even.

Output State: **`change_red` is 0; `change_black` is 1; `line` must have at least one character; `idx` is 0; `val` is 'b'; the current value of `idx` is even.**
