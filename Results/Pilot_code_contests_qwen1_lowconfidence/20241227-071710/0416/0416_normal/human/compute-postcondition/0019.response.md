The code `change_red += 1` increments the value of `change_red` by 1. Given the initial state where `change_red` is either 0 or 1, `change_black` is 3, and `idx` is 2, we need to determine the new value of `change_red`.

Since `idx` is 2, which is even, and the condition `val == 'b'` is not mentioned in the initial state, the condition `if idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b'` does not apply, and thus `change_black` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the value of `change_red` is incremented from its initial value of 0 or 1 to 1 or 2, respectively.

Output State: **`change_red` is 1 or 2, `change_black` is 3, and `idx` is 2.**
