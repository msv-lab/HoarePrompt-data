`change_black` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `2`. The value of `change_red`, `line`, `idx`, and `val` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `change_red` is 0 or 1 depending on the second character in `line`, `change_black` is 2, `line` must have at least one character, `idx` is 1, and `val` is the second character in `line`.

Output State: **`change_red` is 0 or 1 depending on the second character in `line`, `change_black` is 2, `line` must have at least one character, `idx` is 1, and `val` is the second character in `line`**
