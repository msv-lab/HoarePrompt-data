Postcondition: ***`change_red` is 0, `change_black` is 1 if `idx` is even and `val` is 'b', `line` must have at least one character, `idx` is 0, and `val` is the first character in `line`. If `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'` is true, `change_red` becomes 1. If the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'` is false, the values of `change_red`, `change_black`, `line`, `idx`, and `val` remain unchanged.***
