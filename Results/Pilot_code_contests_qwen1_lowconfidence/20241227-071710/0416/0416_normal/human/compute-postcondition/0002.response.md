The code assigns 0 to the variable `change_red`. The variable `n` and the string `line` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `change_red` and retains the preconditions for `n` and `line`.

Output State: **`change_red` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, `line` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r'**
