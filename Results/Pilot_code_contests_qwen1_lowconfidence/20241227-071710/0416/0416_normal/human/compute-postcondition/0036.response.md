Postcondition: ***`idx` is `current_idx + 1`, `val` is the next element in `line`, `change_red` remains unchanged, `change_red2` remains unchanged, `swaps` remains unchanged, `color` remains unchanged, `total` remains unchanged. If `idx % 2 == 1` and `val == 'b'`, then `change_black2` is `current_idx + 2`. Otherwise, `change_black2` remains unchanged.***
