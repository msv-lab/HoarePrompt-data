`change_red2` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `idx` is even, `val` is 'r', and no other variables are affected, the updated value of `change_red2` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is even, `val` is 'r', `change_black2` remains 0, `change_red` remains unchanged, `change_red2` is 1, `swaps` remains unchanged, `color` remains unchanged, and `total` remains unchanged.**
