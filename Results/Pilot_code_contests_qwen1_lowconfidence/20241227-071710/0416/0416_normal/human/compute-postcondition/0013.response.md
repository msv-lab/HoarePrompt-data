Postcondition: ***`change_red` is 0 or 1 depending on the second character in `line`, `change_black` is 2, `line` must have at least one character, `idx` is 1, and `val` is the second character in `line`. If `idx % 2 == 0` and `val == 'b'`, then `change_black` is updated to 2. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
