`change_red2` is incremented by 1 because the condition `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'r'` is not specified in the initial state and the code only increments `change_red2` unconditionally. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`idx` is `current_idx + 2`, `val` is the next element in `line`, `change_red` remains unchanged, `change_red2` is incremented by 1, `swaps` remains unchanged, `color` remains unchanged, `total` remains unchanged, and `change_black2` remains unchanged.**
