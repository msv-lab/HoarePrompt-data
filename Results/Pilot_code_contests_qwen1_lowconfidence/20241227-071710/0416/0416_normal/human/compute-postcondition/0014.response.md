`change_red` is incremented by 1. The value of `change_black` remains unchanged unless the conditions specified are met. Since the code only increments `change_red` by 1, the value of `change_black` stays at 2. The states of the other variables (`line`, `idx`, and `val`) are not affected.

Output State: **`change_red` is 1, `change_black` is 2**
