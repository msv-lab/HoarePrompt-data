You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anatoly lives in the university dorm as many other students do. As you know, cockroaches are also living there together with students. Cockroaches might be of two colors: black and red. There are n cockroaches living in Anatoly's room.

Anatoly just made all his cockroaches to form a single line. As he is a perfectionist, he would like the colors of cockroaches in the line to alternate. He has a can of black paint and a can of red paint. In one turn he can either swap any two cockroaches, or take any single cockroach and change it's color.

Help Anatoly find out the minimum number of turns he needs to make the colors of cockroaches in the line alternate.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of cockroaches.

The second line contains a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r' that denote black cockroach and red cockroach respectively.

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of moves Anatoly has to perform in order to make the colors of cockroaches in the line to alternate.

Examples

Input

5
rbbrr


Output

Input

bbbbb


Output

2


Input

3
rbr


Output

0

Note

In the first sample, Anatoly has to swap third and fourth cockroaches. He needs 1 turn to do this.

In the second sample, the optimum answer is to paint the second and the fourth cockroaches red. This requires 2 turns.

In the third sample, the colors of cockroaches in the line are alternating already, thus the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    line = raw_input()
    change_red = 0
    change_black = 0
    for (idx, val) in enumerate(line):
        if idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b':
            change_black += 1
        if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r':
            change_red += 1
    swaps = min(change_red, change_black)
    color = max(change_red, change_black) - swaps
    total = swaps + color
    change_red2 = 0
    change_black2 = 0
    for (idx, val) in enumerate(line):
        if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'b':
            change_black2 += 1
        if idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'r':
            change_red2 += 1
    swaps2 = min(change_red2, change_black2)
    color2 = max(change_red2, change_black2) - swaps2
    total2 = swaps2 + color2
    print(min(total, total2))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to make the colors of cockroaches alternate. It considers both possible alternating patterns ('rbrbrb...' and 'brbrbr...') and determines the minimum number of changes needed for each pattern. By comparing the results of both patterns, it outputs the smallest number of moves required. Given the examples provided and the logical structure of the code, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) representing the number of cockroaches. The second line contains a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', where 'b' denotes a black cockroach and 'r' denotes a red cockroach.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    line = raw_input()
    change_red = 0
    change_black = 0
    for (idx, val) in enumerate(line):
        if idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b':
            change_black += 1
        
        if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r':
            change_red += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `change_red` is the number of times the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'` was true, `change_black` is the number of times the condition `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b'` was true, `line` is the original string of length `n` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', and `idx` is the last index processed by the loop.
    swaps = min(change_red, change_black)
    color = max(change_red, change_black) - swaps
    total = swaps + color
    change_red2 = 0
    change_black2 = 0
    for (idx, val) in enumerate(line):
        if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'b':
            change_black2 += 1
        
        if idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'r':
            change_red2 += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `idx` is `len(line) - 1`, `val` is the last character in `line`, `change_red` is the number of times `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'` was true, `change_red2` is the count of times an index `idx` that is even and the value is 'r' appeared in the string `line`, `swaps` is equal to `min(change_red, change_black)`, `color` is `max(change_red, change_black) - min(change_red, change_black)`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_black` is the number of times `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b'` was true, and `change_black2` is the count of times an index `idx` that is odd and the value is 'b' appeared in the string `line`.
    swaps2 = min(change_red2, change_black2)
    color2 = max(change_red2, change_black2) - swaps2
    total2 = swaps2 + color2
    print(min(total, total2))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
