#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) representing the number of cockroaches. The second line contains a string of length n, consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', where 'b' denotes a black cockroach and 'r' denotes a red cockroach.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    line = raw_input()

        if idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r':
            change_red += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `change_red` is the number of times the condition `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'` was true, `change_black` is the number of times the condition `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b'` was true, `line` is the original string of length `n` consisting of characters 'b' and 'r', and `idx` is the last index processed by the loop.
    swaps = min(change_red, change_black)
    color = max(change_red, change_black) - swaps

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `idx` is `len(line) - 1`, `val` is the last character in `line`, `change_red` is the number of times `idx % 2 == 1 and val == 'r'` was true, `change_red2` is the count of times an index `idx` that is even and the value is 'r' appeared in the string `line`, `swaps` is equal to `min(change_red, change_black)`, `color` is `max(change_red, change_black) - min(change_red, change_black)`, `total` is `swaps + color`, `change_black` is the number of times `idx % 2 == 0 and val == 'b'` was true, and `change_black2` is the count of times an index `idx` that is odd and the value is 'b' appeared in the string `line`.
    swaps2 = min(change_red2, change_black2)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string of length `n` containing 'b' and 'r' characters, which represent black and red cockroaches respectively. It counts the number of swaps needed to arrange the cockroaches such that all 'b's appear in one half of the string and all 'r's in the other half, while minimizing the number of swaps. The function calculates two possible arrangements and prints the minimum number of swaps required for either arrangement. The function handles edge cases such as when the string is empty or contains only one type of cockroach.
