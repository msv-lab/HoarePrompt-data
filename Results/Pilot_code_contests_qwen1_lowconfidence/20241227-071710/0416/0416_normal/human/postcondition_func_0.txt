The function processes a string of length `n` containing 'b' and 'r' characters, which represent black and red cockroaches respectively. It counts the number of swaps needed to arrange the cockroaches such that all 'b's appear in one half of the string and all 'r's in the other half, while minimizing the number of swaps. The function calculates two possible arrangements and prints the minimum number of swaps required for either arrangement. The function handles edge cases such as when the string is empty or contains only one type of cockroach.
