You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya loves long lucky numbers very much. He is interested in the minimum lucky number d that meets some condition. Let cnt(x) be the number of occurrences of number x in number d as a substring. For example, if d = 747747, then cnt(4) = 2, cnt(7) = 4, cnt(47) = 2, cnt(74) = 2. Petya wants the following condition to fulfil simultaneously: cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. Petya is not interested in the occurrences of other numbers. Help him cope with this task.

Input

The single line contains four integers a1, a2, a3 and a4 (1 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 106).

Output

On the single line print without leading zeroes the answer to the problem — the minimum lucky number d such, that cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. If such number does not exist, print the single number "-1" (without the quotes).

                (tem, four, seven) = (tem2, four2, seven2)
            (ext4, ext7) = ('4' * (a[0] - four), '7' * (a[1] - seven))

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it constructs the lucky number. Specifically, it does not ensure that the counts of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` are correctly maintained. 

For example, consider the input `a1 = 4`, `a2 = 3`, `a3 = 2`, `a4 = 1`. According to the problem description, we need to construct the smallest lucky number where there are 4 occurrences of '4', 3 occurrences of '7', 2 occurrences of '47', and 1 occurrence of '74'. 

However, the program constructs the number in a way that does not guarantee these counts. It alternates between appending '4' and '7' to two separate lists (`tem` and `tem2`) and then tries to append extra '4's and '7's to meet the required counts. This approach does not necessarily ensure that the counts of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` will be exactly as specified.

To illustrate, let's consider the construction process:

1. For the first two characters, it appends '4' and '7' to both lists, ensuring `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` are incremented.
2. For subsequent characters, it alternates between '4' and '7' but does not maintain the exact count of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` as required.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly handle the counts for `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)`, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a1, a2, a3, and a4 are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    a = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    if (abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        tem, tem2 = ['4'], ['7']
        four, seven = 1, 0
        four2, seven2 = 0, 1
        for i in range(a[2] + a[3]):
            if i & 1:
                tem.append('4')
                tem2.append('7')
                four += 1
                seven2 += 1
            else:
                tem.append('7')
                tem2.append('4')

                seven += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`. If `i & 1` is true, then `tem` will contain alternating '4' and '7' starting with '4' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, and `tem2` will contain alternating '7' and '4' starting with '7' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`. The counts `four` and `seven2` will each be incremented by the number of odd indices (i.e., `a3 + a4 // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `a3 + a4 // 2`). The counts `four2` and `seven` will each be incremented by the number of even indices (i.e., `(a3 + a4 + 1) // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `(a3 + a4) // 2`). If `i & 1` is false, the same logic applies but starting with '7' and '4' respectively. If the loop does not execute (`a3 + a4 <= 0`), `i` remains 0, `tem` is `['4']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 1, `seven2` is 1, `four2` is 0, and `seven` is 0.
        if ((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1])) :

            ext4, ext7 = '4' * (a[0] - four), '7' * (a[1] - seven)
            if (tem[-1] == '7') :

If `tem[-1] == '7'`, the printed string is `'7477'`. Otherwise, the print statement outputs `'7' + '4' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1) + '7'`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`. Depending on the if condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))`, the program either continues with `tem` containing alternating '4' and '7' starting with '4' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem2` containing alternating '7' and '4' starting with '7' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `four` and `seven2` incremented by the number of odd indices (`a3 + a4 // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `a3 + a4 // 2`), and `four2` and `seven` incremented by the number of even indices (`(a3 + a4 + 1) // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `(a3 + a4) // 2`), or it sets `tem` to `['7']`, `tem2` to `['7']`, `four` to 0, `seven2` to 1, `four2` to 0, `seven` to 1, and `i & 1` to false. If `tem[-1] == '7'`, the printed string is `'7477'`. Otherwise, the print statement outputs `'7' + '4' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1) + '7'`
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers, and `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`.

Otherwise, depending on the condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))`, the program either continues with `tem` containing alternating '4' and '7' starting with '4' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem2` containing alternating '7' and '4' starting with '7' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `four` and `seven2` incremented by the number of odd indices (`a3 + a4 // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `a3 + a4 // 2`), and `four2` and `seven` incremented by the number of even indices (`(a3 + a4 + 1) // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `(a3 + a4) // 2`), or it sets `tem` to `['7']`, `tem2` to `['7']`, `four` to 0, `seven2` to 1, `four2` to 0, `seven` to 1, and `i & 1` to false. If `tem[-1] == '7'`, the printed string is `'7477'`. Otherwise, the print statement outputs `'7' + '4' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1) + '7'`.
