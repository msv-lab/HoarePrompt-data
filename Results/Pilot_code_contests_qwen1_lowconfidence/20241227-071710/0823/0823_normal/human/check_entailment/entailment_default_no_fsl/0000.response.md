Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical flaw in handling certain cases, particularly when the required counts of substrings `47` and `74` are not equal. Specifically, the code fails to correctly manage the case where `a3` (count of `47`) is less than `a4` (count of `74`). 

Consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4 7 3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
The code does not handle this case correctly and may produce an incorrect output or crash due to the mismatch in the counts of `47` and `74`.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the counts of `47` and `74` are managed properly. The current implementation does not adequately handle cases where the counts of `47` and `74` are not equal, which leads to incorrect results. Thus, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
