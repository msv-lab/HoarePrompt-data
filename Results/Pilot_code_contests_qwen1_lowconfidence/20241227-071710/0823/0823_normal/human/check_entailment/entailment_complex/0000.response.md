Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle all cases where the counts of substrings `cnt(4)`, `cnt(7)`, `cnt(47)`, and `cnt(74)` must match the given inputs `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Handling `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)`**: 
   - The program attempts to ensure that `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` are equal to `a3` and `a4`, respectively, by constructing strings `tem` and `tem2` with alternating '4' and '7'. However, it does not account for the exact placement of these substrings to satisfy the conditions `cnt(47) = a3` and `cnt(74) = a4`.
   - For instance, consider the input `a1 = 2`, `a2 = 2`, `a3 = 1`, `a4 = 1`. The program should output `4774` because it contains exactly one occurrence of `47` and one occurrence of `74`. However, the current implementation might not produce such an output because it simply alternates '4' and '7' without ensuring the exact counts of `47` and `74`.

2. **Ensuring Minimum Lucky Number**:
   - The program tries to construct the minimum lucky number by appending '4' and '7' based on the counts. However, it does not guarantee that the constructed number is the smallest possible lucky number that meets the given conditions.
   - For example, consider the input `a1 = 4`, `a2 = 7`, `a3 = 3`, `a4 = 1`. The program should output a number like `44447777477774`, but the current implementation may not produce this exact pattern.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the condition `a3 < a4` by switching `tem` to `['7']` and `tem2` to `['7']`. This approach is not sufficient to guarantee the construction of the minimum lucky number and may lead to invalid outputs.
   - For example, with the input `a1 = 4`, `a2 = 7`, `a3 = 3`, `a4 = 1`, the program fails to produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum lucky number that satisfies the conditions for `cnt(4)`, `cnt(7)`, `cnt(47)`, and `cnt(74)`. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
