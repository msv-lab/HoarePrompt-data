You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya loves long lucky numbers very much. He is interested in the minimum lucky number d that meets some condition. Let cnt(x) be the number of occurrences of number x in number d as a substring. For example, if d = 747747, then cnt(4) = 2, cnt(7) = 4, cnt(47) = 2, cnt(74) = 2. Petya wants the following condition to fulfil simultaneously: cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. Petya is not interested in the occurrences of other numbers. Help him cope with this task.

Input

The single line contains four integers a1, a2, a3 and a4 (1 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 106).

Output

On the single line print without leading zeroes the answer to the problem — the minimum lucky number d such, that cnt(4) = a1, cnt(7) = a2, cnt(47) = a3, cnt(74) = a4. If such number does not exist, print the single number "-1" (without the quotes).

Examples

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a1, a2, a3, and a4 are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    a = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    if (abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        tem, tem2 = ['4'], ['7']
        four, seven = 1, 0
        four2, seven2 = 0, 1
        for i in range(a[2] + a[3]):
            if i & 1:
                tem.append('4')
                tem2.append('7')
                four += 1
                seven2 += 1
            else:
                tem.append('7')
                tem2.append('4')
                four2 += 1
                seven += 1
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`. If `i & 1` is true, then `tem` will contain alternating '4' and '7' starting with '4' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, and `tem2` will contain alternating '7' and '4' starting with '7' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`. The counts `four` and `seven2` will each be incremented by the number of odd indices (i.e., `a3 + a4 // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `a3 + a4 // 2`). The counts `four2` and `seven` will each be incremented by the number of even indices (i.e., `(a3 + a4 + 1) // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `(a3 + a4) // 2`). If `i & 1` is false, the same logic applies but starting with '7' and '4' respectively. If the loop does not execute (`a3 + a4 <= 0`), `i` remains 0, `tem` is `['4']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 1, `seven2` is 1, `four2` is 0, and `seven` is 0.
        if ((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1])) :
            print(-1)
        else :
            if ((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3]) :
                tem, four, seven = tem2, four2, seven2
            #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem` is `['7']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 0, `seven2` is 1, `four2` is 0, `seven` is 1, `i & 1` is false, and the condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is true, as the else part does not change these values.
            ext4, ext7 = '4' * (a[0] - four), '7' * (a[1] - seven)
            if (tem[-1] == '7') :
                print('%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:]), ext7))
            else :
                print('%s%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:-1]), ext7, tem[-1]))
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem` is `['7']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 0, `seven2` is 1, `four2` is 0, `seven` is 1, `i & 1` is false. If `tem[-1] == '7'`, the printed string is `'7477'`. Otherwise, the print statement outputs `'7' + '4' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1) + '7'`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`. Depending on the if condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))`, the program either continues with `tem` containing alternating '4' and '7' starting with '4' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem2` containing alternating '7' and '4' starting with '7' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `four` and `seven2` incremented by the number of odd indices (`a3 + a4 // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `a3 + a4 // 2`), and `four2` and `seven` incremented by the number of even indices (`(a3 + a4 + 1) // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `(a3 + a4) // 2`), or it sets `tem` to `['7']`, `tem2` to `['7']`, `four` to 0, `seven2` to 1, `four2` to 0, `seven` to 1, and `i & 1` to false. If `tem[-1] == '7'`, the printed string is `'7477'`. Otherwise, the print statement outputs `'7' + '4' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1) + '7'`
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers, and `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`. If `|a[2] - a[3]| > 1`, the printed value is `-1`. Otherwise, depending on the condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))`, the program either continues with `tem` containing alternating '4' and '7' starting with '4' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem2` containing alternating '7' and '4' starting with '7' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `four` and `seven2` incremented by the number of odd indices (`a3 + a4 // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `a3 + a4 // 2`), and `four2` and `seven` incremented by the number of even indices (`(a3 + a4 + 1) // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `(a3 + a4) // 2`), or it sets `tem` to `['7']`, `tem2` to `['7']`, `four` to 0, `seven2` to 1, `four2` to 0, `seven` to 1, and `i & 1` to false. If `tem[-1] == '7'`, the printed string is `'7477'`. Otherwise, the print statement outputs `'7' + '4' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1) + '7'`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
