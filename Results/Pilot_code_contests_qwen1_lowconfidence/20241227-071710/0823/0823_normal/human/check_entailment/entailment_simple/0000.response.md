Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to correctly handle certain edge cases and conditions, particularly when the counts of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` are not balanced.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Handling Unbalanced Counts**:
   - The program checks if `abs(a[2] - a[3]) > 1` and prints `-1` if the counts of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` are unbalanced. However, it should also check if `a[2] < a[3]` or `a[3] < a[2]` and ensure that the counts are balanced. The current logic only checks the absolute difference, which is insufficient.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Lucky Number**:
   - The program constructs the lucky number by alternating `4` and `7` based on the sum of `a[2] + a[3]`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting number will have the exact counts of `4`, `7`, `47`, and `74` as specified. It simply creates a sequence of alternating `4` and `7` which may not satisfy the required counts.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `a1` and `a2` are very large and the constructed number cannot accommodate the required counts of substrings `47` and `74`. For example, if `a[0]` (count of `4`) is much larger than `a[2] + a[3]`, the constructed number will not have enough `4`s to form the required number of `47` substrings.

#### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
4 7 3 1
```

- According to the problem, we need a lucky number where:
  - `cnt(4) = 4`
  - `cnt(7) = 7`
  - `cnt(47) = 3`
  - `cnt(74) = 1`

- The program attempts to construct the number by alternating `4` and `7` until the total count of `47` and `74` reaches the required values. However, this approach will fail because it does not ensure the exact counts of `4` and `7`.

The correct solution would involve a more complex logic to ensure that the constructed number meets all the specified conditions. For example, one possible approach could involve dynamically constructing the number while keeping track of the counts of `4`, `7`, `47`, and `74` and ensuring they match the required values.

Given these issues, the program does not always follow the problem description and therefore is incorrect.
