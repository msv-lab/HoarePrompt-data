Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it constructs the lucky number. Specifically, it does not ensure that the counts of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` are correctly maintained. 

For example, consider the input `a1 = 4`, `a2 = 3`, `a3 = 2`, `a4 = 1`. According to the problem description, we need to construct the smallest lucky number where there are 4 occurrences of '4', 3 occurrences of '7', 2 occurrences of '47', and 1 occurrence of '74'. 

However, the program constructs the number in a way that does not guarantee these counts. It alternates between appending '4' and '7' to two separate lists (`tem` and `tem2`) and then tries to append extra '4's and '7's to meet the required counts. This approach does not necessarily ensure that the counts of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` will be exactly as specified.

To illustrate, let's consider the construction process:

1. For the first two characters, it appends '4' and '7' to both lists, ensuring `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` are incremented.
2. For subsequent characters, it alternates between '4' and '7' but does not maintain the exact count of `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)` as required.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly handle the counts for `cnt(47)` and `cnt(74)`, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
