Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the constructed number is the minimum possible lucky number that satisfies the conditions. Here are a few issues:

1. **Construction Logic**: The code constructs two strings `tem` and `tem2` with alternating '4' and '7'. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting number is the minimum possible lucky number. For example, if `a1 = 2`, `a2 = 2`, `a3 = 1`, and `a4 = 1`, the code will produce "4774", which is not the minimum possible number (the correct answer is "4474").

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where the number of '47' and '74' pairs do not match properly. For instance, if `a1 = 4`, `a2 = 7`, `a3 = 3`, and `a4 = 1`, the code incorrectly prints `-1` because it assumes `a3` and `a4` cannot differ by more than 1. However, a valid solution exists: "4747474".

3. **Minimum Construction**: The construction logic should ensure that the number of '47' and '74' pairs is balanced correctly while minimizing the overall number. The current approach might lead to constructing numbers that are not minimal.

These issues indicate that the code does not fully meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
