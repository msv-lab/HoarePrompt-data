In the initial state, we have:
- `a3 + a4 > 0`
- `i` is 2
- `tem` is `['4', '7']` or `['7', '7']`
- `tem2` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`
- `four` is increased by 1
- `seven` is increased by 2
- `four2` is increased by 2

The code snippet is:
```python
tem.append('4')
```

This code appends the string `'4'` to the list `tem`. Since `tem` was already defined as `['4', '7']` or `['7', '7']` in the initial state, appending `'4'` to it will change its value. 

Therefore, the updated state of `tem` will be:
- `tem` is `['4', '7', '4']` or `['7', '7', '4']`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 2, `tem` is `['4', '7', '4']` or `['7', '7', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`, `four` is increased by 1, `seven` is increased by 2, `four2` is increased by 2**
