`tem2` is appended with the value `'7'`. The previous values of the other variables are as follows: `a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 1, `tem` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7']` or `['4']`, and `four` or `four2` is increased by 1, `seven` or `seven2` is increased by 1. After appending `'7'` to `tem2`, the value of `tem2` will be `['7', '7']` or `['4', '7']`.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 1, `tem` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7', '7']` or `['4', '7']`, `four` or `four2` is increased by 1, `seven` or `seven2` is increased by 1**
