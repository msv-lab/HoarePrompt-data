Functionality: **The function reads four non-negative integers \(a1, a2, a3,\) and \(a4\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^6\). It checks if the absolute difference between \(a3\) and \(a4\) is greater than 1. If it is, the function prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it constructs two strings, `tem` and `tem2`, each of length \(a3 + a4\), containing alternating '4' and '7'. If the total number of '4's and '7's in both `tem` and `tem2` exceed the limits specified by \(a1\) and \(a2\), or if \(a3 < a4\), it switches `tem` to contain only '7's and `tem2` to contain only '7's, setting the respective counters to zero. Finally, it prints a string based on whether `tem` ends with '7' or not. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \(a3 + a4 \leq 0\), the loop does not execute, and the initial values of `tem` and `tem2` are printed without any changes.
- If \(a3 = a4\), the loop will alternate starting with '4' and '7' respectively, and the final printed string will be constructed accordingly.
- If \(a3 \neq a4\) and \(|a3 - a4| > 1\), the function immediately prints \(-1\).
- The function does not handle cases where \(a1, a2, a3,\) or \(a4\) are outside the range \([1, 10^6]\), although this is constrained by the problem definition.
