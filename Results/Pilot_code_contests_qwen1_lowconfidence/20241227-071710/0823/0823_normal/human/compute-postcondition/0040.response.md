Postcondition: ***`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`. `tem` contains alternating '4' and '7' starting with '4' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, and `tem2` contains alternating '7' and '4' starting with '7' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`. `four` and `seven2` are incremented by the number of odd indices (`a3 + a4 // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `a3 + a4 // 2`). `four2` and `seven` are incremented by the number of even indices (`(a3 + a4 + 1) // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `(a3 + a4) // 2`). The if condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))` is true.***

This postcondition includes all the details from the precondition and specifies the state of the program after the if condition is evaluated as true.
