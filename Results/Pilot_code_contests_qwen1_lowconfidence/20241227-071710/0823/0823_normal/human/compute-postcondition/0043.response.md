Postcondition: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem` contains alternating '4' and '7' starting with '4' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem2` contains alternating '7' and '4' starting with '7' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `four` and `seven2` are each incremented by the number of odd indices (`a3 + a4 // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `a3 + a4 // 2`), `four2` and `seven` are each incremented by the number of even indices (`(a3 + a4 + 1) // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `(a3 + a4) // 2`), `i & 1` is false, `tem` is `['4']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 1, `seven2` is 1, `four2` is 0, and `seven` is 0, and the condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is true**.
