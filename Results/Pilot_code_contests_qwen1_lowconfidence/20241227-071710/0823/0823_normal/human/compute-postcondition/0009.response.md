The code appends the string `'4'` to the list `tem`. Since `tem` was not initialized before this line, it will be created as an empty list and then appended with `'4'`. The values of `a3 + a4` being greater than 0 and `i` being 0 are unchanged.

Output State: **`a3 + a4` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `tem` is ['4']**
