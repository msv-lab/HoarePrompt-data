`tem2` appends the value `'4'` to itself. The original value of `tem2` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`. After appending `'4'`, the new value of `tem2` becomes `['7', '4', '4']` or `['4', '4', '4']`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 2, `tem` is `['4', '7', '7']` or `['7', '7', '7']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4', '4']` or `['4', '4', '4']`, `four` is increased by 1, `seven` is increased by 2, `four2` is increased by 2.**
