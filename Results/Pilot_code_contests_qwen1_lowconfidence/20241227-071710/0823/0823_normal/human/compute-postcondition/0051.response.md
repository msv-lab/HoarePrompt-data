Postcondition: ***`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem` is `['7']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 0, `seven2` is 1, `four2` is 0, `seven` is 1, `i & 1` is false. If `tem[-1] == '7'`, the printed string is `'7477'`. Otherwise, the print statement outputs `'7' + '4' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1) + '7'`.***
