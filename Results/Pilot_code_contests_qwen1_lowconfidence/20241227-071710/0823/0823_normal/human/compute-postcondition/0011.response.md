`four` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `four` is not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a3 + a4` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `tem` is ['4']; `tem2` is ['7']; `four` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a3 + a4` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `tem` is ['4']; `tem2` is ['7']; `four` is increased by 1**
