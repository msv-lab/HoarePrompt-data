The value of `four2` is incremented by 1, so `four2` becomes `four2 + 1`. The previous value of `four2` was increased by 2, so the new value of `four2` is `4`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 2, `tem` is `['4', '7', '7']` or `['7', '7', '7']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4', '4']` or `['4', '4', '4']`, `four` is increased by 1, `seven` is increased by 2, `four2` is 4.**
