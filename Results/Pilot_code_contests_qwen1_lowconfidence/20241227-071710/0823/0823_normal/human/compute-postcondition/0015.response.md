The code snippet appends the string `'4'` to the list `tem2`. Initially, `tem` is `['7']`, but `tem2` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is assumed to be empty. After executing `tem2.append('4')`, `tem2` will contain the value `['4']`.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 0; `tem` is ['7'], `tem2` is ['4']**
