`tem` appends `'4'` to its list. Initially, `tem` is either `['4']` or `['7']`. In both cases, appending `'4'` results in `tem` being `['4', '4']` or `['7', '4']`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 1, `tem` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7']` or `['4']`, `four` or `four2` is increased by 1, `seven` or `seven2` is increased by 1**
