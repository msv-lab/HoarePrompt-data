The value of `four` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `four` was increased by 1, so it has already been incremented once. Therefore, `four` will be incremented by another 1, making it increased by 2 in total from the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 2, `tem` is `['4', '7', '4']` or `['7', '7', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4', '7']` or `['4', '4', '7']`, `four` is increased by 2, `seven` is increased by 2, `four2` is increased by 2**
