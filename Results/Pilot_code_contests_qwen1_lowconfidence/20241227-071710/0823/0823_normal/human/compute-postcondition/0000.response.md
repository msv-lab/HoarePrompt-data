The code `a = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. 

Given the initial state where `a1, a2, a3, and a4` are non-negative integers such that `1 â‰¤ a1, a2, a3, a4 â‰¤ 10^6`, the values of `a1, a2, a3, and a4` will now be stored in the list `a` as integers.

Since the exact values of `a1, a2, a3, and a4` are not specified, we represent them as generic integers within the range given.

Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is an integer, `a4` is an integer; `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`**
