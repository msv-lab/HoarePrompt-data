`tem2` is appended with the value `'7'`. The previous values of `tem2` can be either `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`. After appending `'7'`, `tem2` will become `['7', '4', '7']` or `['4', '4', '7']`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 2, `tem` is `['4', '7', '4']` or `['7', '7', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4', '7']` or `['4', '4', '7']`, `four` is increased by 1, `seven` is increased by 2, `four2` is increased by 2**
