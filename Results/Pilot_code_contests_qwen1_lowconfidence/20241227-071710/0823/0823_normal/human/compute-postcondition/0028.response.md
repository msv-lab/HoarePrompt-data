Postcondition: ***`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 1. If `i & 1` is true, then `tem` becomes `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`, `tem2` becomes `['7', '7']` or `['4', '7']`, either `four + 1` or `four2 + 1` is increased by 1, and `seven` or `seven2` is equal to `eight`. Otherwise, `tem` becomes `['4', '7']` or `['7', '7']`, `tem2` becomes `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`, `four` is increased by 1, `seven` is increased by 2, and `four2` is increased by 2.***
