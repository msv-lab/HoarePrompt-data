The code snippet `tem.append('7')` adds the string `'7'` to the list `tem`. Since `tem` was previously `['4', '7']` or `['7', '7']`, adding `'7'` to it will change its value.

Given the initial conditions:

- \( a3 + a4 > 0 \)
- \( i = 2 \)
- `tem` is `['4', '7']` or `['7', '7']`
- `tem2` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`
- `four` is increased by 1
- `seven` is increased by 2
- `four2` is increased by 2

After executing `tem.append('7')`:

- The value of `tem` changes to `['4', '7', '7']` or `['7', '7', '7']`.

Thus, the updated state is:

**State: `a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 2, `tem` is `['4', '7', '7']` or `['7', '7', '7']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`, `four` is increased by 1, `seven` is increased by 2, `four2` is increased by 2.**

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 2, `tem` is `['4', '7', '7']` or `['7', '7', '7']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`, `four` is increased by 1, `seven` is increased by 2, `four2` is increased by 2.**
