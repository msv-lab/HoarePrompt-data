`tem2` is appended with the value '7'. The value of `a3 + a4` being greater than 0 and the value of `i` being 0 remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a3 + a4` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `tem` is ['4']; `tem2` is ['7'].

Output State: **`a3 + a4` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `tem` is ['4']; `tem2` is ['7']**
