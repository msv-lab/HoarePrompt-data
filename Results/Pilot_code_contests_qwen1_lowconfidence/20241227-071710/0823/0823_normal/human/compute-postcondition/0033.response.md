`seven2` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `seven2` is 3 (since it was previously increased by 2). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 2, `tem` is `['4', '7', '4']` or `['7', '7', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4', '7']` or `['4', '4', '7']`, `four` is increased by 2, `seven` is increased by 2, `four2` is increased by 2, `seven2` is 3.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 2, `tem` is `['4', '7', '4']` or `['7', '7', '4']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4', '7']` or `['4', '4', '7']`, `four` is increased by 2, `seven` is increased by 2, `four2` is increased by 2, `seven2` is 3**
