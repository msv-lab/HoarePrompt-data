The code appends the value '7' to the list `tem`. The initial state specifies that `tem` is either `['4']` or `['7']`. After appending '7', `tem` will be `['4', '7']` if it was initially `['4']`, or `['7', '7']` if it was initially `['7']`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 1, `tem` is `['4', '7']` or `['7', '7']`, `tem2` is `['7']` or `['4']`, `four` or `four2` is increased by 1, `seven` or `seven2` is increased by 1**
