The code snippet `ext4, ext7 = '4' * (a[0] - four), '7' * (a[1] - seven)` impacts the values of `ext4` and `ext7` by repeating the characters '4' and '7' respectively a number of times determined by the differences between the elements of the list `a` and the variables `four` and `seven`.

From the initial state:
- `a3 + a4 > 0` (unchanged)
- `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1` (unchanged)
- `tem` is `['7']` (unchanged)
- `tem2` is `['7']` (unchanged)
- `four` is 0 (unchanged)
- `seven2` is 1 (unchanged)
- `four2` is 0 (unchanged)
- `seven` is 1 (unchanged)
- `i & 1` is false (unchanged)
- `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is true (unchanged)

Let's calculate the new values of `ext4` and `ext7`:
- `ext4 = '4' * (a[0] - four) = '4' * (a[0] - 0) = '4' * a[0]`
- `ext7 = '7' * (a[1] - seven) = '7' * (a[1] - 1)`

Since `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we'll keep it as `a` in the output state.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem` is `['7']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 0, `seven2` is 1, `four2` is 0, `seven` is 1, `i & 1` is false, `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is true, `ext4` is `'4' * a[0]`, `ext7` is `'7' * (a[1] - 1)`**
