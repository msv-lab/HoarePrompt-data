`seven` is incremented by 1, and the value of `a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` being 0, `tem` being `['7']`, `tem2` being `['4']`, and `four2` being `four2 + 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 0; `tem` is `['7']`, `tem2` is `['4']`; `four2` is `four2 + 1`; `seven` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 0; `tem` is `['7']`, `tem2` is `['4']`; `four2` is `four2 + 1`; `seven` is increased by 1**
