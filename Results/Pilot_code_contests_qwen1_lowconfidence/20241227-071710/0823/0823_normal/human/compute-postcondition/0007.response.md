Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop control variable and condition**: The loop is controlled by `i` and runs for `a[2] + a[3]` iterations. For the loop to execute, `a[2] + a[3]` must be greater than 0.

2. **Determine the initial values of `a2` and `a3`**:
   - From the given state, we know `a2` is an integer and `a3` is an integer.
   - We need to check if their sum is greater than 0.

3. **Check the specific values**:
   - `a2` and `a3` are elements of the list `a`, where `a = [a1, a2, a3, a4]`.
   - Therefore, `a[2] = a3` and `a[3] = a4`.

4. **Condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The condition `a[2] + a[3] > 0` must be true, which translates to `a3 + a4 > 0`.

5. **Additional states to adjust**:
   - We need to ensure `i` starts at 0 (the default value for `range`).
   - The initial value of `tem` and `tem2` lists are irrelevant for the loop execution but are provided for completeness.
   - The values of `four`, `seven`, `four2`, and `seven2` are also irrelevant for the loop execution.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `a3 + a4 > 0`
- `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop (default behavior of `range`)

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`a3 + a4 > 0, i is 0`**
