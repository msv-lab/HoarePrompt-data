The code `tem2.append('4')` appends the string `'4'` to the list `tem2`. Since the initial state mentions that `tem2` is either `['7']` or `['4']`, appending `'4'` to `tem2` will result in `tem2` being `['7', '4']` in both cases.

The other variables (`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i`, `tem`, `four` or `four2`, `seven` or `seven2`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 1, `tem` is `['4', '7']` or `['7', '7']`, `tem2` is `['7', '4']` or `['4', '4']`, `four` or `four2` is increased by 1, `seven` or `seven2` is increased by 1**
