Let's analyze the given Python code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `a3 + a4 > 0`
   - `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`
   - `tem` is `['7']`
   - `tem2` is `['7']`
   - `four` is 0
   - `seven2` is 1
   - `four2` is 0
   - `seven` is 1
   - `i & 1` is false (which means `i` is even)
   - `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is false
   - `ext4` is `'4' * a[0]`
   - `ext7` is `'7' * (a[1] - 1)`

2. The code snippet:
   ```python
   print('%s%s%s%s%s' % (tem[0], ext4, ''.join(tem[1:-1]), ext7, tem[-1]))
   ```

3. Analyzing the code:
   - `tem[0]` is `'7'`.
   - `ext4` is a string of `'4'` repeated `a[0]` times.
   - `tem[1:-1]` is an empty list because `tem` only has one element (`['7']`), so `tem[1:-1]` results in an empty string.
   - `ext7` is a string of `'7'` repeated `(a[1] - 1)` times.
   - `tem[-1]` is `'7'`.

4. Combining these, the print statement simplifies to:
   ```python
   print('7%s7' % ('' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1)))
   ```

5. Since `a[0]` is not specified, let's denote it as `n`. And `a[1]` is not specified, let's denote it as `m`.

Therefore, the print statement becomes:
```python
print('7' + '4' * n + '' + '7' * (m - 1) + '7')
```

Since `a[1]` (denoted as `m`) is at least 1 (as `tem` is `['7']` and `a[1]` must be at least 1 to avoid an empty string), the print statement simplifies to:
```python
print('7' + '4' * n + '7' * (m - 1) + '7')
```

Given the initial conditions and the nature of the print statement, the final output will be:
```python
'7444...477'  # where there are 'n' '4's followed by (m-1) '7's
```

However, since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can generalize the output based on the constraints.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem` is `['7']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 0, `seven2` is 1, `four2` is 0, `seven` is 1, `i & 1` is false, `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is false, `ext4` is `'4' * a[0]`, `ext7` is `'7' * (a[1] - 1)`, the print statement outputs `'7' + '4' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1) + '7'`**.
