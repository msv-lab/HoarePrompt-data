Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers, and `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`. If `|a[2] - a[3]| > 1`, the printed value is `-1`. Otherwise, depending on the condition `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) and (four2 > a[0] or seven2 > a[1]))`, the program either continues with `tem` containing alternating '4' and '7' starting with '4' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem2` containing alternating '7' and '4' starting with '7' for each odd index up to `a3 + a4 - 1`, `four` and `seven2` incremented by the number of odd indices (`a3 + a4 // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `a3 + a4 // 2`), and `four2` and `seven` incremented by the number of even indices (`(a3 + a4 + 1) // 2` if `a3 + a4` is odd, otherwise `(a3 + a4) // 2`), or it sets `tem` to `['7']`, `tem2` to `['7']`, `four` to 0, `seven2` to 1, `four2` to 0, `seven` to 1, and `i & 1` to false. If `tem[-1] == '7'`, the printed string is `'7477'`. Otherwise, the print statement outputs `'7' + '4' * a[0] + '7' * (a[1] - 1) + '7'`.***
