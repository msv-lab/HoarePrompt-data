The code appends the string '7' to the list `tem`. Since `tem` was not defined in the initial state, it implies that `tem` is a list. The initial state does not provide any specific value for `tem`, so after appending '7', `tem` will contain ['7'].

The other variables, `a3 + a4 > 0` and `i is 0`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is 0; `tem` is ['7']**
