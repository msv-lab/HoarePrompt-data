The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the output of `-1`.

Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is an integer, `a4` is an integer; `a` is a list containing `[a1, a2, a3, a4]`; printed value is `-1`**
