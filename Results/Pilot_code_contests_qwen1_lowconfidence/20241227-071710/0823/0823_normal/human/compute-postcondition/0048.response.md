The code prints a formatted string using the values from the list `tem` and the strings `ext4` and `ext7`. Let's break down the components:

1. `tem[0]`: The first element of `tem` is '7'.
2. `ext4`: This is the string `'4' * a[0]`. Since `a[0]` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but it will be a string of '4's repeated `a[0]` times.
3. `"".join(tem[1:])`: This joins all elements of `tem` starting from the second element. Since the last element of `tem` is '7', the only other element (first element) is also '7'. Thus, `"".join(tem[1:])` results in an empty string because there are no other elements to join.
4. `ext7`: This is the string `'7' * (a[1] - 1)`. Similarly, since `a[1]` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but it will be a string of '7's repeated `(a[1] - 1)` times.

Given the above, the print statement will output: `'7477'`.

Since the print statement does not assign any new values to existing variables, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a3 + a4 > 0`, `i` is `a3 + a4 - 1`, `tem` is `['7']`, `tem2` is `['7']`, `four` is 0, `seven2` is 1, `four2` is 0, `seven` is 1, `i & 1` is false, `((four > a[0] or seven > a[1]) or a[2] < a[3])` is true, `ext4` is `'4' * a[0]`, `ext7` is `'7' * (a[1] - 1)`, and the printed string is `'7477'`.**
