The function reads four non-negative integers \(a1, a2, a3,\) and \(a4\) from standard input, where \(1 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^6\). It checks if the absolute difference between \(a3\) and \(a4\) is greater than 1. If it is, the function prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it constructs two strings, `tem` and `tem2`, each of length \(a3 + a4\), containing alternating '4' and '7'. If the total number of '4's and '7's in both `tem` and `tem2` exceed the limits specified by \(a1\) and \(a2\), or if \(a3 < a4\), it switches `tem` to contain only '7's and `tem2` to contain only '7's, setting the respective counters to zero. Finally, it prints a string based on whether `tem` ends with '7' or not. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
