`dp2` is assigned the value of `dp1.copy()`, which means `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`. The original values of `dp1` and `dp2` before the copy operation remain unchanged. The values of other variables (`n`, `a`, `B`, `k`, and `cur`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `B` is a list of at least one integer, `dp1` is equal to `dp2`, `k` is defined, `cur` is `a - b * k`, `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`**
