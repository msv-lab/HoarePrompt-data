Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least two positive integers, `B` is a list of at least two integers, `dp1` is a dictionary containing key-value pairs initially, `k` is defined, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to the maximum value of `dp2[x + cur]` and `y + a` for every key-value pair `(x, y)` in `dp1` after processing all key-value pairs in `dp1`.**
