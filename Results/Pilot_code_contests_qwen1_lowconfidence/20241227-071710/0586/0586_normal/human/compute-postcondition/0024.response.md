The code updates `dp2[x + cur]` to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. Here, `x` and `y` refer to the last key-value pair processed in `dp1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least two positive integers, `B` is a list of at least two integers, `dp1` must still contain key-value pairs, `k` is defined, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to `max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)` where `(x, y)` is the last key-value pair processed in `dp1`.**
