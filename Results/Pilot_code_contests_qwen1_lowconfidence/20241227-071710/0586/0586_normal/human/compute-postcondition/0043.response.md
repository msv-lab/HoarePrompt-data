Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `B` is a list of `n` integers, `dp1` is a dictionary with keys as integers and values as integers, `pos` is 0. If `dp1[0]` is greater than 0, the function reflects the maximum values obtained by iterating through `a` and `B` using the defined process, and does not print anything. Otherwise, `dp1` is updated to reflect the maximum values obtained by iterating through `a` and `B` using the defined process, and `-1` is printed.**
