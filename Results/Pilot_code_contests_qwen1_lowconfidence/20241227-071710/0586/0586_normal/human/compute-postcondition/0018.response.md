The code `dp2 = dp1.copy()` creates a copy of the list `dp1` and assigns it to `dp2`. This means that `dp2` now points to a new list that is a copy of the original `dp1`. However, the content of `dp1` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `B`, `dp1`, `k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of at least two positive integers; `B` is a list of at least two integers; `dp1` and `dp2` are lists pointing to different objects, where `dp2` contains a copy of the contents of `dp1`; `k` needs to be defined for the operation `cur = a - b * k` to be valid.**
