The code `dp2 = dp1.copy()` creates a copy of the list `dp1` and assigns it to `dp2`. Since no specific values for `dp1` are provided, the output state will only indicate that `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `B`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `B` is a list of at least one integer, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists such that `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`.**
