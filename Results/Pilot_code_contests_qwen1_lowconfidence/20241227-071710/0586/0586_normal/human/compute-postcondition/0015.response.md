The line of code `dp1 = dp2` assigns the list `dp2` to the variable `dp1`. This means that `dp1` now points to the same list object as `dp2`. However, this does not change the contents of the lists themselves, only the reference.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of at least one positive integer.
- `B` is a list of at least one integer.
- `dp1` and `dp2` are lists such that `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`, and `dp2` was updated as described in the problem statement.

After executing the line `dp1 = dp2`, `dp1` and `dp2` now both point to the same list object. The content of the list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of at least one positive integer; `B` is a list of at least one integer; `dp1` and `dp2` are lists pointing to the same object, where `dp2` contains the updated maximum values as per the described process.**
