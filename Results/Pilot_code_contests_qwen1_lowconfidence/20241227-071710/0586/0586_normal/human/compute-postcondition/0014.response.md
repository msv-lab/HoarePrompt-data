Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `B` is a list of at least one integer, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists such that `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`, and `dp2` is updated such that for each key `x + cur` in `dp1`, `dp2[x + cur]` contains the maximum value between its original value (if any) and the sum of the corresponding value `y` in `dp1` and the element `a` from the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each key-value pair `(x, y)` in `dp1`.
- For each iteration, it updates `dp2[x + cur]` to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`.
- This process continues until all key-value pairs in `dp1` have been processed.
- Since `dp2` is initially a copy of `dp1`, after the loop completes, `dp2` will have the same keys as `dp1`, but the values will reflect the maximum values computed during the loop.
- The variables `n`, `a`, `B`, and `cur` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
