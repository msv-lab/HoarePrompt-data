The line of code `dp1 = dp2` assigns the dictionary `dp2` to the variable `dp1`. This means that `dp1` now references the same dictionary object as `dp2`, rather than having its own separate copy. The values of `n`, `a`, `B`, `dp1` (before the assignment), `k`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `B` is a list of at least one integer, `dp1` references the same dictionary as `dp2`, `k` is defined, `cur` is `a - b * k`, `dp2` is a dictionary where each key-value pair (x, val) in `dp1` is updated such that `dp2[x + cur]` is set to `max(dp2.get(x + cur, 0), y + a)` for every (x, y) in `dp1`.**
