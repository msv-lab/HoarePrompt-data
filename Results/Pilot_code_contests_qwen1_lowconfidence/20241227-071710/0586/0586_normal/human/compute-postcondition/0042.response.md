The code prints `-1`. Printing does not change the values of variables, so the only affected state is the printed value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `B` is a list of `n` integers, `dp1` is a dictionary with keys as integers and values as integers, `pos` is 0, `dp1` is updated to reflect the maximum values obtained by iterating through `a` and `B` using the defined process, and `dp1[0]` is less than or equal to 0; printed value is `-1`.**
