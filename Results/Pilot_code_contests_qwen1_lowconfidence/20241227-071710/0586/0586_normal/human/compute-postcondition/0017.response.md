The code `cur = a - b * k` attempts to assign a value to `cur`, but there are issues with the syntax. It seems like `a` and `b` are lists, and `k` is not defined in the provided context. Assuming the intention was to perform element-wise subtraction between lists `a` and `b * k`, where `k` is a scalar, the operation cannot be directly performed without defining `k`.

Given the initial state and the lack of definition for `k`, we cannot proceed with the calculation as is. However, assuming `k` is a scalar and the intention was to perform such an operation, let's consider the impact:

- `a` and `b` are lists of at least two positive integers.
- `k` is not defined, so let's assume it is an integer for the sake of example.

Let's assume `k` is a defined integer for demonstration purposes. For instance, if `k = 1`:
- `cur` would be assigned the result of `a - b * 1` (element-wise subtraction).

Since `k` is not defined, the exact value of `cur` cannot be determined. Therefore, we must indicate that `k` needs to be defined for the operation to be valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of at least two positive integers; `B` is a list of at least two integers; `dp1` and `dp2` are lists pointing to the same object, where `dp2` contains the updated maximum values; `k` needs to be defined for the operation `cur = a - b * k` to be valid.**
