The code updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. The values of `n`, `a`, `B`, `dp1`, `k`, `x`, `cur`, `y` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is to the value of `dp2[x + cur]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least two positive integers, `B` is a list of at least two integers, `dp1` still contains key-value pairs, `k` is defined, `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to `max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)`**
