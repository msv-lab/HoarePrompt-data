Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of at least one positive integer.
- `B` is a list of at least one integer.
- `dp1` and `dp2` are lists such that `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`.
- `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair.
- `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to `y + a` if `y + a` is greater than the current value of `dp2[x + cur]`.
- `x` changes to the next key in `dp1` and `y` changes to the corresponding value of the next key in `dp1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for (x, y) in dp1.iteritems():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each key-value pair `(x, y)` in `dp1`.

2. **Iteration Update**:
   - `x` is set to the next key in `dp1`.
   - `y` is set to the corresponding value of the next key in `dp1`.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `dp1` must still have at least one key-value pair.

### Adjusted States:
- Since `x` and `y` are being updated to the next key-value pair in `dp1`, we need to ensure that there is at least one key-value pair left in `dp1`.
- `dp2` remains a copy of `dp1` and is not directly modified within the loop, so its state remains the same.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `dp1` must still have at least one key-value pair.

**State:**
**`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `B` is a list of at least one integer, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists such that `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`, `dp1` must have at least one key-value pair, and `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to `y + a` if `y + a` is greater than the current value of `dp2[x + cur]`, and `x` changes to the next key in `dp1` and `y` changes to the corresponding value of the next key in `dp1`.**

However, to specifically highlight the change needed for the next iteration:
- **`dp1` must have at least two key-value pairs remaining.**

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `B` is a list of at least one integer, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists such that `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`, `dp1` must have at least two key-value pairs, and `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to `y + a` if `y + a` is greater than the current value of `dp2[x + cur]`, and `x` changes to the next key in `dp1` and `y` changes to the corresponding value of the next key in `dp1`.**

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `B` is a list of at least one integer, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists such that `dp2` is a copy of `dp1`, `dp1` must have at least two key-value pairs, and `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to `y + a` if `y + a` is greater than the current value of `dp2[x + cur]`, and `x` changes to the next key in `dp1` and `y` changes to the corresponding value of the next key in `dp1`.**
