The code updates the value of `dp2[x + cur]` to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of at least one positive integer.
- `B` is a list of at least one integer.
- `dp1` remains unchanged.
- `k` is defined.
- `cur` is `a - b * k`.

The only change in this code snippet is the assignment to `dp2[x + cur]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `B` is a list of at least one integer, `dp1` is unchanged, `k` is defined, `cur` is `a - b * k`, `dp2` is a copy of `dp1` with the value at key `x + cur` updated to `max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)`**.
