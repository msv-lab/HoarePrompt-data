The code `A = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The result is stored in the variable `A`. 

Since `n` and `k` are integers obtained from `raw_input().split()` and `a` and `b` are lists of `n` positive integers each, the initial state indicates that `n` and `k` are integers, and `a` and `b` are lists of `n` positive integers.

After executing the code, the list `A` will contain the integers split from the input, and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `b` is a list of `n` positive integers, and `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
