The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly in the given function signature. However, based on the problem description, it implies that the function should operate on two lists `a` and `b` and an integer `k`, where:
- `a` is a list containing `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100, inclusive, representing the tastes of the fruits.
- `b` is a list containing `n` positive integers each between 1 and 100, inclusive, representing the calories of the fruits.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.

Since these parameters are not included in the function signature, we need to assume they are passed to the function in some way not shown here. Given the constraints and the typical structure of such problems, the function likely accepts these parameters implicitly or through some other means (e.g., global variables).

Based on the provided output cases, the function does not return any specific value but rather processes the lists `a` and `b` and the integer `k`. Since the exact output is not specified in terms of returning a value, we infer that the function performs some operation and does not return anything explicitly.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes two lists `a` and `b` containing positive integers within specified ranges, along with an integer `k`, without returning any value.**
