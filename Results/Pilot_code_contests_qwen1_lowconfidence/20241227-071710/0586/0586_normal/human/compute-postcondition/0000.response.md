`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`. Since `raw_input()` reads a line of input and returns it as a string, and `split()` splits this string into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, the values of `n` and `k` are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers obtained from `raw_input().split()`, and `a` and `b` are lists of n positive integers each between 1 and 100, inclusive.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers obtained from `raw_input().split()`, and `a` and `b` are lists of n positive integers each between 1 and 100, inclusive.**
