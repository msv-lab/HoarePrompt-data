Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of at least one positive integer, `B` is a list of at least one integer, `dp1` is unchanged, `k` is defined, `cur` is `a - b * k`, `dp2` is a dictionary where each key-value pair (x, val) in `dp1` is updated such that `dp2[x + cur]` is set to `max(dp2.get(x + cur, 0), y + a)` for every (x, y) in `dp1`.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in any operations inside the loop.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not involved in any operations inside the loop.
- `B` remains unchanged as it is not involved in any operations inside the loop.
- `dp1` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not involved in any operations inside the loop.
- `cur` is computed as `a - b * k` and remains unchanged during the loop.
- `dp2` is a copy of `dp1` initially. During each iteration of the loop, the value of `dp2[x + cur]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `y + a` for every `(x, y)` in `dp1`.

Since the loop iterates over all key-value pairs in `dp1` and updates `dp2` accordingly, after all iterations, `dp2` will contain the updated values based on the operations performed inside the loop.
