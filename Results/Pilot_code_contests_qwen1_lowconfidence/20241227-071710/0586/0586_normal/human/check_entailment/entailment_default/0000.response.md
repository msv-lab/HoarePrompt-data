Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the code is incorrect for solving this problem. The goal is to find the maximum sum of the tastes of the fruits such that the ratio of the total taste to the total calories equals `k`. However, the code attempts to solve a different problem where it tries to maximize the sum of `a - b * k` values while ensuring the sum remains non-negative.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

Input:
```
3 2
10 8 1
2 7 1
```

Expected output:
```
18
```

Explanation: We can choose the first and second fruits, which have tastes 10 and 8 and calories 2 and 7, respectively. The total taste is 18 and the total calories are 9, and the ratio is 18 / 9 = 2, which matches `k`.

However, the provided code would not produce the correct result because it does not correctly calculate the required ratio and instead tries to maximize a different value.

For instance, the code would process the values as follows:
- For the first fruit: `cur = 10 - 2*2 = 6`, and update `dp1` with `dp1[6] = 10`.
- For the second fruit: `cur = 8 - 7*2 = -6`, and update `dp2` with `dp2[-6] = 18`.
- For the third fruit: `cur = 1 - 1*2 = -1`, and update `dp3` with `dp3[-7] = 19`.

This incorrect approach does not ensure that the final sum of tastes divided by the sum of calories equals `k`.

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
