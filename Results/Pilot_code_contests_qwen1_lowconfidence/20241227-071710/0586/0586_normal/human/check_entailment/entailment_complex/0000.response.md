Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program follows the problem description:

1. **Problem Description and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values \( n \), \( k \), the list of fruit tastes \( A \), and the list of fruit calories \( B \).
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 10 \) are respected.
   - The lists \( A \) and \( B \) are processed correctly.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - A dictionary `dp1` is used to store intermediate results of the dynamic programming approach.
   - The key `0` in `dp1` is initialized to `0`, which serves as the base case.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - For each fruit, the program calculates `cur = a - b * k`.
   - It then updates the `dp1` dictionary by considering whether to include the current fruit in the salad or not.
   - The state transition is handled by copying `dp1` to `dp2` and updating `dp2` based on the new values.

4. **Final Output**:
   - If `dp1[0]` is greater than 0, it means a valid combination of fruits was found that satisfies the taste-to-calorie ratio \( k \) and has a non-zero total taste.
   - The program correctly prints the maximum total taste if such a combination exists; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic required to find the maximum taste of the chosen fruits while adhering to the specified ratio \( k \). It handles all the necessary steps as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the output is correct for all valid inputs within the given constraints. Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
