Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of possible sums of taste minus k times the calories, ensuring the condition is met. The program iterates through each fruit, updating the possible sums, and finally checks if a valid combination exists that results in a sum of 0, indicating the conditions are met. If such a combination exists, it prints the maximum possible sum of tastes; otherwise, it prints -1. This approach handles all the described scenarios and examples provided, making the program correct.
