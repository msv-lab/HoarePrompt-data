You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Dima, Inna and Seryozha have gathered in a room. That's right, someone's got to go. To cheer Seryozha up and inspire him to have a walk, Inna decided to cook something. 

Dima and Seryozha have n fruits in the fridge. Each fruit has two parameters: the taste and the number of calories. Inna decided to make a fruit salad, so she wants to take some fruits from the fridge for it. Inna follows a certain principle as she chooses the fruits: the total taste to the total calories ratio of the chosen fruits must equal k. In other words, <image> , where aj is the taste of the j-th chosen fruit and bj is its calories.

Inna hasn't chosen the fruits yet, she is thinking: what is the maximum taste of the chosen fruits if she strictly follows her principle? Help Inna solve this culinary problem — now the happiness of a young couple is in your hands!

Inna loves Dima very much so she wants to make the salad from at least one fruit.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the fruits' tastes. The third line of the input contains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 ≤ bi ≤ 100) — the fruits' calories. Fruit number i has taste ai and calories bi.

Output

If there is no way Inna can choose the fruits for the salad, print in the single line number -1. Otherwise, print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits.

Examples

Input

3 2
10 8 1
2 7 1


Output

18


Input

5 3
4 4 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2


Output

-1

Note

In the first test sample we can get the total taste of the fruits equal to 18 if we choose fruit number 1 and fruit number 2, then the total calories will equal 9. The condition <image> fulfills, that's exactly what Inna wants.

In the second test sample we cannot choose the fruits so as to follow Inna's principle.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The list a contains n positive integers each between 1 and 100, inclusive, representing the tastes of the fruits. The list b contains n positive integers each between 1 and 100, inclusive, representing the calories of the fruits.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    A = map(int, raw_input().split())
    B = map(int, raw_input().split())
    dp1 = defaultdict(lambda : 0, {(0): 0})
    pos = 0
    for (a, b) in zip(A, B):
        cur = a - b * k
        
        dp2 = dp1.copy()
        
        for x, y in dp1.iteritems():
            dp2[x + cur] = max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)
        
        dp1 = dp2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `B` is a list of `n` integers, `dp1` is a dictionary with keys as integers and values as integers, `pos` is 0, `dp1` is updated to reflect the maximum values obtained by iterating through `a` and `B` using the defined process.
    if (dp1[0] > 0) :
        print(dp1[0])
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `B` is a list of `n` integers, `dp1` is a dictionary with keys as integers and values as integers, `pos` is 0. If `dp1[0]` is greater than 0, the function reflects the maximum values obtained by iterating through `a` and `B` using the defined process, and does not print anything. Otherwise, `dp1` is updated to reflect the maximum values obtained by iterating through `a` and `B` using the defined process, and `-1` is printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
