Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. Specifically, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly find the maximum taste of the chosen fruits while adhering to the constraint that the ratio of the total taste to the total calories must equal \( k \).

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program does not meet the requirements:

1. **Incorrect State Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes `dp1` with the key `0` mapped to `0`, which is correct.
   - However, the program does not handle the scenario where no valid combination of fruits satisfies the ratio constraint.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The logic inside the for loop iterates over the fruits and updates the `dp` table to keep track of the maximum taste achievable for different states. However, the approach used here is incorrect because it does not properly account for the ratio constraint.
   - The update step `dp2[x + cur] = max(dp2[x + cur], y + a)` is incorrect because it assumes that simply subtracting `b * k` and adding `a` will maintain the required ratio. This is not true as it ignores the cumulative nature of the ratio constraint.

3. **Ratio Constraint Handling**:
   - The program should maintain a dynamic programming table where each state `(x, y)` represents a combination of taste `x` and calories `y`. It should ensure that the ratio \( \frac{x}{y} = k \) for each state.
   - The current implementation does not enforce this ratio constraint effectively. Instead, it attempts to maximize the taste directly without ensuring the ratio is maintained.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to use a more sophisticated dynamic programming approach where you explicitly maintain the ratio constraint. One way to achieve this is by using a knapsack-like approach where you maintain two-dimensional DP tables to keep track of the maximum taste for each possible taste-to-calorie ratio.

Here is a conceptual outline of how you could implement the correct solution:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(k, 0, -1):
            for l in range(i, -1, -1):
                if j * (A[i] - B[i] * k) >= dp[j][l]:
                    dp[j][i + 1] = max(dp[j][i + 1], dp[j][l] + A[i])
                else:
                    break
    
    # Find the maximum taste value
    max_taste = -1
    for j in range(1, k + 1):
        max_taste = max(max_taste, dp[j][n])
    
    print(max_taste if max_taste != -1 else -1)
```

This approach maintains the necessary ratio constraints and ensures that the maximum taste value is found while adhering to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the given program does not meet the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.
