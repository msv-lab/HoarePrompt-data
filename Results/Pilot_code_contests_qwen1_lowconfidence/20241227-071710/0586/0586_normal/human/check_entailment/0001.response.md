Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program seems to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution to find the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits while maintaining the required taste-to-calories ratio `k`. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the dynamic programming (DP) table `dp1` with a base case where the key is 0 and the value is 0.

2. **Iterate through Fruits**: For each fruit, the program calculates the difference between the fruit’s taste and `k` times its calories (`cur = a - b * k`).

3. **Update DP Table**: For each fruit, it updates the DP table `dp2` by considering the current fruit's contribution to the existing states. It checks if adding the current fruit to any existing state in `dp1` results in a better (higher taste) solution and updates `dp2` accordingly.

4. **Check Final State**: After processing all fruits, the program checks if there is any valid state in `dp1` where the total taste is greater than 0. If such a state exists, it prints the maximum taste; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach ensures that the maximum possible sum of the taste values of the chosen fruits is found while adhering to the required ratio. The program handles all the described cases correctly and does not miss any potential scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
