The function processes two lists, `A` and `B`, containing `n` positive integers each, and an integer `k`. It calculates the maximum sum of elements from list `A` such that the corresponding elements in list `B` do not exceed `k` when multiplied. This is achieved using dynamic programming stored in the dictionary `dp1`. After processing, the function prints the maximum sum if it is greater than 0; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `dp1[0]` is not updated properly or when the input lists `A` and `B` contain invalid values (though the code assumes valid inputs based on the given constraints).
