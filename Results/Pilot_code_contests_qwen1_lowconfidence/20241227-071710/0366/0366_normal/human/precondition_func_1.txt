n is an integer representing the number of characters (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), m is an integer representing the number of known relationships (0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000), e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains a list of tuples [v, c] for each adjacent vertex v and the relationship type c (0 for hate, 1 for love) of the edge from i to v, vis is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal, and mod is an integer representing the modulus value (1 000 000 007).
