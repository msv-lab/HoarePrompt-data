u is an integer such that 1 <= u <= n, representing a character in the anime. e is a list of adjacency lists, where e[u] is a list of tuples (v, c), indicating that there is a relationship between character u and character v, and c is a boolean value where True means they love each other and False means they hate each other. vis is a boolean list of length n, initially all set to False, representing the love/hate status assigned to each character recursively by the function.
