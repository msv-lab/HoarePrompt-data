#State of the program right berfore the function call: u is an integer such that 1 <= u <= n, representing a character in the anime. e is a list of adjacency lists, where e[u] is a list of tuples (v, c), indicating that there is a relationship between character u and character v, and c is a boolean value where True means they love each other and False means they hate each other. vis is a boolean list of length n, initially all set to False, representing the love/hate status assigned to each character recursively by the function.

            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sz` must be greater than 0; `v` is `e[u][i][0]`; `c` is `e[u][i][1]`; `vis[v]` is either `vis[u]` or the opposite of `vis[u]` depending on whether `c` equals `True` or not; `ok` remains unchanged throughout all iterations unless the loop terminates early due to a call to `func_1(v)` returning `False`. If the loop terminates early because `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]` becomes true for any iteration, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, after all iterations, `ok` retains the final value returned by `func_1(v)` if the loop completes without early termination.
    return ok
    #The program returns `ok`, which retains the final value returned by `func_1(v)` if the loop completes without early termination, or `False` if the loop terminates early because `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]` becomes true for any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `u`, a list of adjacency lists `e`, and a boolean list `vis`. It aims to assign a consistent love/hate status (`vis`) to each character based on their relationships (`e`). The function returns `False` in several specific cases (Cases 1-6), which are not detailed in the provided annotations but likely involve inconsistencies in the love/hate statuses. In Case 7, the function recursively assigns statuses to characters connected to `u` through the adjacency list `e`. If the assignments remain consistent throughout the recursion, the function returns `ok`, which is the final value returned by the last recursive call. If an inconsistency is found (specifically, when `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]`), the function returns `False`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `vis` contains the consistent love/hate statuses assigned to each character, or the program returns `False` if inconsistencies prevent consistent assignment.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod`. It reads in the number of characters (`n`) and the number of known relationships (`m`), followed by the adjacency list representation of a graph (`e`). It initializes a boolean list `vis` to track visited vertices and processes the graph by performing a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of connected components (`cnt`). For each connected component, it calculates the result (`ans`) as \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\). If no connected components are found (`cnt == 0`), the result is set to `0`. If a connected component is found, it multiplies `ans` by `2` for each vertex in the component and takes the result modulo `1,000,000,007`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes the input values are within specified bounds (3 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000). If these constraints are not met, the function behavior is undefined.
2. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values for `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `c`.
3. The function does not validate that the adjacency list `e` is correctly formatted or that it represents a valid graph structure.
4. The function does not explicitly check for cycles in the graph, which could lead to infinite recursion if not handled properly.
5. The function does not provide any error handling or feedback for unexpected input conditions or errors during execution.
