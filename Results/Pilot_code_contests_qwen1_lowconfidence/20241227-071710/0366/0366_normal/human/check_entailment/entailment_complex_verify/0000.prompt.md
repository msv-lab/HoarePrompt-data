You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are many anime that are about "love triangles": Alice loves Bob, and Charlie loves Bob as well, but Alice hates Charlie. You are thinking about an anime which has n characters. The characters are labeled from 1 to n. Every pair of two characters can either mutually love each other or mutually hate each other (there is no neutral state).

You hate love triangles (A-B are in love and B-C are in love, but A-C hate each other), and you also hate it when nobody is in love. So, considering any three characters, you will be happy if exactly one pair is in love (A and B love each other, and C hates both A and B), or if all three pairs are in love (A loves B, B loves C, C loves A).

You are given a list of m known relationships in the anime. You know for sure that certain pairs love each other, and certain pairs hate each other. You're wondering how many ways you can fill in the remaining relationships so you are happy with every triangle. Two ways are considered different if two characters are in love in one way but hate each other in the other. Print this count modulo 1 000 000 007.

Input

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).

The next m lines will contain the description of the known relationships. The i-th line will contain three integers ai, bi, ci. If ci is 1, then ai and bi are in love, otherwise, they hate each other (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, <image>).

Each pair of people will be described no more than once.

Output

Print a single integer equal to the number of ways to fill in the remaining pairs so that you are happy with every triangle modulo 1 000 000 007.

Note

In the first sample, the four ways are to: 

  * Make everyone love each other 
  * Make 1 and 2 love each other, and 3 hate 1 and 2 (symmetrically, we get 3 ways from this). 



In the second sample, the only possible solution is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key issues are:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edges**: The program uses a recursive function `func_1` to propagate the love/hate states across the graph. However, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly handle the conditions for being happy with every triangle. Specifically, it does not ensure that for every triplet of nodes, exactly one pair is in love and the other two pairs are in hate, or all three pairs are in love.

2. **Incorrect State Propagation**: The function `func_1` sets `vis[v]` to `vis[u]` or `-vis[u]` based on the relationship status, but it does not properly check and enforce the conditions for happiness. For instance, it does not ensure that if `c == 1` (love), `vis[v]` should be `vis[u]`, and if `c == 0` (hate), `vis[v]` should be `-vis[u]`.

3. **Incomplete Graph Traversal**: The program only checks for connected components using the `vis` array and calls `func_1` recursively for unvisited nodes. It does not ensure that the final configuration of love/hate states satisfies the conditions for all triangles within each component.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The program computes the result using modulo 1,000,000,007, but it does not correctly account for all possible valid configurations that satisfy the problem constraints.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly compute the number of ways to fill in the remaining relationships such that you are happy with every triangle. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
maxn = 100005
mod = 1000000007
e = [[] for i in range(maxn)]
vis = [False for i in range(maxn)]
func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: u is an integer such that 1 <= u <= n, representing a character in the anime. e is a list of adjacency lists, where e[u] is a list of tuples (v, c), indicating that there is a relationship between character u and character v, and c is a boolean value where True means they love each other and False means they hate each other. vis is a boolean list of length n, initially all set to False, representing the love/hate status assigned to each character recursively by the function.
def func_1(u):
    sz = len(e[u])
    ok = True
    for i in range(sz):
        v = e[u][i][0]
        
        c = e[u][i][1]
        
        if vis[v] == False:
            if c == True:
                vis[v] = vis[u]
            else:
                vis[v] = -vis[u]
            ok = func_1(v)
        
        if c == 1 and vis[v] != vis[u]:
            return False
        
        if c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sz` must be greater than 0; `v` is `e[u][i][0]`; `c` is `e[u][i][1]`; `vis[v]` is either `vis[u]` or the opposite of `vis[u]` depending on whether `c` equals `True` or not; `ok` remains unchanged throughout all iterations unless the loop terminates early due to a call to `func_1(v)` returning `False`. If the loop terminates early because `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]` becomes true for any iteration, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, after all iterations, `ok` retains the final value returned by `func_1(v)` if the loop completes without early termination.
    return ok
    #The program returns `ok`, which retains the final value returned by `func_1(v)` if the loop completes without early termination, or `False` if the loop terminates early because `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]` becomes true for any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `u`, a list of adjacency lists `e`, and a boolean list `vis`. It aims to assign a consistent love/hate status (`vis`) to each character based on their relationships (`e`). The function returns `False` in several specific cases (Cases 1-6), which are not detailed in the provided annotations but likely involve inconsistencies in the love/hate statuses. In Case 7, the function recursively assigns statuses to characters connected to `u` through the adjacency list `e`. If the assignments remain consistent throughout the recursion, the function returns `ok`, which is the final value returned by the last recursive call. If an inconsistency is found (specifically, when `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]`), the function returns `False`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `vis` contains the consistent love/hate statuses assigned to each character, or the program returns `False` if inconsistencies prevent consistent assignment.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of characters (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), m is an integer representing the number of known relationships (0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000), e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains a list of tuples [v, c] for each adjacent vertex v and the relationship type c (0 for hate, 1 for love) of the edge from i to v, vis is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal, and mod is an integer representing the modulus value (1 000 000 007).

    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod`. It reads in the number of characters (`n`) and the number of known relationships (`m`), followed by the adjacency list representation of a graph (`e`). It initializes a boolean list `vis` to track visited vertices and processes the graph by performing a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of connected components (`cnt`). For each connected component, it calculates the result (`ans`) as \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\). If no connected components are found (`cnt == 0`), the result is set to `0`. If a connected component is found, it multiplies `ans` by `2` for each vertex in the component and takes the result modulo `1,000,000,007`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes the input values are within specified bounds (3 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000). If these constraints are not met, the function behavior is undefined.
2. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values for `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `c`.
3. The function does not validate that the adjacency list `e` is correctly formatted or that it represents a valid graph structure.
4. The function does not explicitly check for cycles in the graph, which could lead to infinite recursion if not handled properly.
5. The function does not provide any error handling or feedback for unexpected input conditions or errors during execution.
