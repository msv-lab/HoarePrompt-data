You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are many anime that are about "love triangles": Alice loves Bob, and Charlie loves Bob as well, but Alice hates Charlie. You are thinking about an anime which has n characters. The characters are labeled from 1 to n. Every pair of two characters can either mutually love each other or mutually hate each other (there is no neutral state).

You hate love triangles (A-B are in love and B-C are in love, but A-C hate each other), and you also hate it when nobody is in love. So, considering any three characters, you will be happy if exactly one pair is in love (A and B love each other, and C hates both A and B), or if all three pairs are in love (A loves B, B loves C, C loves A).

You are given a list of m known relationships in the anime. You know for sure that certain pairs love each other, and certain pairs hate each other. You're wondering how many ways you can fill in the remaining relationships so you are happy with every triangle. Two ways are considered different if two characters are in love in one way but hate each other in the other. Print this count modulo 1 000 000 007.

Input

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).

The next m lines will contain the description of the known relationships. The i-th line will contain three integers ai, bi, ci. If ci is 1, then ai and bi are in love, otherwise, they hate each other (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, <image>).

Each pair of people will be described no more than once.

Output

Print a single integer equal to the number of ways to fill in the remaining pairs so that you are happy with every triangle modulo 1 000 000 007.

Note

In the first sample, the four ways are to: 

  * Make everyone love each other 
  * Make 1 and 2 love each other, and 3 hate 1 and 2 (symmetrically, we get 3 ways from this). 



In the second sample, the only possible solution is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(u):
    sz = len(e[u])
    ok = True
    for i in range(sz):
        v = e[u][i][0]
        c = e[u][i][1]
        if vis[v] == False:
            if c == True:
                vis[v] = vis[u]
            else:
                vis[v] = -vis[u]
            ok = func_1(v)
        if c == 1 and vis[v] != vis[u]:
            return False
        if c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]:
            return False
    return ok

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(m):
        (u, v, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        u -= 1
        v -= 1
        e[u].append([v, c])
        e[v].append([u, c])
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if vis[i] == False:
            vis[i] = True
            cnt += 1
            if func_1(i) == False:
                cnt = 0
                break
    ans = 1
    if cnt == 0:
        ans = 0
    for i in (1, cnt):
        ans *= 2
        ans %= mod
    print(ans)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
