Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and `m`, and then processes the `m` relationships. Each relationship is stored in the adjacency list `e` as a tuple `[v, c]` where `v` is the adjacent vertex and `c` is the relationship type (0 for hate, 1 for love).

2. **Graph Traversal**: The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach through the `func_1` function to assign the love/hate statuses (`vis`) for each character based on the initial relationships provided. It ensures that for any three characters `A`, `B`, and `C`:
   - If `A` and `B` are in love (`c == 1`), then `C` should either hate both (`vis[C] != vis[A]`) or love both (`vis[C] == vis[A]`).
   - If `A` and `B` hate each other (`c == 0`), then `C` should either love both (`vis[C] == -vis[A]`) or hate both (`vis[C] != -vis[A]`).

3. **Validation**: After assigning initial statuses using `func_1`, the program checks if the assignment is valid for all triangles. If at any point the conditions fail, it sets `cnt` to 0 and breaks out of the loop. If all checks pass, it proceeds to calculate the number of valid configurations.

4. **Configuration Counting**: For each connected component identified by the DFS, the program calculates the number of valid configurations using the formula \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\), where `cnt` is the number of characters in the connected component. This ensures that all remaining pairs can be filled in to satisfy the given conditions.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The program correctly handles the large number of possible configurations by taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the program accurately follows the problem description by ensuring that all relationships are respected and calculating the valid configurations accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.
