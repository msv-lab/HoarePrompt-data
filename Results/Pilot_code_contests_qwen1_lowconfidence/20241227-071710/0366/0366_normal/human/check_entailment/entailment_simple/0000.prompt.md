You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are many anime that are about "love triangles": Alice loves Bob, and Charlie loves Bob as well, but Alice hates Charlie. You are thinking about an anime which has n characters. The characters are labeled from 1 to n. Every pair of two characters can either mutually love each other or mutually hate each other (there is no neutral state).

You hate love triangles (A-B are in love and B-C are in love, but A-C hate each other), and you also hate it when nobody is in love. So, considering any three characters, you will be happy if exactly one pair is in love (A and B love each other, and C hates both A and B), or if all three pairs are in love (A loves B, B loves C, C loves A).

You are given a list of m known relationships in the anime. You know for sure that certain pairs love each other, and certain pairs hate each other. You're wondering how many ways you can fill in the remaining relationships so you are happy with every triangle. Two ways are considered different if two characters are in love in one way but hate each other in the other. Print this count modulo 1 000 000 007.

Input

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).

The next m lines will contain the description of the known relationships. The i-th line will contain three integers ai, bi, ci. If ci is 1, then ai and bi are in love, otherwise, they hate each other (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, <image>).

Each pair of people will be described no more than once.

Output

Print a single integer equal to the number of ways to fill in the remaining pairs so that you are happy with every triangle modulo 1 000 000 007.

Note

In the first sample, the four ways are to: 

  * Make everyone love each other 
  * Make 1 and 2 love each other, and 3 hate 1 and 2 (symmetrically, we get 3 ways from this). 



In the second sample, the only possible solution is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
maxn = 100005
mod = 1000000007
e = [[] for i in range(maxn)]
vis = [False for i in range(maxn)]
func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: u is an integer such that 1 <= u <= n, representing a character in the anime. e is a list of adjacency lists, where e[u] is a list of tuples (v, c), indicating that there is a relationship between character u and character v, and c is a boolean value where True means they love each other and False means they hate each other. vis is a boolean list of length n, initially all set to False, representing the love/hate status assigned to each character recursively by the function.
def func_1(u):
    sz = len(e[u])
    ok = True
    for i in range(sz):
        v = e[u][i][0]
        
        c = e[u][i][1]
        
        if vis[v] == False:
            if c == True:
                vis[v] = vis[u]
            else:
                vis[v] = -vis[u]
            ok = func_1(v)
        
        if c == 1 and vis[v] != vis[u]:
            return False
        
        if c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sz` must be greater than 0; `v` is `e[u][i][0]`; `c` is `e[u][i][1]`; `vis[v]` is either `vis[u]` or the opposite of `vis[u]` depending on whether `c` equals `True` or not; `ok` remains unchanged throughout all iterations unless the loop terminates early due to a call to `func_1(v)` returning `False`. If the loop terminates early because `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]` becomes true for any iteration, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, after all iterations, `ok` retains the final value returned by `func_1(v)` if the loop completes without early termination.
    return ok
    #The program returns `ok`, which retains the final value returned by `func_1(v)` if the loop completes without early termination, or `False` if the loop terminates early because `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]` becomes true for any iteration.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of characters (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), m is an integer representing the number of known relationships (0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000), e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains a list of tuples [v, c] for each adjacent vertex v and the relationship type c (0 for hate, 1 for love) of the edge from i to v, vis is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal, and mod is an integer representing the modulus value (1 000 000 007).
def func_2():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        e[u].append([v, c])

            if func_1(i) == False:

        ans = 0

If `cnt == 0` is true, then `m` is `n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `m` is the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`; `cnt` is `0`; `vis[i]` is `False` for the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `u`, `v`, and `c` are the integer values from the input minus 1 and for each iteration, respectively; `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`; `ans` is `0`. If `cnt == 0` is false, then the original states of `m`, `i`, `cnt`, `vis[i]`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `e`, and `ans` are preserved.
    for i in (1, cnt):
        ans *= 2
        
        ans %= mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\), `cnt` is the number of times the loop has executed.
    print(ans)


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
