Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly ensure that the love/hate statuses assigned to each character are consistent for all triangles. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Triangles**: The code checks for inconsistencies in the love/hate statuses but does not ensure that for every triangle, exactly one pair is in love and the other pair hates each other or that all three pairs are in love. This is crucial for the problem's requirements.

2. **Edge Cases and Validation**: The code does not explicitly validate the graph for cycles or inconsistencies beyond the simple checks performed in `func_1`. For instance, if a cycle exists where the statuses cannot be consistently assigned, the function will return `False`, but this does not address all possible invalid configurations.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`**: While `func_1` attempts to assign statuses, it does not fully guarantee that the resulting configuration satisfies the problem's conditions. The function only checks for immediate conflicts but does not ensure the overall consistency for all triangles.

To illustrate, consider the following scenario:
- Let's say we have 4 characters: A, B, C, D.
- Known relationships: (A, B, 1) (B, C, 1) (C, D, 0) (D, A, 0).

The code would incorrectly assign statuses without ensuring that the love/hate conditions for all triangles are met. Specifically, it might assign statuses such that (A, B) love each other, (B, C) love each other, (C, D) hate each other, and (D, A) hate each other, which does not satisfy the problem's conditions.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
