You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are many anime that are about "love triangles": Alice loves Bob, and Charlie loves Bob as well, but Alice hates Charlie. You are thinking about an anime which has n characters. The characters are labeled from 1 to n. Every pair of two characters can either mutually love each other or mutually hate each other (there is no neutral state).

You hate love triangles (A-B are in love and B-C are in love, but A-C hate each other), and you also hate it when nobody is in love. So, considering any three characters, you will be happy if exactly one pair is in love (A and B love each other, and C hates both A and B), or if all three pairs are in love (A loves B, B loves C, C loves A).

You are given a list of m known relationships in the anime. You know for sure that certain pairs love each other, and certain pairs hate each other. You're wondering how many ways you can fill in the remaining relationships so you are happy with every triangle. Two ways are considered different if two characters are in love in one way but hate each other in the other. Print this count modulo 1 000 000 007.

Input

The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).

The next m lines will contain the description of the known relationships. The i-th line will contain three integers ai, bi, ci. If ci is 1, then ai and bi are in love, otherwise, they hate each other (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, <image>).

Each pair of people will be described no more than once.

Output

Print a single integer equal to the number of ways to fill in the remaining pairs so that you are happy with every triangle modulo 1 000 000 007.

Note

In the first sample, the four ways are to: 

  * Make everyone love each other 
  * Make 1 and 2 love each other, and 3 hate 1 and 2 (symmetrically, we get 3 ways from this). 



In the second sample, the only possible solution is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other.
Annotated Functions:
maxn = 100005
mod = 1000000007
e = [[] for i in range(maxn)]
vis = [False for i in range(maxn)]
func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: u is an integer such that 1 <= u <= n, representing a character in the anime. e is a list of adjacency lists, where e[u] is a list of tuples (v, c), indicating that there is a relationship between character u and character v, and c is a boolean value where True means they love each other and False means they hate each other. vis is a boolean list of length n, initially all set to False, representing the love/hate status assigned to each character recursively by the function.
def func_1(u):
    sz = len(e[u])
    ok = True
    for i in range(sz):
        v = e[u][i][0]
        
        c = e[u][i][1]
        
        if vis[v] == False:
            if c == True:
                vis[v] = vis[u]
            else:
                vis[v] = -vis[u]
            ok = func_1(v)
        
        if c == 1 and vis[v] != vis[u]:
            return False
        
        if c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sz` must be greater than 0; `v` is `e[u][i][0]`; `c` is `e[u][i][1]`; `vis[v]` is either `vis[u]` or the opposite of `vis[u]` depending on whether `c` equals `True` or not; `ok` remains unchanged throughout all iterations unless the loop terminates early due to a call to `func_1(v)` returning `False`. If the loop terminates early because `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]` becomes true for any iteration, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, after all iterations, `ok` retains the final value returned by `func_1(v)` if the loop completes without early termination.
    return ok
    #The program returns `ok`, which retains the final value returned by `func_1(v)` if the loop completes without early termination, or `False` if the loop terminates early because `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]` becomes true for any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `u`, a list of adjacency lists `e`, and a boolean list `vis`. It aims to assign a consistent love/hate status (`vis`) to each character based on their relationships (`e`). The function returns `False` in several specific cases (Cases 1-6), which are not detailed in the provided annotations but likely involve inconsistencies in the love/hate statuses. In Case 7, the function recursively assigns statuses to characters connected to `u` through the adjacency list `e`. If the assignments remain consistent throughout the recursion, the function returns `ok`, which is the final value returned by the last recursive call. If an inconsistency is found (specifically, when `c == 0 and vis[v] != -vis[u]`), the function returns `False`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `vis` contains the consistent love/hate statuses assigned to each character, or the program returns `False` if inconsistencies prevent consistent assignment.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of characters (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), m is an integer representing the number of known relationships (0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000), e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains a list of tuples [v, c] for each adjacent vertex v and the relationship type c (0 for hate, 1 for love) of the edge from i to v, vis is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal, and mod is an integer representing the modulus value (1 000 000 007).
def func_2():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())

                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m` is `n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `m` is the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`; `cnt` is the number of vertices marked as `True` by `vis` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `vis[i]` is `True` for the vertices marked as `True` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `vis[i]` is `False` for the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration; `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`.

        ans = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m`, `i`, `cnt`, `vis[i]`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `e`, and `ans` retain their states depending on the condition `cnt == 0`. If `cnt == 0` is true, then `m` is `n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `m` is the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`; `cnt` is `0`; `vis[i]` is `False` for the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `u`, `v`, and `c` are the integer values from the input minus 1 and for each iteration, respectively; `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`; `ans` is `0`. If `cnt == 0` is false, then the original states of `m`, `i`, `cnt`, `vis[i]`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `e`, and `ans` are preserved.
    for i in (1, cnt):
        ans *= 2
        
        ans %= mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\), `cnt` is the number of times the loop has executed.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod`. It reads in the number of characters (`n`) and the number of known relationships (`m`), followed by the adjacency list representation of a graph (`e`). It initializes a boolean list `vis` to track visited vertices and processes the graph by performing a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of connected components (`cnt`). For each connected component, it calculates the result (`ans`) as \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\). If no connected components are found (`cnt == 0`), the result is set to `0`. If a connected component is found, it multiplies `ans` by `2` for each vertex in the component and takes the result modulo `1,000,000,007`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes the input values are within specified bounds (3 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000). If these constraints are not met, the function behavior is undefined.
2. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values for `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `c`.
3. The function does not validate that the adjacency list `e` is correctly formatted or that it represents a valid graph structure.
4. The function does not explicitly check for cycles in the graph, which could lead to infinite recursion if not handled properly.
5. The function does not provide any error handling or feedback for unexpected input conditions or errors during execution.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
