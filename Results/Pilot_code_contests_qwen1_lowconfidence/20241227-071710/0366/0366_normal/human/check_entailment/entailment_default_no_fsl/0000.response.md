Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code does not handle cases where the graph is not fully connected or contains disconnected components. The function `func_2` performs a DFS to count the number of connected components but does not account for scenarios where these components may not satisfy the required conditions for the problem.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 0
4 1 0
```

In this case, the graph consists of two separate connected components: {1, 2} and {3, 4}. According to the problem description, for each connected component, the program should ensure that the conditions for happiness are met. However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not verify whether the remaining edges within each component can be filled to meet the requirements. As a result, the program might incorrectly report a valid solution when, in fact, it is not possible to satisfy the conditions for all components.

To illustrate, in the given example, the only valid configuration is to make 1 and 3 love each other and 2 and 4 hate each other. However, the provided code does not enforce this condition and instead returns 1 as the answer, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to a verdict of **False**.
