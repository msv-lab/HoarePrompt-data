The code sets `vis[i]` to `True`. This means that the value of `vis[i]` is now `True`, and the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is \( m + 1 \), `i` is \( m + 2 \), `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex \( j \) (0 â‰¤ \( j \) < \( n \)), \( e[j] \) contains all edges connected to vertex \( j \) with their respective costs \( c \) modulo \( 1 000 000 007 \), `cnt` is incremented by 1, `vis[i]` is `True`**
