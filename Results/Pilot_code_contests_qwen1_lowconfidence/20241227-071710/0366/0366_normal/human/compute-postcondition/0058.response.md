Output State: **`ans` is \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\), `cnt` is the number of times the loop has executed.** 

Explanation:
- The loop starts with `cnt == 0` and `ans == 0`.
- For each iteration of the loop, `ans` is updated by multiplying it by 2 and then taking the result modulo `mod`.
- After each iteration, `cnt` increments by 1.
- If the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt` will be equal to the number of times the loop has executed, and `ans` will be \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\).
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `cnt == 0` remains true), then `ans` remains 0, and `cnt` remains 0.
