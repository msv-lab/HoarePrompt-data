You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of characters (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), m is an integer representing the number of known relationships (0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000), e is a list of adjacency lists where e[i] contains a list of tuples [v, c] for each adjacent vertex v and the relationship type c (0 for hate, 1 for love) of the edge from i to v, vis is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal, and mod is an integer representing the modulus value (1 000 000 007).
def func_2():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        e[u].append([v, c])
        
        e[v].append([u, c])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 0, `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`.
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if vis[i] == False:
            vis[i] = True
            cnt += 1
            if func_1(i) == False:
                cnt = 0
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m` is `n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `m` is the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`; `cnt` is the number of vertices marked as `True` by `vis` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `vis[i]` is `True` for the vertices marked as `True` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `vis[i]` is `False` for the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration; `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`.
    ans = 1
    if (cnt == 0) :
        ans = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m`, `i`, `cnt`, `vis[i]`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `e`, and `ans` retain their states depending on the condition `cnt == 0`. If `cnt == 0` is true, then `m` is `n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `m` is the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`; `cnt` is `0`; `vis[i]` is `False` for the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `u`, `v`, and `c` are the integer values from the input minus 1 and for each iteration, respectively; `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`; `ans` is `0`. If `cnt == 0` is false, then the original states of `m`, `i`, `cnt`, `vis[i]`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `e`, and `ans` are preserved.
    for i in (1, cnt):
        ans *= 2
        
        ans %= mod
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\), `cnt` is the number of times the loop has executed.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod` and performs operations based on these parameters, typically involving graph traversal and relationships.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
