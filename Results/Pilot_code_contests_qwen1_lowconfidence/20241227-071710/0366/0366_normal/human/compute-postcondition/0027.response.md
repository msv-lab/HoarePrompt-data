The `break` statement does not modify any variables directly. It only serves to exit the loop or the most internal if statement it is inside. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`m` must be less than `n`, `i` is `m`, `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 â‰¤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`, `cnt` is 0, `vis[i]` is `True`, and the function `func_1(i)` returns `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
