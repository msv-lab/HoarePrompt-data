`u` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `u` is 3, so after decrementing, `u` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `u` is 2, `v` is 2, `c` is 5, `e[3]` includes the elements `[2, 5]` and `[1, 5]`, `e[2]` includes the elements `[2, 5]` and `[1, 5]`, `e[1]` includes the element `[3, 5]`.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `u` is 2, `v` is 2, `c` is 5, `e[3]` includes the elements `[2, 5]` and `[1, 5]`, `e[2]` includes the elements `[2, 5]` and `[1, 5]`, `e[1]` includes the element `[3, 5]`**
