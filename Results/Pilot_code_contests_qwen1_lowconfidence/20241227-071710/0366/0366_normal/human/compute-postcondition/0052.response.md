Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `ans` is `ans * 2 % mod`
   - `cnt` must be at least 1

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in (1, cnt):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `cnt` inclusive.
   - This means the loop will run exactly `cnt` times.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop will run exactly `cnt` times, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be at least 2 because it starts from 1 and goes up to `cnt`.

5. **Updating the State**:
   - `ans` remains `ans * 2 % mod`.
   - `cnt` must now be at least 2 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the updated state should be:

State: **`ans` is `ans * 2 % mod`, `cnt` must be at least 2**
