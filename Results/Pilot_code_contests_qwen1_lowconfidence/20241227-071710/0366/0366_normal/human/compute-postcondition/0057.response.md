The code `ans %= mod` updates `ans` to be the remainder of `ans` divided by `mod`. Given the initial state, `ans` is already defined as the remainder of `(ans * 4 % mod) * 2 % mod`. This means `ans` is already in the range from 0 to `mod-1` (inclusive). The operation `ans %= mod` does not change the value of `ans` since it is already within the required range.

The output state remains the same as the initial state because the operation does not alter the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is the remainder of `(ans * 4 % mod) * 2 % mod`, `cnt` must be at least 3**
