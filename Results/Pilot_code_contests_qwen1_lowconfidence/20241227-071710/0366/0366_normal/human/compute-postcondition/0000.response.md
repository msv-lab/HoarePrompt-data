The code snippet reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the standard input and splits them using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from the input, but the original value of `n` (as an integer representing the number of characters) and `m` (as an integer representing the number of known relationships) are replaced by these new values.

The other variables (`e`, `vis`, and `mod`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the new integer value from the input, `m` is assigned the new integer value from the input, 0 ≤ `m` ≤ 100 000, `e` is a list of adjacency lists, `vis` is a boolean list of length `n`, and `mod` is an integer representing the modulus value 1 000 000 007.**
