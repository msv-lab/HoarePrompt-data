`vis[i]` is set to `True`. The value of `i` is unchanged, and the states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be less than `n`, `i` is `m`, `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`, `cnt` is 0, and `vis[i]` is `True`.
