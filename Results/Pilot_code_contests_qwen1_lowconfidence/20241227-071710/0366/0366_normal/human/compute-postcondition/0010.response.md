`v` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `v` is the integer value from the input. After decrementing, the new value of `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `m` must be greater than 0; `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1; `v` is the integer value from the input minus 2; `c` is the integer value from the input; `e[v]` now includes the element `[u - 1, c]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` must be greater than 0; `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1; `v` is the integer value from the input minus 2; `c` is the integer value from the input; `e[v]` now includes the element `[u - 1, c]`**
