The code `ans *= 2` multiplies the current value of `ans` by 2 and assigns the result back to `ans`. The initial state is given as `ans` is `ans * 2 % mod`, which implies that `ans` is already in a form where it has been previously calculated using modulo operation with `mod`.

Since `ans` is already in the form of `ans * 2 % mod`, multiplying it by 2 again and taking modulo `mod` will result in the same expression but updated.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans * 2 * 2 % mod`, `cnt` must be at least 2**
