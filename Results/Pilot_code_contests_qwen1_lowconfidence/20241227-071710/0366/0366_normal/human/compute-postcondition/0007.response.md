Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `u` is its original value before decrementing by 1
   - `v` is its original value before decrementing by 1
   - `e[v]` now includes the element `[u, c]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in `range(m)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

3. **Increment of `i`:**
   Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`. Since `i` is incremented from 0 to 1, `i` will be 1. Therefore, the condition `i < m` must still hold true.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `m` must still be greater than 0 (as it was initially).
   - `u` remains unchanged as it is its original value before decrementing by 1.
   - `v` remains unchanged as it is its original value before decrementing by 1.
   - `e[v]` now includes the element `[u, c]` after the first iteration.

Based on these points, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `u` is its original value before decrementing by 1, `v` is its original value before decrementing by 1, `e[v]` now includes the element `[u, c]`**
