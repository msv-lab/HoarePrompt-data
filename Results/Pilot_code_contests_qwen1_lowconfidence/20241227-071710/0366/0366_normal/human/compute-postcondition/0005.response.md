The code snippet `e[u].append([v, c])` impacts the list `e[u]` by appending a new element `[v, c]` to it. However, the initial values of `u` and `v` are given as `u` is `u - 1` and `v` is `v - 1`. Since these are not specified as concrete values but rather as expressions, we will keep them in this form.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `u` is `u - 1`
- `v` is `v - 1`

After the code execution:
- `e[u]` will have a new element appended to it, which is `[v, c]`.
- The other variables `i`, `m`, `u`, and `v` retain their respective forms as expressions.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `m` must be greater than 0; `u` is `u - 1`; `v` is `v - 1`; `e[u]` has a new element `[v, c]` appended to it.**
