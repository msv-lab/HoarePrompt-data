The code `u, v, c = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `c`. The previous values of `i` and `m` are not affected.

Since the initial state is that `i` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 0, the updated state includes the new assignments for `u`, `v`, and `c`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `u` is an integer input, `v` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input**
