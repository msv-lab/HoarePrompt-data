Postcondition: ***`m` is \( m + 1 \), `i` is \( m + 2 \), `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex \( j \) (0 â‰¤ \( j \) < \( n \)), \( e[j] \) contains all edges connected to vertex \( j \) with their respective costs \( c \) modulo \( 1 000 000 007 \), `cnt` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 0, `vis[i]` is `True`. If `func_1(i)` returns `False`, `cnt` is reset to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.***
