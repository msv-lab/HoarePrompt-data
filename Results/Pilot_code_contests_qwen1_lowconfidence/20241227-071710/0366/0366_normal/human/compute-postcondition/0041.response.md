The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. In this case, there is no loop or conditional statement present in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.

Output State: **`m` is \( m + 1 \), `i` is \( m + 2 \), `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex \( j \) (0 â‰¤ \( j \) < \( n \)), \( e[j] \) contains all edges connected to vertex \( j \) with their respective costs \( c \) modulo \( 1 000 000 007 \), `cnt` is 0, `vis[i]` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
