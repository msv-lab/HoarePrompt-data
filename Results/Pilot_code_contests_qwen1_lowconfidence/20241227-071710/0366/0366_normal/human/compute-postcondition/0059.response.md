The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans` but does not change the value of `ans` itself. The variables `cnt` and `mod` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\), `cnt` is the number of times the loop has executed.**
