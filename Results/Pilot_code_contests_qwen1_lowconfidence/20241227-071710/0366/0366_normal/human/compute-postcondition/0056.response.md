`ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by 2. The original value of `ans` is the remainder of `ans * 4 % mod`. Since `ans` is updated to `ans * 2`, the new value of `ans` will be `(ans * 4 % mod) * 2 % mod`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the remainder of `(ans * 4 % mod) * 2 % mod`, `cnt` must be at least 3.

Output State: **`ans` is the remainder of `(ans * 4 % mod) * 2 % mod`, `cnt` must be at least 3**
