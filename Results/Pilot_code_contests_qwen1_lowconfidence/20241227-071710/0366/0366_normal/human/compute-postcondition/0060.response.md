The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: An integer representing the number of characters (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000).
- `m`: An integer representing the number of known relationships (0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).
- `e`: A list of adjacency lists where `e[i]` contains a list of tuples `[v, c]` for each adjacent vertex `v` and the relationship type `c` (0 for hate, 1 for love) of the edge from `i` to `v`.
- `vis`: A boolean list of length `n` indicating whether each character has been visited during the graph traversal.
- `mod`: An integer representing the modulus value (1 000 000 007).

The function returns a value based on the given conditions but the specific output is not provided directly in the question. However, based on typical problem structures involving graph traversal and relationships, it often returns a count or a boolean indicating a specific condition met during the traversal.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod` and perform some operation based on these parameters, likely involving graph traversal and counting or checking relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod` and performs operations based on these parameters, typically involving graph traversal and relationships.**
