The code `ans %= mod` takes the current value of `ans` and updates it to be `ans % mod`. This means `ans` is updated to its remainder when divided by `mod`.

Given the initial state `ans` is `ans * 2 * 2 % mod`, the value of `ans` before this operation is already in the form of `ans * 4 % mod`. However, since the assignment `ans %= mod` directly modifies `ans` to be its remainder when divided by `mod`, the value of `ans` post-execution is simply the remainder of `ans * 4 % mod` divided by `mod`.

Thus, the output state is: `ans` is the remainder of `ans * 4 % mod` when divided by `mod`, `cnt` must be at least 2.

Output State: **`ans` is the remainder of `ans * 4 % mod` when divided by `mod`, `cnt` must be at least 2**
