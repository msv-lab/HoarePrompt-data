Postcondition: **`m`, `i`, `cnt`, `vis[i]`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `e`, and `ans` retain their states depending on the condition `cnt == 0`. If `cnt == 0` is true, then `m` is `n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `m` is the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`; `cnt` is `0`; `vis[i]` is `False` for the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `u`, `v`, and `c` are the integer values from the input minus 1 and for each iteration, respectively; `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 â‰¤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`; `ans` is `0`. If `cnt == 0` is false, then the original states of `m`, `i`, `cnt`, `vis[i]`, `u`, `v`, `c`, `e`, and `ans` are preserved.**
