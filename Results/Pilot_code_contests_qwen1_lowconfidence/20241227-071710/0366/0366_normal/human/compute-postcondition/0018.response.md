`e[v]` is appended with a new list `[u, c]`. Given the initial state, `v` is 1, `u` is 2, and `c` is 5. So, `e[1]` will be updated to include `[2, 5]`.

The updated `e[1]` will be `[3, 5]` (initial value) + `[2, 5]` (newly appended).

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2; `m` must be greater than 0; `u` is 2; `v` is 1; `c` is 5; `e[1]` is `[3, 5, 2, 5]`; `e[2]` is `[[2, 5], [1, 5], [1, 5]]`; `e[3]` is `[2, 5]` and `[1, 5]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `m` must be greater than 0; `u` is 2; `v` is 1; `c` is 5; `e[1]` is `[3, 5, 2, 5]`; `e[2]` is `[[2, 5], [1, 5], [1, 5]]`; `e[3]` is `[2, 5]` and `[1, 5]`**
