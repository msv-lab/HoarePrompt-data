Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State Recap:
- `i` is `m`, where `m` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration.
- `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration.
- `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration.
- `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `vis` is an array of booleans initialized to `False` for all indices.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if vis[i] == False:
        vis[i] = True
        cnt += 1
        if func_1(i) == False:
            cnt = 0
            break
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `i` starts at `m`.
   - `vis[i]` is checked and potentially set to `True`.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1.
   - If `func_1(i)` returns `False`, `cnt` resets to 0 and the loop breaks.

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - Each iteration increments `i` by 1.
   - `vis[i]` is checked. If it is `False`, it is set to `True`.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1.
   - If `func_1(i)` returns `False`, `cnt` resets to 0 and the loop breaks.

3. **Final State Determination:**
   - The loop continues until `i` reaches `n` or `func_1(i)` returns `False` for some `i`.
   - If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be `n`, `cnt` will be the number of vertices marked as `True` by `vis`, and `vis[i]` will be `True` for those vertices.
   - If the loop breaks, `cnt` will be reset to 0.

### Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `m` will be `n - 1`, `i` will be `n`, `cnt` will be the number of vertices marked as `True` by `vis`, and `vis[i]` will be `True` for those vertices.
- If the loop breaks due to `func_1(i)` returning `False` for some `i`, `m` will be the last value of `i` that was less than `n`, `i` will be `m + 1`, `cnt` will be 0, and `vis[i]` will be `False`.

### Final Output State:
**Output State:**
- `m` is `n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `m` is the last value of `i` that was less than `n`.
- `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`.
- `cnt` is the number of vertices marked as `True` by `vis` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
- `vis[i]` is `True` for the vertices marked as `True` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `vis[i]` is `False` for the last value of `i` that was less than `n`.
- `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration.
- `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration.
- `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration.
- `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`.

**Output State:**
**Output State: **`m` is `n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `m` is the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`; `cnt` is the number of vertices marked as `True` by `vis` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `vis[i]` is `True` for the vertices marked as `True` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise `vis[i]` is `False` for the last value of `i` that was less than `n`; `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration; `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 ≤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`.**
