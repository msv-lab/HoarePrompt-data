`u`, `v`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The values of `i` and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1; `m` must be greater than 0; `u` is the integer value from the input; `v` is the integer value from the input; `c` is the integer value from the input; `e[v]` now includes the element `[u, c]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` must be greater than 0; `u` is the integer value from the input; `v` is the integer value from the input; `c` is the integer value from the input; `e[v]` now includes the element `[u, c]`**
