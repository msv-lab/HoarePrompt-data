Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1
   - `v` is the integer value from the input minus 2
   - `c` is the integer value from the input
   - `e[u]` includes the elements `[u - 1, c]` and `[v, c]`
   - `e[v]` includes the element `[u, c]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must become 2.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will increase by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `m` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **List and Element States:**
   - The lists `e[u]` and `e[v]` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are specified for these lists.
   - Therefore, `e[u]` still includes the elements `[u - 1, c]` and `[v, c]`.
   - `e[v]` still includes the element `[u, c]`.

Given this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` must be 2.
- `m` must still be greater than 0.
- `u`, `v`, `c`, `e[u]`, and `e[v]` remain the same.

Thus, the updated state is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1, `v` is the integer value from the input minus 2, `c` is the integer value from the input, `e[u]` includes the elements `[u - 1, c]` and `[v, c]`, `e[v]` includes the element `[u, c]`**
