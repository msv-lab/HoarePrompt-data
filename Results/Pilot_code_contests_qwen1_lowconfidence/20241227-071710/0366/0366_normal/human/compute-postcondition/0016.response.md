`v` is decremented by 1. Initially, `v` is 2, so after the operation, `v` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `u` is 2, `v` is 1, `c` is 5, `e[3]` includes the elements `[2, 5]` and `[1, 5]`, `e[2]` includes the elements `[2, 5]` and `[1, 5]`, `e[1]` includes the element `[3, 5]`**
