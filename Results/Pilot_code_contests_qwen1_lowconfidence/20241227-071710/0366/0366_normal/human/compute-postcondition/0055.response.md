According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must be at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is updated as the remainder of `ans * 4 % mod`, and `cnt` must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be at least 3, because `i` starts from 1 and iterates up to `cnt`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`ans` is the remainder of `ans * 4 % mod`, `cnt` must be at least 3**
