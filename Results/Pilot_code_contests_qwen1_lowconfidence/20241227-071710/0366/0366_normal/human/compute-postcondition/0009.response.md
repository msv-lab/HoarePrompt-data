`u` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `u` to `u - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `m` must be greater than 0; `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1; `v` is the integer value from the input; `c` is the integer value from the input; `e[v]` now includes the element `[u - 1, c]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` must be greater than 0; `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1; `v` is the integer value from the input; `c` is the integer value from the input; `e[v]` now includes the element `[u - 1, c]`**
