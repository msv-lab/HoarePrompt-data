The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most nested loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block before the `break`, the only affected thing is that the program will exit the current context, which means it will not continue to execute any subsequent code. However, the values of the variables will remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is \( m + 1 \)
- `i` is \( m + 1 \)
- `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration
- `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration
- `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration
- `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex \( j \) (0 ≤ \( j \) < \( n \)), \( e[j] \) contains all edges connected to vertex \( j \) with their respective costs \( c \) modulo \( 1 000 000 007 \)
- `cnt` is 0
- `vis[i]` is `True`

Since the `break` statement does not affect these variables, they retain their original values.

Output State: **`m` is \( m + 1 \); `i` is \( m + 1 \); `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration; `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex \( j \) (0 ≤ \( j \) < \( n \)), \( e[j] \) contains all edges connected to vertex \( j \) with their respective costs \( c \) modulo \( 1 000 000 007 \); `cnt` is 0; `vis[i]` is `True`.**
