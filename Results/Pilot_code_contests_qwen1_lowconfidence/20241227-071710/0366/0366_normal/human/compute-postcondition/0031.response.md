The code sets `vis[i]` to `True`. This changes the value of `vis[i]` but does not affect the values of the other variables. The other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`m` is \( m + 1 \); `i` is \( m + 1 \); `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration; `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration; `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex \( j \) (0 â‰¤ \( j \) < \( n \)), \( e[j] \) contains all edges connected to vertex \( j \) with their respective costs \( c \) modulo \( 1 000 000 007 \); `cnt` is incremented by 1; `vis[i]` is `True`.**
