`cnt` is incremented by 1, which means `cnt` now holds the new value of its previous value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`m` must be less than `n`, `i` is `m`, `u` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `v` is the integer value from the input minus 1 for each iteration, `c` is the integer value from the input for each iteration, `e` is a list of adjacency lists where for each vertex `j` (0 â‰¤ `j` < `n`), `e[j]` contains all edges connected to vertex `j` with their respective costs `c` modulo `1 000 000 007`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and `vis[i]` is `True`.**
