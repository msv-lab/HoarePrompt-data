`u` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `u` is an integer input, so after decrementing by 1, `u` becomes `u - 1`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `m`, `v`, and `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input**
