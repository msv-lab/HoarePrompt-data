The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `e`, `vis`, and `mod`. It reads in the number of characters (`n`) and the number of known relationships (`m`), followed by the adjacency list representation of a graph (`e`). It initializes a boolean list `vis` to track visited vertices and processes the graph by performing a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of connected components (`cnt`). For each connected component, it calculates the result (`ans`) as \(2^{cnt} \mod \text{mod}\). If no connected components are found (`cnt == 0`), the result is set to `0`. If a connected component is found, it multiplies `ans` by `2` for each vertex in the component and takes the result modulo `1,000,000,007`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. The function assumes the input values are within specified bounds (3 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 100,000). If these constraints are not met, the function behavior is undefined.
2. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values for `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `c`.
3. The function does not validate that the adjacency list `e` is correctly formatted or that it represents a valid graph structure.
4. The function does not explicitly check for cycles in the graph, which could lead to infinite recursion if not handled properly.
5. The function does not provide any error handling or feedback for unexpected input conditions or errors during execution.
