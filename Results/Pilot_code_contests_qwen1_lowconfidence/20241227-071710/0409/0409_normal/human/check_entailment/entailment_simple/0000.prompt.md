You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a1 = 0, an = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, aj - ai = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.

Input

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 2 ≤ l ≤ 109, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 = a1 < a2 < ... < an = l), where ai shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.

Output

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pv (0 ≤ pi ≤ l). Number pi means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of pi centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3 250 185 230
0 185 250


Output

1
230


Input

4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250


Output

0


Input

2 300 185 230
0 300


Output

2
185 230

Note

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Alternatively, if `x_solved` is not initially `True` or `y_solved` becomes `True` in the if part, then `x_solved` remains `False`, `y_solved` remains `False`, `magic_tick` remains as found during the loop, `i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, and the console displays "NameError: name 'x' is not defined".
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x_solved` and `y_solved` indicate whether there exist elements in `marks` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x` and `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, respectively. If both are solved (`x_solved` and `y_solved` are `True`), the function returns `0`. Otherwise, `magic_tick` is either the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the specified range or `None`, `x_solved` and `y_solved` are updated accordingly, and the final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches. Additionally, if `x_solved` is not initially `True` or `y_solved` becomes `True` in the if part, `x_solved` remains `False`, `y_solved` remains `False`, and the console displays "NameError: name 'x' is not defined".

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
