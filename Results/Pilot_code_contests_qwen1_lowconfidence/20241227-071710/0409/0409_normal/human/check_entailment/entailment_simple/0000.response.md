Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Logic for Checking if Distances Can Be Measured**:
   - The program uses binary search to check if the distances \(x\) and \(y\) can be measured with the existing marks. However, the implementation of binary search and the subsequent checks for `x` and `y` are flawed. Specifically, the binary search indices and comparisons are not handled correctly, leading to incorrect conclusions about whether the distances can be measured.

2. **Handling the Cases When Distances Cannot Be Measured**:
   - The program attempts to find a position to insert additional marks by iterating through possible shifts (`x`, `-x`, `y`, `x`, `y`). However, this approach is incomplete and does not guarantee finding the minimum number of additional marks needed. The logic to determine the optimal position for the new marks is not fully developed.

3. **Incorrect Output Format**:
   - The program prints results in a way that doesn’t always align with the expected output format. For example, if no valid positions are found for the additional marks, it should print `2` followed by the values of `x` and `y`, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not properly handle edge cases, such as when the initial marks already allow measuring both `x` and `y`, or when the marks are too sparse to allow direct measurement but need specific shifts to find the correct position for the additional marks.

To ensure the program is correct, it should:
- Properly use binary search to check if the distances can be measured.
- Correctly determine the minimum number of additional marks needed.
- Ensure the output format matches the expected format.

Here’s a simplified outline of how the program could be corrected:

1. Use binary search to check if the distances \(x\) and \(y\) can be measured directly with the existing marks.
2. If not, iterate through possible positions to find the minimum number of additional marks needed.
3. Ensure the output is formatted correctly.

By addressing these issues, the program would correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.
