You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a1 = 0, an = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, aj - ai = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.

Input

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 2 ≤ l ≤ 109, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 = a1 < a2 < ... < an = l), where ai shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.

Output

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pv (0 ≤ pi ≤ l). Number pi means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of pi centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3 250 185 230
0 185 250


Output

1
230


Input

4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250


Output

0


Input

2 300 185 230
0 300


Output

2
185 230

Note

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where neither `x` nor `y` can be measured with the existing marks, but both can be achieved by adding a single mark.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  3 250 185 230
  0 185 250
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  230
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  1
  230
  ```

This example works correctly as the program suggests adding a 230 cm mark to measure the 230 cm distance.

However, consider this different example:
- Input:
  ```
  4 250 185 230
  0 20 185 250
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  1
  230
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly suggests adding a 230 cm mark, although no additional mark is necessary since the marks at 185 cm and 250 cm can be used to measure both 185 cm and 230 cm.

Since the program does not correctly identify cases where no additional marks are needed, it fails to meet the requirements for all potential inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x_solved` remains `False`, `y_solved` remains `False`, `magic_tick` remains as found during the loop (either the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the range `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None`), `i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, and the console displays "NameError: name 'x' is not defined".
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x_solved` is `True` and `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is either the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the range `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None`, the final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches. Alternatively, if `x_solved` is not initially `True` or `y_solved` becomes `True` in the if part, then `x_solved` remains `False`, `y_solved` remains `False`, `magic_tick` remains as found during the loop, `i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, and the console displays "NameError: name 'x' is not defined".
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x_solved` and `y_solved` indicate whether there exist elements in `marks` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x` and `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, respectively. If both are solved (`x_solved` and `y_solved` are `True`), the function returns `0`. Otherwise, `magic_tick` is either the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the specified range or `None`, `x_solved` and `y_solved` are updated accordingly, and the final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches. Additionally, if `x_solved` is not initially `True` or `y_solved` becomes `True` in the if part, `x_solved` remains `False`, `y_solved` remains `False`, and the console displays "NameError: name 'x' is not defined".
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a sequence of integers `marks` and checks if there are elements in the sequence that satisfy specific conditions related to the values of `x` and `y`. Specifically, it looks for elements in `marks` such that each element plus `x` and `y` results in another element in the sequence. The function performs several checks and calculations using binary search and nested loops to find these elements. Based on the findings, it prints one of three possible outputs: `0`, `1` followed by the value of either `x` or `y`, or `2` followed by the value of `x` and `y`. If no valid elements are found, it returns `2` and prints `x` and `y`.

Potential edge cases include:
1. The sequence `marks` might not contain any elements that satisfy the conditions, leading to the function printing `2` and `x` and `y`.
2. The function might not initialize `x_solved` and `y_solved` correctly if the initial conditions do not match the expected format, which could lead to incorrect outputs.
3. The nested loops might not properly handle the case where the entire sequence `marks` is checked without finding a valid solution, potentially causing issues with the loop control variables `i` and `j`.

Missing functionality:
1. There is no explicit handling for invalid input formats or values of `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` outside the stated constraints. This could lead to undefined behavior if the input does not conform to the specified ranges.
2. The function does not provide clear feedback if the input does not meet the required conditions, such as `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9`, and `1 ≤ x < y ≤ l`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
