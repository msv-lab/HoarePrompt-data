Postcondition: ***`x_solved` is `True` and `y_solved` is `True` if there exists an element in `marks` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x` and `marks[res_y] == mark + y` respectively, otherwise `x_solved` and `y_solved` remain as they were before the loop. `magic_tick` is `None`. The final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches. The condition `(x_solved and y_solved)` is true.***
