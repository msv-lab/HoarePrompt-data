The code assigns the value of `marks[i] + shift_x` to `magic_tick`. Given that `i` and `j` are integers less than `n`, and the precondition states that if `i >= n` or `j >= n`, the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `magic_tick`, `shift_x`, and `shift_y` remain unchanged, this condition does not apply since `i < n`.

Therefore, the value of `magic_tick` is updated to `marks[i] + shift_x`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is an integer less than `n`, `n` remains unchanged, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`, `shift_x` remains unchanged, `shift_y` remains unchanged.**
