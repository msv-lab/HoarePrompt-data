The `break` statement does not change the values of variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either 0 or 1**
