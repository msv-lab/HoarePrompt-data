Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are integers. If the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` is satisfied, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. If the condition is not satisfied, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and the program continues to loop until either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
