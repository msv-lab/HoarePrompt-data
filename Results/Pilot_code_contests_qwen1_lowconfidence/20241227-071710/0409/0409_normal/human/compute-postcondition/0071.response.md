Postcondition: ***`i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1. If the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` does not hold (i.e., `0 > marks[1] + shift_x OR marks[1] + shift_x > l`), then `i` and `j` are both set to 1.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts of the if-else block, ensuring that the final state of `i`, `j`, and the additional variable `magic_tick` (if applicable) is accurately described based on the given conditions.
