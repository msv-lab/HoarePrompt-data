The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block, but in this case, there is no loop or conditional block that would be exited by this statement. The only thing that happens is that the `break` statement is executed, which does not change any variable values. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **marks[i] + shift_x is calculated and assigned to magic_tick, no other changes to the variables**
