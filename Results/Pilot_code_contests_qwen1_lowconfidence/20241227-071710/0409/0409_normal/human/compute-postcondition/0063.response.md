The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition `(marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y)` holds true, which means that this condition was already satisfied before the increment. Therefore, the condition will still hold true after the increment because `i` has only increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y)` holds true**
