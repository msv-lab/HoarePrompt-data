`magic_tick` is assigned the value `marks[i] + shift_x`. The values of `i` and `j` are integers, and the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. The values of `marks` and `shift_x` are not provided, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`; `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
