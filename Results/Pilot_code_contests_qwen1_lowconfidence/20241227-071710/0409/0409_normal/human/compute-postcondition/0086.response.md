To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `while True` loop continues.

Given the initial states at the end of the previous iteration:
- \( i \) and \( j \) are either 0 or 1.
- The condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` leads to specific changes in \( i \) and \( j \):
  - \( i \) is either 0 or 1.
  - \( j \) is either 1 or 2 depending on its initial value.
- The condition `marks[i] + shift_x <= marks[j] + shift_y` leads to different changes in \( i \) and \( j \):
  - If \( 0 \leq marks[i] + shift_x \leq l \), then \( i \) remains unchanged and \( j \) is either 0 or 1.
  - If \( marks[i] + shift_x \) is outside the range \([0, l]\), then \( i \) is set to 1 and \( j \) is either 1 or 2.

For the `while True` loop to execute one more time, there are no specific conditions based on the loop itself (since it's an infinite loop). Therefore, we don't need to adjust any states based on the loop's condition alone.

However, since the loop continues indefinitely, we can infer that no matter what the current values of \( i \) and \( j \) are, the loop will continue to execute. Thus, we don't need to enforce any specific conditions on \( i \) and \( j \).
