Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are both integers. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true, then `i` and `j` remain 0, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[0] - x`, and the loop or conditional statement is broken out. Otherwise, `i` and `j` are both incremented to 1, and `magic_tick` remains unchanged.***
