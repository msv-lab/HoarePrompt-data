The code snippet `res_y = bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + y, lo=i)` impacts the following:

1. `res_y` is assigned the index in the list (or the key in the map) where `mark + y` would be inserted to keep the sequence sorted. The `lo=i` parameter means the search starts from index `i`.

Since the exact values of `marks`, `mark`, `y`, and `i` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `res_y`. However, we know the following:

- `x_solved` and `y_solved` remain `False` unless there is additional logic that checks the conditions after this line.
- `magic_tick` remains `None` unless there is additional logic that sets its value after this line.
- `i` remains 0 unless the bisect operation modifies it, which it does not in this case.
- `mark` remains unchanged because the bisect operation does not modify the value of `mark`.

The only new variable introduced is `res_y`, which will contain the result of the `bisect.bisect_left` function.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks` is a map object containing \(n\) integers, `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is 0, `mark` is the first item in `marks`, and `res_y` is the index where `mark + y` would be inserted to keep `marks` sorted starting from index `i`.**
