Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. If neither condition is satisfied, `i` and `j` are each incremented by 1, and the program continues to loop until either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
