Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are indices, `n` is an unchanged value, `l` is an unchanged upper limit, `shift_x` is an unchanged shift value, and `marks` is an unchanged list. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is assigned the value of `marks[i] + shift_x`; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1, and `magic_tick` remains unchanged.***
