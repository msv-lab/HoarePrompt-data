State right before the while loop, the conditions given are:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0
- `n` must not be equal to `n` (which is impossible as no two distinct values can simultaneously be equal and not equal)
- `magic_tick` remains unchanged
- `shift_x` is -x
- `shift_y` is y

The `while True` loop means the loop will always execute as long as the condition is not explicitly broken from within the loop.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to proceed.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y**
