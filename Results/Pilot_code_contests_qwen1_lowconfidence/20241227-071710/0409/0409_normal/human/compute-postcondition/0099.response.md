To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop's condition and how it affects the variables `shift_x` and `shift_y`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the tuples `(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` and `j` are indices that have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met.
   - `magic_tick` is the value of `marks[i] + shift_x` if the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` is met, otherwise `magic_tick` remains unchanged.
   - `marks`, `n`, `l`, and `shift_x` are unchanged.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop continues as long as there are tuples left to iterate over.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that there is another tuple `(shift_x, shift_y)` to process.

### Adjusting States:

- Since the loop iterates over a fixed set of tuples, the variables `i` and `j` are irrelevant for determining whether the loop can continue. The loop will always proceed to the next tuple regardless of the values of `i` and `j`.
- The variable `magic_tick` is derived from `marks[i] + shift_x` but does not affect the loop continuation. Therefore, its value remains unchanged.
- The variables `marks`, `n`, `l`, and `shift_x` are unchanged and remain the same.

Given these points, the only change needed is to identify the next tuple in the sequence `(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)`.

### New State:

- The loop will move to the next tuple in the sequence. The current tuple is `(x, y)`, so the next tuple is `(-x, y)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` and `j` are unchanged, `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, `marks`, `n`, `l` remain unchanged**.
