Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer less than `n` and `j` is an integer less than `n`. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`. Otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `magic_tick`, `shift_x`, and `shift_y`) remain unchanged.***
