Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, `magic_tick` remains `None`, `shift_x` and `shift_y` are either `x`, `-x`, `y`, or `x`, `y`, `marks`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged, and no valid `magic_tick` is found during the loop.**
