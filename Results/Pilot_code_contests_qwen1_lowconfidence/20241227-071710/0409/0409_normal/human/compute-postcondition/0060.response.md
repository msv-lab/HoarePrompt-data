`j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is `0 + 1 = 1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y)` still holds true. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `j` and retains the original conditions for `i`, `j`, and the marks condition.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. The current values satisfy the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y)`**
