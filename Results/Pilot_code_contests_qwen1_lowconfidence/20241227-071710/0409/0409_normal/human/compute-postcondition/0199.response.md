Postcondition: ***`x_solved` remains `False`, `y_solved` remains `False`, `magic_tick` remains as found during the loop (either the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the range `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None`), `i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, and the console displays "NameError: name 'x' is not defined".***
