`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` and the condition related to `i` and `n` do not change, meaning if `i` was already greater than or equal to `n`, the break condition remains the same. The state of `i` is not affected, so the output state is: `i` and `j` are integers; `j` is increased by 1; if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `j` is increased by 1; if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
