Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, `marks`, `n`, `l` remain unchanged, and we break out of the nearest loop or conditional statement if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `marks[i] + shift_x` is less than 0 or greater than l.**
