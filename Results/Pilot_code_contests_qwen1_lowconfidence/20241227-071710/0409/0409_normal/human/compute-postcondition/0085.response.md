Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are either 0 or 1. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is either 0 or 1 and `j` is either 1 or 2 depending on its initial value. If `marks[i] + shift_x <= marks[j] + shift_y`, then:
- If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `i` remains unchanged and `j` is either 0 or 1.
- If `marks[i] + shift_x` is outside the range `[0, l]`, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is either 1 or 2.***
