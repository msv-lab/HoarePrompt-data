The code `print(y)` prints the value of `y`, but does not assign or modify any variables. The value of `y` remains the same as its initial state, which is `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `None`, the final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches; `y` is `False`**
