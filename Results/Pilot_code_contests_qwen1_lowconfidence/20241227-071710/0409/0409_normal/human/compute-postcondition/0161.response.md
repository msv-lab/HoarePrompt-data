`i` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `i` and `j` are 0, and they are both set to 0. Since `i` was initially 0 and now it is incremented by 1, `i` becomes 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. The condition `marks[i] + shift_x < 0 or marks[i] + shift_x > l` holds true.**
