Postcondition: ***`x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is either `True` or unchanged, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is `1`, `mark` is the second item in `marks`, `res_y` is the index where `mark + y` would be inserted to keep `marks` sorted starting from index `1`, `res_x` is within the range `[0, n-1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `mark + x > l`. If the condition `mark + x > l` is not met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
