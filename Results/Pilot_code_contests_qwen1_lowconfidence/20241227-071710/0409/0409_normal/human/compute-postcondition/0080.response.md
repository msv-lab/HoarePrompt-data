The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the only thing we can conclude is that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement we were inside. However, since no such structure exists, the variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either 0 or 1**
