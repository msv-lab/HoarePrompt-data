Postcondition: ***`x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `None`, the final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches.***

This postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and explicitly states the condition that caused the execution of the if statement, which is `x_solved` being `True` and `y_solved` being `False`.
