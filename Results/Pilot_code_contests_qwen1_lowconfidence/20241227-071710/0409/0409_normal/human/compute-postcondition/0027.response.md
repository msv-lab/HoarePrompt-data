Postcondition: ***`x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is either `True` or unchanged, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is `1`, `mark` is the second item in `marks`, `res_y` is within `[0, n - 1]`, and `res_x` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + x, lo=i, hi=min(res_y + 1, n))` and remains within `[0, n-1]`. If `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, all these conditions hold true. If `marks[res_x] != mark + x`, the conditions remain as they were before the if statement.***
