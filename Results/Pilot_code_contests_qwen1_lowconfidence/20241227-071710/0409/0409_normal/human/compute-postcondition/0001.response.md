The code `marks = map(int, sys.stdin.next().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each string to an integer, creating a map object. This means that `marks` is now a map object containing integers, but the actual values of these integers are not known until they are accessed. The variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, and `marks` is a map object containing n integers.**
