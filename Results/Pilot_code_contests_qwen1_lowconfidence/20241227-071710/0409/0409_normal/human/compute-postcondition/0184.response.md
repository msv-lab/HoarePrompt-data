The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most nested block it is within. Since there is no loop or nested block in the given code snippet, the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is an integer less than `n`, `n` remains unchanged, `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`, `shift_x` remains unchanged, `shift_y` remains unchanged.**
