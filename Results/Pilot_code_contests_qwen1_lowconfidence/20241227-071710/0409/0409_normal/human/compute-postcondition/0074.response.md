To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the current state after the previous iteration.

### Current State:
- \( i \) and \( j \) are either 0 or 1.
- The loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of.

### Conditions in the Loop:
1. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, stay within the current values of \( i \) and \( j \).
2. If `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then set \( i \) to 1 and \( j \) to 0.
3. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, set `magic_tick` to `marks[i] + shift_x` and break out of the loop.
4. If none of the above conditions hold, set \( i \) and \( j \) to 1.

### Analysis:
Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute another iteration as long as there are no explicit conditions to break out of the loop. Therefore, the only way to prevent an infinite loop is if the loop naturally breaks out due to one of the conditions mentioned.

However, since the task is to modify the program state so that the loop can proceed to the next iteration, we need to ensure that the loop continues based on the given conditions. Given that the loop is `while True`, we don't need to adjust any specific states to ensure it continues; the loop will continue infinitely unless broken out of.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are necessary because the `while True` loop will always execute another iteration unless explicitly broken out of.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 0 or 1**
