The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The initial state of `j` is 0, so after executing this line, `j` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
