The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement directly within the scope of the given code snippet, the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `magic_tick`, `shift_x`, and `shift_y` remain unchanged. The `break` statement itself does not modify any variable values but indicates the end of a loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`**
