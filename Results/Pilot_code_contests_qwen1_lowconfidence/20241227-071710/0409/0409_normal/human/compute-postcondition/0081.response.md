The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `i` and `j` is either 0 or 1, and `i` can only be 1 (because adding 1 to 0 results in 1), the updated value of `i` will be 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `j` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `j` is either 0 or 1**
