Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer less than `n` and `j` is an integer less than `n`. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`; otherwise, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1, and `magic_tick`, `shift_x`, and `shift_y` remain unchanged.***
