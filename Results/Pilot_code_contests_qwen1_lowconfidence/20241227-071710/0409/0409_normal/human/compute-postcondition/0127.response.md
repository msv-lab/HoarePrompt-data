`i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was either greater than or equal to `n` or `j` was greater than or equal to `n`, which means we would have broken out of the loop or if statement. However, since `i` is now incremented by 1, this condition no longer holds, and we do not break out of the loop or if statement anymore. The state of `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is unchanged**
