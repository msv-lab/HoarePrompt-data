The code `res_y = min(max(0, res_y), n - 1)` ensures that `res_y` is clamped between 0 and `n - 1`. Given that `res_y` is already constrained to be between `0` and `n - 1`, this line of code does not change the value of `res_y`.

Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is `True`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is `2`, `mark` is the third item in `marks`, `res_y` is the index where `mark + y` would be inserted in `marks` starting from index `i`, `res_x` is updated to the result of `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + x, lo=i, hi=min(res_y + 1, n))` and remains within `[0, n-1]`**
