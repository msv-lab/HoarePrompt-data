Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are either 0 or 1. If the condition `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y` holds true, we stay within the current values of `i` and `j`. If the condition `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y` holds true, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 0. If the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If none of the conditions hold, then `i` and `j` are both set to 1.***
