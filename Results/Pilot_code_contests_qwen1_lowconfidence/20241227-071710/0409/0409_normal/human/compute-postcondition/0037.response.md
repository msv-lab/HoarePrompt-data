The line `x_solved = True` does not change the value of `x_solved` since it is already `True`. All other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` is `True`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is `2`, `mark` is the third item in `marks`, `res_y` is the index where `mark + y` would be inserted in `marks` starting from index `i`, `res_x` is updated to the result of `bisect.bisect_left(marks, mark + x, lo=i, hi=min(res_y + 1, n))` and remains within `[0, n-1]`**
