`i` is incremented by 1, but the value of `j` remains unchanged, and the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement (either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`) is still valid as the code only modifies `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1; `j` is unchanged; if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `j` is unchanged; if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
