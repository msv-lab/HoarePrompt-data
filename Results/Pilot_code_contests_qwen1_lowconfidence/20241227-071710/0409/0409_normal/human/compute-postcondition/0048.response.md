Postcondition: **`x_solved` is `True` or `False` based on the existence of an element in `marks` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x`, `y_solved` is `True` or `False` based on the existence of an element in `marks` such that `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, `magic_tick` is `None`, the final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches. Additionally, `y_solved` remains `False`.**
