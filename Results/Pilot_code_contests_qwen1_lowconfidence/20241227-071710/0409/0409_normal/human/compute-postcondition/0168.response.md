Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the condition `i >= n or j >= n` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement if there was one.***
