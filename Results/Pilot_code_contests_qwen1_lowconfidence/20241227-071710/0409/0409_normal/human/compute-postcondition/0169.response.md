`j` is incremented by 1. The conditions `i >= n or j >= n` remain valid, meaning either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or the new value of `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. The new value of `j` is `j + 1`.**
