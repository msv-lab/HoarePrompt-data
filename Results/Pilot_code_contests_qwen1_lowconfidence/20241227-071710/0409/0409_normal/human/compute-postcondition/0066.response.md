`magic_tick` is assigned the value of `marks[i] + shift_x`. According to the initial state, the value of `marks[i] + shift_x` is within the range `[0, l]` and the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x >= marks[j] + shift_y)` holds true. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, the condition `(marks[i] + shift_x >= marks[j] + shift_y)` holds true, and the current value of `(marks[i] + shift_x)` is within the range `[0, l]; magic_tick is equal to `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
