Postcondition: **`x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` remains `False`, `magic_tick` is `None`, the final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches. The condition `(not x_solved and x_solved)` is `False`.**
