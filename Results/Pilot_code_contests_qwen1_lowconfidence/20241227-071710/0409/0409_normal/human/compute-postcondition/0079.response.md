In the given code snippet, `magic_tick` is assigned the value of `marks[i] + shift_x`. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `marks`, `i`, and `shift_x`. Since `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, and the precondition does not change these values, `i` remains either 0 or 1. But without knowing the exact values of `marks` and `shift_x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `magic_tick`.

Given the information, the only thing we can definitively say is that `i` remains either 0 or 1, and `j` is unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 0 or 1**
