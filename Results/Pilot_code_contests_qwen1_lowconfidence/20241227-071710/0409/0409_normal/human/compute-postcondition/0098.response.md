Output State: **`i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, `magic_tick` is the value of `marks[i] + shift_x` if the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` is met, otherwise `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `marks`, `n`, `l`, and `shift_x` are unchanged.**
