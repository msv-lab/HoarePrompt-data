Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `l` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq l \leq 10^9\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `y` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < y \leq l\), `marks` is a map object containing \(n\) integers, `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is 0, `mark` is the first item in `marks`, and the current value of `mark` plus `x` is greater than `l`**
