`i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially an integer less than `n`, after incrementing, `i` will be an integer less than `n` unless it reaches or exceeds `n`, in which case it remains unchanged. However, since the condition `i >= n` is only checked if it happens, and it's guaranteed to not reach `n` in this case (because `i` starts as an integer less than `n`), `i` will simply be incremented by 1.

The values of `j`, `n`, `magic_tick`, `shift_x`, and `shift_y` remain unchanged as per the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n` plus one, `j` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is unchanged, `magic_tick` is unchanged, `shift_x` is unchanged, `shift_y` is unchanged.**
