Postcondition: ***`x_solved` is `True`, `y_solved` remains `False`, `magic_tick` is `None`, `i` is `0`, `mark` is the first item in `marks`, `res_y` is the index where `mark + y` would be inserted to keep `marks` sorted starting from index `i`, `res_x` is within the range [0, n-1], and if `marks[res_x]` equals `mark + x`, these conditions are met; otherwise, `y_solved` remains unchanged.***
