`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains as `i + 1` because the code does not modify it, and the loop continues until the condition `i >= n` or `j >= n` is met. The initial state of `i` being `i + 1` and `j` being unchanged is preserved.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, and we continue to loop unless the condition `i >= n` or `j >= n` is met.**
