Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are either 0 or 1. If the condition `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y` holds true, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. Otherwise, if the condition `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true, then `magic_tick` is set to `marks[i] + shift_x`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If neither condition holds, then `i` and `j` are both set to 1.**
