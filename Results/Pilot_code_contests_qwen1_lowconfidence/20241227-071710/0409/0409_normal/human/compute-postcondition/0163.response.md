Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 1.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, covering both the if and else cases as specified.
