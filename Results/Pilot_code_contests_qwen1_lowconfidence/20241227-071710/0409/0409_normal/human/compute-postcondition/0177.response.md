Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`. If the condition `i >= n or j >= n` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement if there was one. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, `i` is incremented by 1. If neither condition holds, either `i` or `j` is incremented by 1, and the condition `i >= n or j >= n` is checked again.***
