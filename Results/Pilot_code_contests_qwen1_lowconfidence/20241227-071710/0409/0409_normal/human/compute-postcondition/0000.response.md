The code reads four integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`. Since the exact values are not specified in the initial state, we can represent the updated values as follows:

- `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values read from standard input, which are positive integers with the constraints given.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values read from standard input, which are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l.**
