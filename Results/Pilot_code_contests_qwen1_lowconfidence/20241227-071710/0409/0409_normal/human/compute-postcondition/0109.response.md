`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was initially 0, so now it is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, `marks`, `n`, `l` remain unchanged, and we break out of the nearest loop or conditional statement if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
