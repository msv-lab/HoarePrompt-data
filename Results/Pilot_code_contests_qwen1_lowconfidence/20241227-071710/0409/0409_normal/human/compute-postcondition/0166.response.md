Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` and `j` are integers.
   - `n` must not be equal to `n` (this condition is impossible, so we can ignore it).
   - `magic_tick` remains unchanged.
   - `shift_x` is `-x`.
   - `shift_y` is `y`.
   - Either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is `while True`, which means it will always execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 1.
   - Otherwise, either `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 0, or the loop or statement breaks when `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, or both `i` and `j` are set to 1.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute another iteration unless there is an explicit break statement.
   - We need to ensure that the conditions inside the loop are consistent for the next iteration.

5. **Possible Transitions:**
   - If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is set to 0 and `j` is set to 1.
   - If this condition is not met, we need to consider the other possible outcomes. However, since the loop is `while True`, these conditions will eventually be met in some iteration, but we only need to ensure the states at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Given that the loop is `while True`, the states `i` and `j` can transition to any valid state that satisfies the loop's logic. But for simplicity, we can assume the worst-case scenario where the loop continues indefinitely without breaking out.
   - Therefore, no specific adjustment is needed because the loop will continue regardless of the current values of `i` and `j`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` and `j` are integers, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`**.

Since the loop is `while True`, no specific adjustments are needed for the states to proceed to the next iteration.
