The code `break` does not assign any new values to variables. Instead, it breaks out of the nearest loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement if there was one.**
