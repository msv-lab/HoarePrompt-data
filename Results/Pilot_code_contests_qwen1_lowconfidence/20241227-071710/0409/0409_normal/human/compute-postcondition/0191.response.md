Output State: **`i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, `magic_tick` is the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the range `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `shift_x` and `shift_y` are either `x`, `-x`, `y`, or `x`, `y`, `marks`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. If no valid `magic_tick` is found during the loop, `i` and `j` will be equal to `n`, and `magic_tick` will remain `None`.**
