Let's break down the given code and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- The initial state before the loop starts is as follows:
  - `x_solved` is `False`
  - `y_solved` is `False`
  - `magic_tick` is `None`
  - The final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop
  - `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`
  - `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches

- The loop iterates over the tuple `[(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)]` and performs some operations within the loop body for each pair `(shift_x, shift_y)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over a fixed set of tuples `[(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)]`.
   - The loop itself will always execute exactly 4 times regardless of the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Variables Inside the Loop**:
   - The variables `shift_x` and `shift_y` take on the values from the tuple `[(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (x, y)]` one by one.
   - There are no additional variables declared or modified inside the loop body that would require adjustment.

3. **Final States**:
   - The final states mentioned (`final i`, `mark`, `res_x`, `res_y`) are the results of the loop iterations and not conditions for the loop to execute.
   - The states `x_solved` and `y_solved` being `False` indicate that the loop might be part of a larger process where these flags are set based on the loop's outcome.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop will always execute 4 times, there are no conditions based on the values of `x`, `y`, `x_solved`, `y_solved`, `magic_tick`, `marks`, `mark`, `res_x`, and `res_y` that would prevent the loop from executing. Therefore, no adjustments to the initial states are necessary for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **No adjustments needed**
