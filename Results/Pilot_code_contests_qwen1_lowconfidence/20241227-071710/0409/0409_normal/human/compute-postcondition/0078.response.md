The code increments `i` by 1. Since the initial state indicates that both `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, and if either `i` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, there is no change to the values of `i` and `j`, we need to consider the following scenarios:

- If `i` is 0, then `i += 1` will make `i` equal to 1.
- If `i` is 1, then `i += 1` will make `i` equal to 2, but since the initial state specifies that `i` and `j` are either 0 or 1, this scenario is not possible.

Thus, the only valid change is when `i` is initially 0, making it 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1**
