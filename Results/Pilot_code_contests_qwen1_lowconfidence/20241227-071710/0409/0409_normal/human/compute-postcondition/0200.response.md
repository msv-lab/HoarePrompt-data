Postcondition: ***`x_solved` is `True` and `y_solved` is `False`, `magic_tick` is either the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the range `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` or `None`, the final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches. Alternatively, if `x_solved` is not initially `True` or `y_solved` becomes `True` in the if part, then `x_solved` remains `False`, `y_solved` remains `False`, `magic_tick` remains as found during the loop, `i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, and the console displays "NameError: name 'x' is not defined".***
