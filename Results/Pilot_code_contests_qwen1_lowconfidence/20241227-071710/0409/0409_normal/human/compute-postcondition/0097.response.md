Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are indices, `n`, `l`, `shift_x`, and `marks` are unchanged. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `j` is increased by 1, and `i` and `magic_tick` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y`, then `i` is increased by 1. If `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `magic_tick` is assigned the value of `marks[i] + shift_x`; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1, and `magic_tick` remains unchanged.***
