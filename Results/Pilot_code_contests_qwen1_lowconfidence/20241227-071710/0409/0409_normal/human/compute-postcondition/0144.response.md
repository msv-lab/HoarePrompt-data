Output State: **`i` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `j` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `magic_tick` is the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the range `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, `marks`, `n`, `l` remain unchanged. If no valid `magic_tick` is found during the loop, `i` and `j` will be equal to `n`, and `magic_tick` will remain unchanged.**
