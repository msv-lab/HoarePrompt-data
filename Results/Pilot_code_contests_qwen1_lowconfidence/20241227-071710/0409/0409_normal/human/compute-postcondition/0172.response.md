The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or match-case statement. Since the initial state includes that we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement if there was one, this condition is already satisfied, and no further changes are made to the variables.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`, `marks` is unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y', and we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement.**
