The code prints the values of `x` and `y` using the format `'%i %i'`. However, the variables `x` and `y` are not defined in the initial state, and there is no code that defines them before the print statement. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` remain undefined.

No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, `magic_tick` remains `None`, `shift_x` and `shift_y` are either `x`, `-x`, `y`, or `x`, `y`, `marks`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged, and no valid `magic_tick` is found during the loop. Values of `x` and `y` are undefined.**
