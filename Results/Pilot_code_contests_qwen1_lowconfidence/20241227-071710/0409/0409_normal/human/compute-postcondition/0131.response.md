Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers. If `marks[i] + shift_x > marks[j] + shift_y`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `j` is increased by 1. Additionally, if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Furthermore, if `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` holds true at any point, we break out of the current block or function.***
