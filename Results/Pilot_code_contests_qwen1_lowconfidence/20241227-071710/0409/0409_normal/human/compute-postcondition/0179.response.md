The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `magic_tick`, `shift_x`, and `shift_y`. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement, which is not present in this case. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a constant value, `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`**
