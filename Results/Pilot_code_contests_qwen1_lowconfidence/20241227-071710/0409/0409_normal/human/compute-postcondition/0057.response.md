The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. However, since no such statement exists, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
