The variable `y_solved` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `y_solved` is explicitly set to `False`, and this assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `y_solved`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a map object containing n integers, `x_solved` is `False`, `y_solved` is `False`**
