`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the loop (either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`) still holds true. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; `j` is increased by 1; if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
