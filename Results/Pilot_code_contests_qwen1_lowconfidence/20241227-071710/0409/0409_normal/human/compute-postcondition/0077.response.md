`j` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `j` can only be 0 or 1, after adding 1, `j` will be 1 if it was initially 0, and will be 2 if it was initially 1. However, the condition in the initial state specifies that if either `i` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, the values of `i` and `j` do not change. Since `n` is not specified, we cannot determine if `j` becomes greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the only change is to `j`.

Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either 1 or 2 depending on its initial value**
