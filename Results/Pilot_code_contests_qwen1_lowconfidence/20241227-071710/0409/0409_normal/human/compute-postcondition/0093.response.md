The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `j`, or `n`, and the if and else conditions in the example do not affect these variables, the only change is that `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `j` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged**
