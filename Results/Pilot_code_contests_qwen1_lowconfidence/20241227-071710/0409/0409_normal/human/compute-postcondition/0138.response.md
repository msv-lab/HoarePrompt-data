The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. However, no variables are modified by this statement. The initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are integers; if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`.**
