According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as long as it is entered. Since it is a `while True` loop, no conditions need to be checked or adjusted to make it execute one more time. Therefore, we do not need to modify any of the given states.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, `marks`, `n`, `l` remain unchanged**
