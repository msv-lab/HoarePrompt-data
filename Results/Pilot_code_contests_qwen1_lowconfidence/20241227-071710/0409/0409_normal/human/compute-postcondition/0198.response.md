Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are indices where the loop control variables have been incremented until the conditions `i >= n` or `j >= n` are met, `magic_tick` remains as found during the loop, either being the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the range `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l` if such a value exists (with the condition printed as `1`), or `None` if no valid `magic_tick` is found. `shift_x` and `shift_y` are either `x`, `-x`, `y`, or `x`, `y`, `marks`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. Values of `x` and `y` are undefined if no valid `magic_tick` is found.**
