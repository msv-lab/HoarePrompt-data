The code increments `i` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, we only know that `i` was an integer. After the increment, `i` is now one more than its original value. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the loop (either `i` being greater than or equal to `n` or `j` being greater than or equal to `n`) remains the same. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is an integer that is one more than its original value, `j` is an integer, and if either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
