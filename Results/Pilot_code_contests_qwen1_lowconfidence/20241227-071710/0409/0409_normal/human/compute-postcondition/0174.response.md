`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` being incremented by 1 or `j` being incremented by 1 does not affect the condition that either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
