Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers. If either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no specific action in the else part, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the program continues to loop indefinitely unless the condition is met.***
