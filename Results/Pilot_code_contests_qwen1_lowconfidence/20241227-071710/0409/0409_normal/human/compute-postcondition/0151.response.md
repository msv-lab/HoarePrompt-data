Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y`**
