`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The condition `(marks[i] + shift_x >= marks[j] + shift_y)` and `(0 > marks[i] + shift_x OR marks[i] + shift_x > l)` remain unchanged because the code only increments `i` and does not affect `j`, `shift_x`, `shift_y`, `marks`, or `l`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and retains the conditions.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, the condition `(marks[1] + shift_x >= marks[0] + shift_y)` holds true, and `(0 > marks[1] + shift_x OR marks[1] + shift_x > l)`**
