`magic_tick` is assigned the value `marks[i] + shift_x`. The previous value of `magic_tick` is not specified, but it is now `marks[i] + shift_x`. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `marks`, `shift_x`, and `shift_y` remain unchanged. The condition `i >= n or j >= n` is still true, so we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement if there was one.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` is `marks[i] + shift_x`, `marks` is unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or match-case statement if there was one.**
