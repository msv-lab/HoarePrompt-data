`j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is 0, so after the increment, `j` becomes 1. The other variables (`i` and the conditions) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, the condition `(marks[1] + shift_x >= marks[0] + shift_y)` holds true, and `(0 > marks[1] + shift_x OR marks[1] + shift_x > l)`.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, the condition `(marks[1] + shift_x >= marks[0] + shift_y)` holds true, and `(0 > marks[1] + shift_x OR marks[1] + shift_x > l)`**
