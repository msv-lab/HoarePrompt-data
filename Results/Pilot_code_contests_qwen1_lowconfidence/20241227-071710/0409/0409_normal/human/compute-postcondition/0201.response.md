Postcondition: ***`x_solved` and `y_solved` indicate whether there exist elements in `marks` such that `marks[res_x] == mark + x` and `marks[res_y] == mark + y`, respectively. If both are solved (`x_solved` and `y_solved` are `True`), the function returns `0`. Otherwise, `magic_tick` is either the maximum value of `marks[i] + shift_x` within the specified range or `None`, `x_solved` and `y_solved` are updated accordingly, and the final `i` is the last index in `marks` checked by the loop, `mark` is the corresponding element in `marks`, and `res_x` and `res_y` are the final indices calculated by the binary searches. Additionally, if `x_solved` is not initially `True` or `y_solved` becomes `True` in the if part, `x_solved` remains `False`, `y_solved` remains `False`, and the console displays "NameError: name 'x' is not defined".***
