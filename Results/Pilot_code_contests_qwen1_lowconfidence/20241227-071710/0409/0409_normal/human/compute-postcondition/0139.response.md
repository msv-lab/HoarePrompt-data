`i` is incremented by 1, but since there is no specific value for `n` given initially, and no condition is met to break out of the loop, the value of `i` is updated while `j` remains unchanged. The precondition that either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n` remains intact.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `j` is unchanged, and we continue to loop unless the condition `i >= n` or `j >= n` is met.**
