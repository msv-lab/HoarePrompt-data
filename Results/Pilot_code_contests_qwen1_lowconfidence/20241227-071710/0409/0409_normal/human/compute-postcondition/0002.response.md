`x_solved` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The initial values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and `marks` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a map object containing n integers, and `x_solved` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `l` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `y` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l, `marks` is a map object containing n integers, `x_solved` is `False`**
