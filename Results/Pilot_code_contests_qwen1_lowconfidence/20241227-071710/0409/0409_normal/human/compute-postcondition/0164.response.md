Postcondition: **`i` and `j` are integers, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is `-x`, `shift_y` is `y`, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the condition `marks[i] + shift_x < marks[j] + shift_y` holds true, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 0. Otherwise, the loop or statement breaks when `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`, or `i` and `j` are both set to 1.**
