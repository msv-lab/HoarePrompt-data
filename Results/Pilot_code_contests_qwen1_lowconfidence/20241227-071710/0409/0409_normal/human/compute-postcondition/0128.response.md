`j` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged from its previous state where it was incremented by 1, and `j` was unchanged before this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `j` is incremented by 1**
