The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `j` was 0, so after executing the code, `j` will be 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` remains unchanged, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `marks[i] + shift_x` is greater than `marks[j] + shift_y`**
