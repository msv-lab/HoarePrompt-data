`j` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` is the original value of `j` plus 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `magic_tick`, `shift_x`, and `shift_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n` and equals the original value of `i` plus one; `j` is an integer less than `n` and equals the original value of `j` plus one; `n` remains unchanged; `magic_tick` remains unchanged; `shift_x` remains unchanged; `shift_y` remains unchanged.**
