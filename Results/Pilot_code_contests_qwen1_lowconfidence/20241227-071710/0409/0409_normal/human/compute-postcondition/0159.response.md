The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, since there are no loops or conditional statements being explicitly handled in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the execution will exit the context where the `break` statement is placed. However, since no such context is provided in the initial state, we assume the `break` statement is exiting an implied loop or conditional block.

Given the initial state and the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` must not be equal to `n` (impossible), `magic_tick` is `marks[0] - x`, `shift_x` is -x, `shift_y` is y, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than or equal to `n`. The condition `marks[i] + shift_x >= marks[j] + shift_y` holds true, and `0 <= marks[i] + shift_x <= l`. And we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
