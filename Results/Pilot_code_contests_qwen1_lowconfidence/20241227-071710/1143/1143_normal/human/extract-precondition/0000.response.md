Precondition: **The function `func_3` does not use any of its intended parameters, and instead initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of \(10^7\). However, based on the problem description, no parameters are provided in the function signature, which is unusual given the context. The list initialization suggests it might be part of a larger solution or a helper function, but it doesn't directly relate to the problem's requirements.**

Given the context of the problem, the function signature should ideally include parameters related to the heights of the stones and the number of stones. Since `func_3` is not solving the main problem as described, we focus on the variables and relationships implied by the problem statement, rather than the incomplete function signature. 

For completeness, if we were to define a function based on the problem description, it would look something like this:

```python
import sys
from heapq import heappop, heappush

def min_jump_cost(N, K, h):
    dp = [sys.maxsize] * (N + 1)
    dp[1] = 0  # Initial cost is 0 as the frog starts at stone 1
    
    # Priority queue to store the current cost and the stone index
    pq = [(0, 1)]
    
    while pq:
        cost, i = heappop(pq)
        
        # Explore all possible jumps from the current stone
        for j in range(i + 1, min(i + K + 1, N + 1)):
            jump_cost = abs(h[i] - h[j])
            if cost + jump_cost < dp[j]:
                dp[j] = cost + jump_cost
                heappush(pq, (dp[j], j))
                
    return dp[N]

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    h = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_jump_cost(N, K, h))
```

In this context, the precondition for the problem would be:

**Precondition: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 10^5, K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= 100, and h is a list of N integers such that 1 <= h_i <= 10^4.**
