The function processes an array `arr` of length `n` where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\), and finds the minimum cost to reach the end of the array using a sliding window approach. The cost to move from index `i-j` to index `i` is defined as `abs(arr[i-j] - arr[i])`. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[0] = 0` and each subsequent element is the minimum cost to reach that index from any previous index within a distance `k`. After executing the function, the state of the program will be that `dp[-1]` contains the minimum cost to reach the last index of `arr`. If no valid path is found (i.e., all `dp` values remain -1), `dp[-1]` will still be -1. The function does not return any value.
