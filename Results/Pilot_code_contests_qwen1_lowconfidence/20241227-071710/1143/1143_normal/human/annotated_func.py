#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 100, arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4 for all 0 <= i < n, and dp is a list of n integers initialized to -1 except dp[0] which is set to 0.
def func_1():
    n, k = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0

                    dp[i] = tem

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are either the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0` or `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an array `arr` of length `n` where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\), and finds the minimum cost to reach the end of the array using a sliding window approach. The cost to move from index `i-j` to index `i` is defined as `abs(arr[i-j] - arr[i])`. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[0] = 0` and each subsequent element is the minimum cost to reach that index from any previous index within a distance `k`. After executing the function, the state of the program will be that `dp[-1]` contains the minimum cost to reach the last index of `arr`. If no valid path is found (i.e., all `dp` values remain -1), `dp[-1]` will still be -1. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of length 10^7 initialized to 0.
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` initializes a list `l` of length \(10^7\) with all elements set to 0 and does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program state includes a list `l` of length \(10^7\) where every element is 0. There are no return values or further operations performed by the function. This means the function solely serves to create and initialize this list without any modifications or additional actions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not use any of its intended parameters, and instead initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of \(10^7\). However, based on the problem description, no parameters are provided in the function signature, which is unusual given the context. The list initialization suggests it might be part of a larger solution or a helper function, but it doesn't directly relate to the problem's requirements.
def func_3():
    l = [(0) for i in range(10 ** 7)]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a list `l` containing \(10^7\) elements, each initialized to zero. The function does not perform any operations on the list or any other variables, and it does not modify the state of any external variables. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, as the list is simply initialized and returned without any further processing.
