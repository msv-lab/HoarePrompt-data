Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided contains only the definition of `func_1` and two incomplete functions (`func_2` and `func_3`). The incomplete functions suggest that they might have been part of a solution, but they are not implemented. Moreover, the implementation of `func_1` is not complete; it reads inputs but does not fully process them to find the minimum cost as described in the problem statement.

To verify this, let's consider the following points:
1. The program reads `N` and `K`, and an array `arr` which contains the heights of the stones.
2. It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with `-1` values, indicating unvisited states.
3. The DP array is set such that `dp[0] = 0` since the frog starts at Stone 1.
4. The nested loops are intended to fill the DP array, but the logic inside these loops seems incorrect because it does not properly handle the range of jumps allowed (i.e., from `i` to `i + K`).

The provided code snippet lacks the logic to correctly compute the minimum cost for each stone and does not fully implement the dynamic programming approach needed to solve the problem. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description and hence is incorrect.
