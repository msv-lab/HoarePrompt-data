Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum possible total cost for the frog to jump from Stone 1 to Stone N. The code follows the problem description accurately for every potential case:

1. The input format is correctly read and processed.
2. The constraints are handled appropriately.
3. The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized correctly.
4. The nested loops correctly iterate over possible jumps and update the `dp` array with the minimum costs.
5. The final result (`dp[-1]`) is printed, which represents the minimum cost to reach Stone N.

The annotations in the code align with the implementation and the problem description. The first function `func_1` is the main function that performs the required computation, while the other two functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) are not used in the main logic and do not affect the functionality related to solving the problem.

Given that the code handles all cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations accurately reflect the logic, the program is correct for every potential case.
