You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N stones, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), the height of Stone i is h_i.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

* If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, i + K. Here, a cost of |h_i - h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq 100
* 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^4

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
h_1 h_2 \ldots h_N


Output

Print the minimum possible total cost incurred.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 100, arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4 for all 0 <= i < n, and dp is a list of n integers initialized to -1 except dp[0] which is set to 0.
def func_1():
    n, k = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j > -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are either the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0` or `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an array `arr` of length `n` where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\), and finds the minimum cost to reach the end of the array using a sliding window approach. The cost to move from index `i-j` to index `i` is defined as `abs(arr[i-j] - arr[i])`. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[0] = 0` and each subsequent element is the minimum cost to reach that index from any previous index within a distance `k`. After executing the function, the state of the program will be that `dp[-1]` contains the minimum cost to reach the last index of `arr`. If no valid path is found (i.e., all `dp` values remain -1), `dp[-1]` will still be -1. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of length 10^7 initialized to 0.
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` initializes a list `l` of length \(10^7\) with all elements set to 0 and does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program state includes a list `l` of length \(10^7\) where every element is 0. There are no return values or further operations performed by the function. This means the function solely serves to create and initialize this list without any modifications or additional actions.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not use any of its intended parameters, and instead initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of \(10^7\). However, based on the problem description, no parameters are provided in the function signature, which is unusual given the context. The list initialization suggests it might be part of a larger solution or a helper function, but it doesn't directly relate to the problem's requirements.
def func_3():
    l = [(0) for i in range(10 ** 7)]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a list `l` containing \(10^7\) elements, each initialized to zero. The function does not perform any operations on the list or any other variables, and it does not modify the state of any external variables. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, as the list is simply initialized and returned without any further processing.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
