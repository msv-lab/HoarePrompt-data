Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases.

1. **Incomplete Function Definitions**: The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are defined but not used anywhere in the program. This could be a result of incomplete code or debugging attempts. However, the presence of these unused functions might indicate that the developer was experimenting with different approaches, which could lead to confusion or incorrect implementation.

2. **Incorrect Dynamic Programming Approach**: The dynamic programming approach implemented in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the loop starts from `i` and tries to compute `dp[i]` using `dp[i-j]` where `j` ranges from 1 to `k`. This means that the frog can only jump forward, but the problem statement allows jumping to `i+1` to `i+k`. The current implementation would miss valid jumps to `i+2`, `i+3`, etc., and would not correctly compute the minimum cost.

3. **Potential Out-of-Bounds Error**: The inner loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `k`, but it should start from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to avoid accessing negative indices in the `dp` array. This ensures that the frog can jump to the last `k` stones directly without checking past the starting point.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max(0, i - k + 1), i + 1):
            if dp[j] != float('inf'):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]))
    print(dp[-1])
```

With this correction, the program should work for all valid inputs according to the problem description.
