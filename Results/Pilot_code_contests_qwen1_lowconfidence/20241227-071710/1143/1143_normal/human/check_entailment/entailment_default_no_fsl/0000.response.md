Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code only implements `func_1`, which is meant to solve the problem described. However, the problem requires finding the minimum cost to reach Stone N from Stone 1 by jumping up to K stones ahead at each step. The provided code attempts to solve this using dynamic programming but has a critical flaw.

The issue lies in the line:
```python
tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
```
This line incorrectly calculates the cost. It uses `arr[i - j]` instead of `arr[i]` and `arr[i]` instead of `arr[i - j]`, leading to incorrect cost calculations. The correct cost calculation should be:
```python
tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i] - arr[i - j])
```

Additionally, the loop should start from `j = 1` to `K` rather than `j = 1` to `i` as it currently does. The current implementation would lead to incorrect results for many test cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3
10 30 40 50 20
```
The correct output should be `30`, but the provided code would fail to compute this correctly due to the flawed cost calculation logic.

To fix this, the code should be modified to:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, min(k + 1, i + 1)):
            if dp[i - j] != -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i] - arr[i - j])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
    print(dp[-1])
```

With these corrections, the code should work for all valid cases according to the problem description.
