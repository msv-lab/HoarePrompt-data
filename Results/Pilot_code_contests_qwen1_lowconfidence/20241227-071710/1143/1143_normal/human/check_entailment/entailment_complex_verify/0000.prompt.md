You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N stones, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), the height of Stone i is h_i.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

* If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, i + K. Here, a cost of |h_i - h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq 100
* 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^4

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0

        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j > -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
    print(dp[-1])

#Function 3:

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided contains only the definition of `func_1` and two incomplete functions (`func_2` and `func_3`). The incomplete functions suggest that they might have been part of a solution, but they are not implemented. Moreover, the implementation of `func_1` is not complete; it reads inputs but does not fully process them to find the minimum cost as described in the problem statement.

To verify this, let's consider the following points:
1. The program reads `N` and `K`, and an array `arr` which contains the heights of the stones.
2. It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with `-1` values, indicating unvisited states.
3. The DP array is set such that `dp[0] = 0` since the frog starts at Stone 1.
4. The nested loops are intended to fill the DP array, but the logic inside these loops seems incorrect because it does not properly handle the range of jumps allowed (i.e., from `i` to `i + K`).

The provided code snippet lacks the logic to correctly compute the minimum cost for each stone and does not fully implement the dynamic programming approach needed to solve the problem. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description and hence is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

inp = sys.stdin.readline
read = lambda : list(map(int, inp().strip().split()))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 100, arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4 for all 0 <= i < n, and dp is a list of n integers initialized to -1 except dp[0] which is set to 0.
def func_1():
    n, k = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if i - j > -1:
                tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])
                if dp[i] == -1:
                    dp[i] = tem
                elif dp[i] > tem:
                    dp[i] = tem
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are either the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0` or `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an array `arr` of length `n` where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\), and finds the minimum cost to reach the end of the array using a sliding window approach. The cost to move from index `i-j` to index `i` is defined as `abs(arr[i-j] - arr[i])`. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[0] = 0` and each subsequent element is the minimum cost to reach that index from any previous index within a distance `k`. After executing the function, the state of the program will be that `dp[-1]` contains the minimum cost to reach the last index of `arr`. If no valid path is found (i.e., all `dp` values remain -1), `dp[-1]` will still be -1. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of length 10^7 initialized to 0.
def func_2():
    l = [0] * 10 ** 7
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` initializes a list `l` of length \(10^7\) with all elements set to 0 and does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program state includes a list `l` of length \(10^7\) where every element is 0. There are no return values or further operations performed by the function. This means the function solely serves to create and initialize this list without any modifications or additional actions.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_3` does not use any of its intended parameters, and instead initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of \(10^7\). However, based on the problem description, no parameters are provided in the function signature, which is unusual given the context. The list initialization suggests it might be part of a larger solution or a helper function, but it doesn't directly relate to the problem's requirements.
def func_3():
    l = [(0) for i in range(10 ** 7)]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a list `l` containing \(10^7\) elements, each initialized to zero. The function does not perform any operations on the list or any other variables, and it does not modify the state of any external variables. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, as the list is simply initialized and returned without any further processing.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
