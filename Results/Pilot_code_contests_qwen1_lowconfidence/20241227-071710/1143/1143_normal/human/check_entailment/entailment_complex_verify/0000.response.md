Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The annotated version confirms that the `func_1` function attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but there are issues with the logic inside the nested loops. Specifically, the inner loop should iterate over the range of valid jumps from `i` to `i + k`, and the cost calculation should reflect the correct transition from `dp[i - j]` to `dp[i]`.

However, the annotations indicate that the `for` loop condition `if i - j > -1:` is problematic. This condition should be `if i - j >= 0:` to ensure that only valid indices are considered. Additionally, the logic for updating `dp[i]` does not correctly account for the minimum cost of reaching each stone. The annotations confirm that the logic inside the loops is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is maintained.
