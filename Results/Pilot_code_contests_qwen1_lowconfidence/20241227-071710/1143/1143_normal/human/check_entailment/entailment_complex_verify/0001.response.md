Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the program still contains logical flaws that prevent it from solving the problem correctly. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Dynamic Programming Approach**: The current implementation in `func_1` only considers jumps up to `i + k - 1` by iterating from `j = 1` to `j = k` and checking if `i - j > -1`. This means the frog can only jump to `i + 1`, `i + 2`, ..., `i + (k-1)`. However, the problem statement allows the frog to jump to any stone from `i + 1` to `i + k`, which means the loop should iterate from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to `i`.

2. **Uninitialized DP Array**: The `dp` array is initialized to `-1` for all indices, but it should be initialized to `float('inf')` to properly represent unvisited states. The original assessment noted this flaw, but the annotated version confirms that the `dp` array is indeed being initialized to `-1`, which leads to incorrect results when the optimal path involves multiple jumps from a single stone.

The corrected version of the function should look like this:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = read()
    arr = read()
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max(0, i - k + 1), i + 1):
            if dp[j] != float('inf'):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]))
    print(dp[-1])
```

This correction ensures that the frog can explore all valid jumps within the range `[i - k + 1, i]`, and the `dp` array is correctly initialized to represent unvisited states. Given these corrections, the program should now be able to solve the problem correctly.

However, since the original code was assessed as incorrect and the provided annotations confirm the presence of these flaws, the original assessment remains valid. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
