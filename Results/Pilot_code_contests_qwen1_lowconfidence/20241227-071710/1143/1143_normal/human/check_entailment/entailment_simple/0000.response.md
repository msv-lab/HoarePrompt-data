Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost for a frog to jump from Stone 1 to Stone N, where the cost of jumping from Stone `i` to Stone `j` is `|h_i - h_j|` and the frog can jump up to `K` stones at a time.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the inputs correctly: `n` (number of stones) and `k` (maximum jump distance), followed by the heights of the stones (`h_i`).

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost to reach each stone. It initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach stone `i`.
   - The outer loop iterates through each stone from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The inner loop considers all possible jumps from the current stone (up to `k` steps ahead).
   - For each possible jump, the program calculates the cost and updates the `dp` array if the new cost is lower.

4. **Initialization and Base Case**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to `-1` (indicating unvisited stones) except for `dp[0]` which is set to `0` (base case: starting at stone 1 with zero cost).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost to reach the last stone (`dp[n-1]`).

6. **Code Structure**:
   - Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are present, but only `func_1` is used in the main program. `func_2` and `func_3` do not seem to be relevant to solving the given problem and are likely helper functions or placeholders.

### Summary:
The provided program correctly follows the problem description by implementing the necessary logic using dynamic programming. It handles the constraints and input format as specified, ensuring that the output is the minimum possible total cost for the frog to reach the last stone. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
