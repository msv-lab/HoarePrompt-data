Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not work correctly for every potential case. Specifically, the code initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with a size of `n`, but it does not handle the case where the frog cannot reach Stone `N` from any of the previous stones within the range `i - j > -1`. The provided output hints do not mention this issue, but based on the problem description and the logic implemented, the code fails to handle scenarios where the frog cannot reach the next stone due to the constraints `1 ≤ i + j ≤ N`.

For example, consider the input:

```
5 3
10 30 40 50 60
```

In this case, the frog starts at Stone 1 and can jump to Stones 2, 3, or 4. From Stone 2, the frog can jump to Stones 3, 4, or 5. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the frog can reach Stone 5 if the heights do not allow it. For instance, if the heights were `[10, 100, 50, 50, 60]`, the frog would be unable to reach Stone 5 from Stone 2 or Stone 3 due to the large difference in heights, and the current implementation would not detect this and continue to update the `dp` array incorrectly.

Therefore, the code does not meet the specification for every potential case, leading to a failure in the correctness check.
