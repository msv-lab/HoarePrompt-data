Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. Despite the annotations, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Dynamic Programming Approach**: The original implementation in `func_1` starts the inner loop from `j = 1` to `k`, which means it only considers jumps of size 1 up to `k`. This is incorrect because the problem allows the frog to jump directly to `i + j` where `j` can be any value from 1 to `k`. The corrected version should start the inner loop from `max(0, i - k + 1)` to ensure all possible jumps are considered.

2. **Initialization and Update Logic**: The `dp` array is initialized with `-1` and updated based on the previous values. While the logic is close, the way the minimum cost is computed is flawed. The corrected version uses `float('inf')` for initialization and updates the `dp` array properly to ensure the minimum cost is calculated correctly.

3. **Annotations are Not Reflective of Correct Behavior**: The annotations describe a state where `dp[i]` is set based on previous values, but the actual implementation does not reflect this accurately due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment of `False` is maintained.
