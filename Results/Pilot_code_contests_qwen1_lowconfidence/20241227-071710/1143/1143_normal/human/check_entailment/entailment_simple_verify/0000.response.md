Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. Despite the addition of the annotated version, the core issue remains unchanged. The function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but the logic within the nested loops is flawed. Specifically, the loop should iterate over possible next stones from `i + 1` to `i + k`, not `i - j` to `i`. The current implementation incorrectly backtracks, leading to an incorrect computation of the minimum cost.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The inner loop should range from `1` to `k`, representing the possible jumps from stone `i` to stones `i+1` to `i+k`.
2. **Backtracking Issue**: The condition `if i - j > -1` is incorrect for forward jumps. It should simply check `if i + j < n`.

The annotated version does highlight the state of the program after each iteration, but it confirms that the logic within the loops is still flawed. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Given these points, the original assessment of the program being incorrect remains valid.
