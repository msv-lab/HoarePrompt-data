Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is flawed. The loop starts from `i` and tries to compute `dp[i]` using `dp[i-j]` where `j` ranges from 1 to `k`, which incorrectly limits the possible jumps. Additionally, the presence of unused functions `func_2` and `func_3` indicates that the developer was experimenting with different approaches, which could lead to confusion or incorrect implementation. The output hints for `func_3` do not impact the correctness of the main function, as it is unused. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
