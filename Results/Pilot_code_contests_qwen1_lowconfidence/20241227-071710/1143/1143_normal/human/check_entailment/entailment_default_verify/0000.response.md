Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The program contains only the definition of `func_1` and two incomplete functions (`func_2` and `func_3`). `func_1` reads the necessary inputs but does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost. Specifically, the nested loops do not properly handle the range of jumps allowed (i.e., from `i` to `i + K`). Additionally, even if `func_1` were correctly implemented, the presence of incomplete functions suggests that the program is not fully functional. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
