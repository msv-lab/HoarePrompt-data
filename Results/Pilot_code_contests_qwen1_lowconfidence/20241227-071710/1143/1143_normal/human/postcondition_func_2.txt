The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a list `l` containing \(10^7\) elements, each initialized to zero. The function does not perform any operations on the list or any other variables, and it does not modify the state of any external variables. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, as the list is simply initialized and returned without any further processing.
