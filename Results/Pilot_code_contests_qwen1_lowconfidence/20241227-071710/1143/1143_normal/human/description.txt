There are N stones, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), the height of Stone i is h_i.

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

* If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to one of the following: Stone i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, i + K. Here, a cost of |h_i - h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.



Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq 100
* 1 \leq h_i \leq 10^4

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
