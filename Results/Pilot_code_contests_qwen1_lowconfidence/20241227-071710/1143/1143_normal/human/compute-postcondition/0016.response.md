To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Initial States:
- `i` is an integer less than `n`
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is 1 initially

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `k`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The new value of `j` should be `k + 1` because the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration.

Since `j` starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, the loop will stop when `j` reaches `k + 1`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again after this point.

### Conclusion:
The loop will not execute one more time because `j` will reach `k + 1` and the loop will terminate. Thus, there are no adjustments needed to the states for the loop to execute one more time since it won't.

### Final Answer:
State: **No changes needed; the loop has terminated.**

However, if we were to consider the final state just before the loop terminates:

- `i` remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `arr` remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `dp` remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `k` remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `j` will be `k + 1`.

Since the loop is about to terminate, we can summarize the final state as follows:

State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1`**.
