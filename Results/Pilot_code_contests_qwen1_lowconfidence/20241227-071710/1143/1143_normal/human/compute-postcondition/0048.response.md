Postcondition: ***`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `dp[i]` is updated as follows: if `dp[i]` is -1, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i]); otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i]).***
