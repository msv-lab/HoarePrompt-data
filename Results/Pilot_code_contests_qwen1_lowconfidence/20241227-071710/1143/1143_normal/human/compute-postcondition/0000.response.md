The code initializes a list `l` with 10 million elements, each set to 0. This list is created within the scope of the function `func_3`, but since no parameters are provided in the function signature, this initialization is done within the context of the function itself. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **The function `func_3` initializes a list `l` with 10 million elements, each set to 0.**
