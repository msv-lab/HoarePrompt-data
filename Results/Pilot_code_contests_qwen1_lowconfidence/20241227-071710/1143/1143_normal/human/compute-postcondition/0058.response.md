According to the code, the loop condition is based on the variable `i`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

- `i` is an integer less than `n`
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `dp[i]` is the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0`. If no valid `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains `-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. This new value of `i` must still be less than `n` to satisfy the loop condition.

Let's summarize the new state:
- `i` is now `i + 1`, which is an integer less than `n`
- `n` remains a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` remains a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `dp[i]` (where `i` is now `i + 1`) will be updated based on the same rule as before: the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0`. If no valid `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains `-1`.

State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1]` is the minimum value among all possible `dp[i + 1 - j] + abs(arr[i + 1 - j] - arr[i + 1])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i + 1 - j >= 0`. If no valid `j` exists, `dp[i + 1]` remains `-1`.**
