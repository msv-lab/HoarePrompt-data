`tem` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Given the initial state, `j` is now 2. Since `dp[i]` could either remain `-1` or be updated based on the condition, its exact value is unknown, but it is not directly used in the calculation of `tem`. 

The calculation of `tem` depends on `dp[i - 2]` and `abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `j` is 2.
- `dp[i]` either remains `-1` or is updated based on the condition provided.
- `tem` is calculated as `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`.

Output State: **`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, `dp[i]` either remains `-1` or is updated based on the condition provided, `tem` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])**
