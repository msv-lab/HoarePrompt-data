Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is an integer less than `n`
   - `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
   - `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
   - `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
   - `j` is 1
   - `dp[i]` is updated according to the following rules:
     - If `i - j` is greater than -1, `tem` is set to `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and `dp[i]` is set to `tem` if `dp[i] == -1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `dp[i] <= tem`, or is updated to `tem` if `dp[i] > tem`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, k + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 1` and goes up to `j = k`.
   - After the first iteration (`j = 1`), `j` becomes 2.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged because the loop does not affect `i` directly.
   - The value of `dp[i]` may change based on the conditions provided in the problem statement, but we do not know the exact new value without seeing the loop body. However, the important point is that `dp[i]` is updated according to the rules provided.

5. **New State:**
   - `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `dp[i]` is potentially updated, but the exact value is unknown without seeing the loop body. However, we can say that `dp[i]` either remains `-1` or is updated based on the condition provided.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration (when `j` is 2) is:

State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1` or possibly updated, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**.
