`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. From the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`. Therefore, `dp[i]` will take on the value of `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`.

The values of `i`, `j`, `dp[i]` (which is now updated), and `tem` are affected. Since `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `tem` is defined in terms of `dp[i - 2]` and `arr`, we can directly update `dp[i]` based on these values.

Output State: **`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, `dp[i]` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i]), `tem` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])**.
