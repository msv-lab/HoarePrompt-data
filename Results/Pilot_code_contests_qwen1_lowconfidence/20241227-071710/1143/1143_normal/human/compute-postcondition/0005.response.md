State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1 initially**.

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The for loop starts with `j` set to 1 and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration until `j` is no longer less than `k + 1`.
2. **Initial Condition**: For the loop to start, `j` must be within the range from 1 to `k + 1`. Therefore, initially, `j` should be 1.
3. **Variables**: The initial conditions for `i`, `n`, `arr`, `dp`, and `k` remain as stated.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `j` must be 1 initially.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`.
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

The final state is:
State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1 initially**.
