`dp[0]` is assigned the value `0`. This means that the first element of the `dp` list is now `0`. The other elements of the `dp` list remain `-1` as they were initially. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**
