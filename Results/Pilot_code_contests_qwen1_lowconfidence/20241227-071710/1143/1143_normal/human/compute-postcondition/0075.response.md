Postcondition: ***`j` is `k + 1`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `dp[i]` is initially `-1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if it is greater than `dp[i - (k + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (k + 1)] - arr[i])`; otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - (k + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (k + 1)] - arr[i])`.***
