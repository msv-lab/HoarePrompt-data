The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given that `tem` is defined as `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`, this value is now assigned to `dp[i]`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `dp[i]`, and `tem`) are updated as per the assignment.

Output State: **`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, `dp[i]` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i]), `tem` is `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])**.
