Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `-1 + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`, `dp[i]` is not equal to -1, and the value of `dp[i]` is greater than `tem`.***
