The code assigns the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` to the variable `tem`. 

- `j` is defined as `k + 2`.
- `i` is an integer less than `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`.
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

Since the values of `dp[i - j]` and `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` are not specified, we express `tem` in terms of these variables. The value of `dp[i - j]` is either 0 (if `i - j` is 0) or -1 (if `i - j` is not 0). The value of `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`j` is `k + 2`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
