The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. From the initial state, we know that `tem` is defined as `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i])`. Since `dp[i]` is being updated based on this value, the output state will reflect this change.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, `tem` is `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i])`, and `dp[i]` is now equal to `tem`.

Output State: **`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, `tem` is `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i])`, and `dp[i]` is equal to `tem`.**
