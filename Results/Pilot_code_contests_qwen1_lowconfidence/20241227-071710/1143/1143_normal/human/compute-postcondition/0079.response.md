`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`, which is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The value of `j` is `k + 2`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, and `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

The output state will reflect that `dp[i]` has been updated to `tem`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`j` is `k + 2`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i] = tem`**
