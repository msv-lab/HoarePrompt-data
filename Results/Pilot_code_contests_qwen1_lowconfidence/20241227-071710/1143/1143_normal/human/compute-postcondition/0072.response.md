The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. According to the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Therefore, `dp[i]` is updated to this value.

Output State: **`j` is `k + 1`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[i] = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `tem` is no longer a variable as it was used in the assignment.**
