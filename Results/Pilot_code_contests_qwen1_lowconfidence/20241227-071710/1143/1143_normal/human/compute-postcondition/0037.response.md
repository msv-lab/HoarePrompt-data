Postcondition: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `i - j` is greater than -1, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]), and dp[i] is not -1**
