`tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Given the initial state, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, and `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k`.

Since the code does not modify `i`, `n`, `arr`, `dp`, `k`, or `j`, only `tem` is updated. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `tem`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k`, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.**
