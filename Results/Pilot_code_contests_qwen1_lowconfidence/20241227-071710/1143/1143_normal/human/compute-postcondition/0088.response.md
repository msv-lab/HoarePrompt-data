Functionality: **The function processes an array `arr` of length `n` where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\), and finds the minimum cost to reach the end of the array using a sliding window approach. The cost to move from index `i-j` to index `i` is defined as `abs(arr[i-j] - arr[i])`. The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[0] = 0` and each subsequent element is the minimum cost to reach that index from any previous index within a distance `k`. After executing the function, the state of the program will be that `dp[-1]` contains the minimum cost to reach the last index of `arr`. If no valid path is found (i.e., all `dp` values remain -1), `dp[-1]` will still be -1. The function does not return any value.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `k` is 1, the function will only consider the immediate previous index for cost calculation.
- If `k` is larger than `n`, the function will effectively ignore the `k` constraint and use all previous indices for cost calculation.
- If `n` is 1 (i.e., the array has only one element), `dp` will have only one element set to 0, and `dp[-1]` will be 0.

Missing Functionality:
- The code does not handle the case where `dp[i]` is never updated because all previous values are -1. In such a scenario, `dp[-1]` would still be -1, indicating that no valid path was found.
