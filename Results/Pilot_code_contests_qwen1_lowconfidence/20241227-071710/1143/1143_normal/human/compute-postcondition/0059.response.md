Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `i` is an integer less than `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer (at least 1).
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
   - `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`.
   - `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `dp[i + 1]` is the minimum value among all possible `dp[i + 1 - j] + abs(arr[i + 1 - j] - arr[i + 1])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i + 1 - j >= 0`. If no valid `j` exists, `dp[i + 1]` remains `-1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(1, k + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop runs for values of `j` from 1 to `k`.
   - For each `j`, the loop body updates `dp[i + 1]` based on the condition provided.

4. **Determining the Necessary States:**
   - The loop body will execute as long as `j` is within the specified range (1 to `k`).
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` itself, ensuring it starts within the range 1 to `k`.

5. **Adjusted State:**
   - `j` must be initialized to 1 (the start of the range) before entering the loop.
   - All other states (`i`, `n`, `arr`, `dp`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the loop initialization.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**.
