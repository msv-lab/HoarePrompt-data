Postcondition: ***`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, `tem` is `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i])`. If `dp[i]` is -1, then `dp[i]` is set to `tem`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `tem` if `dp[i]` is greater than `tem`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
