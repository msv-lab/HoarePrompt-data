Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k`, `dp[i]` is determined as follows: 
- If `dp[i]` is initially `-1`, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i - k] + abs(arr[i - k] - arr[i])`.
- If `dp[i]` is not `-1`, then `dp[i]` is either `dp[i - k] + abs(arr[i - k] - arr[i])` or `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, whichever is greater.***
