`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. Given that `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and knowing that `j` is equal to `k`, the updated value for `dp[i]` is `dp[i - k] + abs(arr[i - k] - arr[i])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k`, `dp[i]` is `dp[i - k] + abs(arr[i - k] - arr[i])`.**
