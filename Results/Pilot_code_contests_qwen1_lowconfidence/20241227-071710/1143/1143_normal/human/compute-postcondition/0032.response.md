Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement to determine the necessary adjustments.

Given:
- `i` is an integer less than `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`.
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

The for loop statement:
```
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k`.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `j` should be 1.
   
2. **Variable `k`:**
   - `k` is used as the upper bound of the range function in the for loop.
   - Since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1.
   - Hence, no change is needed for `k`.

3. **Other Variables (`i`, `n`, `arr`, `dp`):**
   - These variables do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given loop statement.
   - However, they are part of the overall state and may be modified within the loop, but they do not need adjustment for the loop to start executing.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `j` to its starting value, which is 1. No other changes are required for the existing variables.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
