Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `i - j > -1`, then `dp[i]` is updated such that if `dp[i] == -1`, it is set to `-1 + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged. No changes occur if `i - j \leq -1`.***
