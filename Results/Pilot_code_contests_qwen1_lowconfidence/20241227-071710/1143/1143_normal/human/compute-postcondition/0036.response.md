The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. The value of `tem` is given as `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `i - j` is greater than -1, the value of `i` and `j` are such that this condition holds true. Also, `tem` is calculated based on the current values of `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `dp[i]` is now set to `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`
- All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `i - j` is greater than -1, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]), and `dp[i]` is now set to `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`**
