The code initializes `tem` with the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Given that `j` is 3, this translates to `tem = dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i])`.

Let's update the relevant variables:

- `tem` is assigned the value of `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i])`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- The value of `j` remains 3.
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated based on its previous value (if -1) or the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`.

Since the exact values of `dp[i - 3]`, `arr[i - 3]`, and `arr[i]` are not provided, we express `tem` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, `tem` is `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i]),` and `dp[i]` is updated based on its previous value (if -1) or the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i]).**
