Postcondition: ***`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3. If `i - j > -1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i])` if `dp[i]` is -1 or `dp[i]` is greater than `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
