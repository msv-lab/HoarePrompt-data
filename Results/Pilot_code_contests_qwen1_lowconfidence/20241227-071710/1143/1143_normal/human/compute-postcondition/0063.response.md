The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given that `tem` is defined as `-1 + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to this expression. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `j` is 1
- `i` is an integer less than `n`
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- The current value of `i - j` is greater than -1
- `tem` is `-1 + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`
- The current value of `dp[i]` is now `tem`

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the current value of `i - j` is greater than -1, `tem` is `-1 + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`, and `dp[i]` is `tem**.
