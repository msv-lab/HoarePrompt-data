The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided information, the function initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of \(10^7\). Given that no parameters are provided in the function signature and the list initialization seems unrelated to the expected behavior described in the problem, the function simply creates and returns this list.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of zeros with a length of \(10^7\).**
