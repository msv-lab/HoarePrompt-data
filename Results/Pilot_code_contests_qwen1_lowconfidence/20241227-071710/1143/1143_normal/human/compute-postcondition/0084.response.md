Output State: **`j` is `k + 1`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `i - j > -1`, then `dp[i]` is updated such that if `dp[i] == -1`, it is set to the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0`. If `dp[i]` is not initially `-1`, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged if it is greater than the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0`; otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to that minimum value. There is no change in `j`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, or `k`.**
