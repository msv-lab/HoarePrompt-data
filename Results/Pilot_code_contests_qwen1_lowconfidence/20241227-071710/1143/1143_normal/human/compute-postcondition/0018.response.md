`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. According to the initial state, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Since `j` is `k + 1`, we substitute `j` with `k + 1`. Therefore, `tem` becomes `dp[i - (k + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (k + 1)] - arr[i])`.

The values of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`tem` is `dp[i - (k + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (k + 1)] - arr[i])`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1`, and `dp[i]` is now equal to `tem`.**
