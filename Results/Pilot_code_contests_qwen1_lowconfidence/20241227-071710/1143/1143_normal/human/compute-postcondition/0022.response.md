Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1`. If `i - j > -1`, then `tem` is `dp[i - (k + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (k + 1)] - arr[i])`. If `dp[i] == -1`, then `dp[i]` is set to `tem`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `dp[i] > tem`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
