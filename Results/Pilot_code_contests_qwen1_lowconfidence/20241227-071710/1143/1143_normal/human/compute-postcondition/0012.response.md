`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. Given that `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated accordingly. Since `j` is initially 1, `i - j` is `i - 1`. The precondition that `dp[i]` is greater than `tem` is no longer valid since `dp[i]` is now set to `tem`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1 initially, and `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - 1] + abs(arr[i - 1] - arr[i]), dp[i] is equal to `tem'.**
