The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `j` is `k + 2`
- `i` is an integer less than `n`
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `tem = dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`

After executing the line `dp[i] = tem`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to `tem`, which is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `j` remains `k + 2`
- `i` remains an integer less than `n`
- `n` remains a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp[0]` remains `0`
- The rest of the elements in `dp` remain `-1`, except for `dp[i]` which is now `tem`
- `k` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `tem` is no longer relevant as it has been assigned to `dp[i]`

Output State: **`j` is `k + 2`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp[0]` is `0`, the rest of the elements in `dp` are `-1` except for `dp[i]` which is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]), `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
