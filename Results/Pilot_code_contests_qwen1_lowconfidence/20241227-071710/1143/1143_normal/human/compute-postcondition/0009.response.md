The code `dp[i] = tem` assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. From the initial state, `tem` is calculated as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and since `dp[0] = 0` and the rest of the `dp` elements are `-1`, `dp[i - j]` is `-1`. Therefore, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.

Given that `i - j` is greater than -1, `dp[i - j]` is `-1`, and `dp[i]` is updated to this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1 initially, `i - j` is greater than -1, `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, and `dp[i]` is `tem`.**
