`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. From the initial state, `tem` is defined as `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i])`. Since no further changes are made to `dp[i]` after this assignment, and no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output state will include the updated value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, `tem` is `dp[i - 3] + abs(arr[i - 3] - arr[i]),` and `dp[i]` is `tem`.**
