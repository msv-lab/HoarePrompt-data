The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the given constraints and relationships, it seems the function relies on global variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `dp`.

- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4 for all 0 <= i < n.
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers initialized to -1 except `dp[0]` which is set to 0.

The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to operate on the global variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `dp` without returning any value.

Functionality: **The function operates on global variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `dp` without returning any value.**
