Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `i` is an integer less than `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`.
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is `k + 1`.
- If `i - j > -1`, then `tem` is `dp[i - (k + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (k + 1)] - arr[i])`.
- If `dp[i] == -1`, then `dp[i]` is set to `tem`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `dp[i] > tem`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State:
- `i` is an integer less than `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`.
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is `k + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: At the start of the first iteration, `j` is `k + 1`.
3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must decrease from `k + 1` to `1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State of `j`**: `j` is `k + 1`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased to `k`, then `k - 1`, and so on until it reaches `1`.

Since the loop decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration, we can conclude that `j` will be `k` at the start of the next iteration.

### New State:
- `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same.
- `arr` remains the same.
- `dp` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `j` decreases to `k`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k`**.
