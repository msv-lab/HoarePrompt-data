`tem` is assigned the value `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `i - j` is greater than -1, which means `i - j` is a valid index in the lists `dp` and `arr`.
- `dp[0] = 0` and the rest of `dp` are `-1`.
- Each element in `arr` is between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `j` is 1.

Therefore, `dp[i - j]` is `-1` because `i - j` is not 0 (since `i` is an integer less than `n` and `n` is a positive integer). The value of `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` is the absolute difference between `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]`.

The updated state of the variables is:
- `tem` is assigned the value `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`.
- All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i]).**
