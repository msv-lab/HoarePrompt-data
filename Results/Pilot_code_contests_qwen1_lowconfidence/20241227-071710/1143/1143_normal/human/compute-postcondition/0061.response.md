The code assigns the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` to the variable `tem`. Since `dp[i - j]` and `arr[i - j]`, `arr[i]` are part of the initial state, we can use their values to determine `tem`.

- `dp[i - j]` is initially `-1` because all elements in `dp` except `dp[0]` are initialized to `-1`.
- `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` calculates the absolute difference between the elements at indices `i - j` and `i` in the list `arr`.

So, `tem` is calculated as:
\[ tem = -1 + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]| \]

The output state is:
**`j` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `-1 + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`.**
