Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `k + 1`
   - `i` is an integer less than `n`
   - `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
   - `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
   - `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
   - No changes to `j`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, or `k` are mentioned.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k + 1`.

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The value of `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `k + 1`.
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 1`, and the condition given in the postcondition is that `j` is `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, this means `j` has reached its upper limit and the loop will stop after this iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented from `k + 1` to `k + 2` (which would be out of the loop's range).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `j` is `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, so after the loop, `j` will be `k + 2` (but the loop will stop).
   - `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `dp` remains unchanged as per the postcondition since there was no update mentioned in the loop body for the current values of `i` and `j`.

Given these points, we can summarize the states as follows:

**State: **`j` is `k + 2`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
