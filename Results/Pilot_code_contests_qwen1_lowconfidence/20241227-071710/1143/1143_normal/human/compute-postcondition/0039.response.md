`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `tem`. From the given information, `tem` is defined as `-1 + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`. Since `j` is 1, `i - j` is `i - 1`. Therefore, `tem` can be expressed as `-1 + abs(arr[i - 1] - arr[i])`.

The other variables remain unchanged. So, the updated states are:

- `i` is an integer less than `n`
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is 1
- `i - j` is greater than -1
- `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - 1] - arr[i])`
- `dp[i]` is now equal to `tem`

Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`; `n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive; `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`; `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 1; `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `-1 + abs(arr[i - 1] - arr[i]); `dp[i]` is equal to `-1 + abs(arr[i - 1] - arr[i])`.**
