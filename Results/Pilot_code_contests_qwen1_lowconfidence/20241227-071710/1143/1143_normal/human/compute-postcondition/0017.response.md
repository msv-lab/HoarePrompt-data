The code assigns the value of `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` to `tem`. Let's break this down:

1. `i - j` is an index in the lists `dp` and `arr`.
2. Since `j` is `k + 1`, `i - j` is an integer less than `i` and since `i` is less than `n`, `i - j` is also a valid index for both `dp` and `arr`.
3. `dp[i - j]` is the value at the `(i - j)`-th index of the `dp` list.
4. `arr[i - j]` and `arr[i]` are the values at the `(i - j)`-th and `i`-th indices of the `arr` list respectively.
5. `abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` calculates the absolute difference between the values at these two indices.

The value of `tem` is calculated based on these values, but since the exact values of `dp[i - j]`, `arr[i - j]`, and `arr[i]` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `tem`. However, we know that `tem` is assigned the result of this calculation.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `tem`.

Output State: **`tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1`**
