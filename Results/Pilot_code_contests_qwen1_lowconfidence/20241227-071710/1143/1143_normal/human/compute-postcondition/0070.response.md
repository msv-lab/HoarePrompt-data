To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and loop:

### Initial Conditions:
- `j` is 1
- `i` is an integer less than `n`
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs from `j` in the range `1` to `k + 1`.

### Key Points:
- The loop increments `j` starting from 1 up to `k + 1`.
- Each iteration updates the `dp` list based on the value of `i` and the condition `i - j > -1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State (`j = 1`)**:
   - `j` starts at 1.
   - The loop will run from `j = 1` to `j = k + 1`.

2. **End of Previous Iteration (`j = k`)**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `k`.
   - The next value of `j` will be `k + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.
- The other variables (`i`, `n`, `arr`, `dp`, `k`) remain unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop.

### Final State:
- `j` is now `k + 1`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`j` is `k + 1`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**

This is the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.
