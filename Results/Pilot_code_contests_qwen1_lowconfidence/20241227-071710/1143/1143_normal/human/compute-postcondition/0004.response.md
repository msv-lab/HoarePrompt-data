To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the conditions required for the loop to start.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from input.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to start executing, `i` must be less than `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - Since `i` starts at `0` and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1) for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **List `arr`:**
   - The list `arr` must have exactly `n` elements, and each element must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

4. **List `dp`:**
   - The list `dp` must have `n` elements, with `dp[0] = 0` and all other elements initialized to `-1`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The variables `n` and `k` are not directly involved in the loop condition, but they should be properly defined before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `n` must be a positive integer (at least 1).
- `arr` must be a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `dp` must be a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`**.
