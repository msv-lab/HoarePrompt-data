The code assigns the value of `tem` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `j` is `k + 1`
- `i` is an integer less than `n`
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`

The only variable that changes is `dp[i]`, which gets assigned the value of `tem`. Since `tem` is defined as `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])`, we can update the `dp` list accordingly.

Output State: **`j` is `k + 1`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i]` is `dp[i - (k + 1)] + abs(arr[i - (k + 1)] - arr[i])`, `tem` is `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])**
