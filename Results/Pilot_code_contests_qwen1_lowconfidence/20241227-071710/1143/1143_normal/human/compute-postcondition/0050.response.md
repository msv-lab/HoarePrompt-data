According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates from `1` to `k + 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3. Therefore, `j` must be less than `k + 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we'll express the condition in terms of `k`.

State: **`i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated as follows: if `dp[i]` is -1, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i])`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 2] + abs(arr[i - 2] - arr[i]).**
