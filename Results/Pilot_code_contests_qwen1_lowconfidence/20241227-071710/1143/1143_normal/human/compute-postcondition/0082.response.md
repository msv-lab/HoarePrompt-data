Postcondition: **`j` is `k + 2`, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `dp[i] == -1`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `tem`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
