The code snippet sets `dp[i]` to the value of `tem`. Based on the initial state, `tem` is defined as `-1 + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`. Since `dp[i]` is not equal to -1 and its current value is greater than `tem`, this assignment will overwrite the existing value of `dp[i]` with `tem`.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`j` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `i - j` is greater than -1; `tem` is `-1 + |arr[i - j] - arr[i]|`, `dp[i]` is now equal to `tem`.**
