Output State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, for every `j` in the range `[1, k]`, if `i - j > -1`, then `dp[i]` is the minimum value among `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all valid `j`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains `-1`.**
