Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are either the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0` or `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables `i` and `n`:** After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n` because the outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` will reach `n` after all iterations.
- **Variable `arr`:** The list `arr` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is only read from but not modified.
- **Variable `dp`:** For each index `i` in the list `dp`, the value is updated based on the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0`. If no valid `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains `-1`. This means that after the loop completes, `dp[i]` for each `i` will hold the minimum cost to reach that position in the array starting from `dp[0]` with steps of `k`.
- **Variable `k`:** The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is only used as an upper bound for the inner loop and is not modified within the loop.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, `dp` will contain the minimum cost to reach each index `i` from the start (`dp[0] = 0`) using steps of `k`, with `-1` indicating that no valid path exists.
