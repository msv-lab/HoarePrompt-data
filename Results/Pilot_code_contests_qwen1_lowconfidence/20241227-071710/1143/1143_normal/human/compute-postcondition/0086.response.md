The code `print(dp[-1])` prints the last element of the `dp` list. This operation does not change the values of any variables; it only accesses the value of `dp[-1]` and outputs it. Therefore, the `dp` list remains unchanged, and the value of `dp[-1]` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are either the minimum value among all possible `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all `j` from 1 to `k` such that `i - j >= 0` or `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `dp[-1]` is the value computed as per the given formula.**
