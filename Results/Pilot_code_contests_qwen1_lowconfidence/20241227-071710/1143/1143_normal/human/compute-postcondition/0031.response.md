Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine the necessary adjustments for the state before the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `i` is an integer less than `n`
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- For every `j` in the range `[1, k]`, if `i - j > -1`, then `dp[i]` is the minimum value among `dp[i - j] + abs(arr[i - j] - arr[i])` for all valid `j`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains `-1`.

### Current Value at the End of Previous Iteration
- `i` is some integer less than `n`
- The exact value of `i` is not specified, but it is less than `n`
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1

### Loop Execution
The loop will increment `i` by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will become `i + 1`

### Condition for Loop Continuation
The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

### Updated State Before Next Iteration
Given that `i` was previously less than `n`, after incrementing `i` by 1, we need to ensure `i` is still within the valid range for the next iteration.

- `i` becomes `i + 1`
- Since `i` was initially less than `n`, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State
State: **`i` is an integer less than or equal to `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**

However, since `i` must be strictly less than `n` for the loop to continue, we adjust the state to:

State: **`i` is an integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0] = 0` and the rest are `-1`, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
