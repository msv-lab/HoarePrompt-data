The function `func_3` does not use any of its intended parameters, and instead initializes a list `l` of zeros with a length of \(10^7\). However, based on the problem description, no parameters are provided in the function signature, which is unusual given the context. The list initialization suggests it might be part of a larger solution or a helper function, but it doesn't directly relate to the problem's requirements.
