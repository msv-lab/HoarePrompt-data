`z` is incremented by `p1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `p1`, and `to` are unknown, we can only express the updated value of `z` in terms of these unknowns. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`z` is `z + (p1 - to)`, `p1` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
