The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])` impacts the program by assigning the value of the leftmost insertion point of `l[1]` in the sorted list `r` to the variable `to`. 

- The initial state is that `j` is `len(q) - 1`, `q` must have at least one element, `l` is `[p[i], q[j]]`, `to` is unchanged, `isTrue` is unchanged, and `z` is unchanged.
- `l[1]` is `q[j]`, which is the last element of `q`.
- The function `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])` finds the index in the sorted list `r` where `l[1]` can be inserted without violating the order. Since the exact content of `r` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `to`, but we know it will be the index of the first element in `r` that is not less than `q[j]`.

Therefore, the updated state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`j` is `len(q) - 1`, `q` must have at least one element, `l` is `[p[i], q[j]]`, `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is not less than `q[j]`, `isTrue` is unchanged, `z` is unchanged**
