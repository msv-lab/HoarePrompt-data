`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. This means `n` is now an integer obtained from user input, but the exact value is not specified in the initial state. The length of the string `S` remains unchanged and is still `N`, which is between 1 and 4000. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `n` is an integer input from the user.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `n` is an integer input from the user.**
