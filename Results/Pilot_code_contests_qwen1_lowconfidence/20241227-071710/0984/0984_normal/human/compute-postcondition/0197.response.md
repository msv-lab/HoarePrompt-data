`z` is incremented by `p1 - to`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[j + 1])`, and `isTrue` is calculated as `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[j + 1])`, `isTrue` is calculated as `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, and `z` is increased by `p1 - to`.**
