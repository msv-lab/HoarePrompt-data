`z` is incremented by `q1 - to`. Since the initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, the only change in the state is that `z` is now `z + (q1 - to)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`z` is `z + (q1 - to)`, `q1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
