`z` is incremented by `q1 - to`. The values of `i`, `j`, `l`, `to`, `isTrue`, `z`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `i_current + 2`, `j` is 1, `l` is `[i_current + 2, r1]`, `to` is the index where `r1` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the value of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r1 - (i_current + 2))`, `z` is `z + (q1 - to)`, and `r` must have at least 1 element.**
