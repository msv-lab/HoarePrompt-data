Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is `i_current + 2`.
   - `j` is `2`.
   - `l` is `[p[i_current + 2], r[2]]`.
   - `to` is the index where `r[2]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order.
   - `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[2] - p[i_current + 2])`.
   - `z` is unchanged.
   - `r` must have at least 1 element.

2. **Try Block**:
   - The code checks if `q[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`.
   - If the condition is false, `z` is incremented by `q1 - to`.

3. **Except Block**:
   - If an exception occurs (which is caught by the general `except` clause), `z` is incremented by `q1 - to`.

4. **Exception Occurrence**:
   - An exception could occur if `q[to:]` is empty when trying to access `q[to:][isTrue]`.
   - This would happen if `to` equals the length of `q` (i.e., `len(q)`) and `isTrue` is within the valid range but accessing an empty slice would still raise an `IndexError`.

5. **Summary of Accomplishments**:
   - The `try` block attempts to update `z` based on whether a specific condition involving elements from arrays `q`, `p`, and `r` is met.
   - The `except` block ensures that `z` is still incremented even if an exception occurs, using the value of `q1 - to`.

6. **Final Output State**:
   - `i` is `i_current + 2`.
   - `j` is `2`.
   - `l` is `[p[i_current + 2], r[2]]`.
   - `to` is the index where `r[2]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order.
   - `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[2] - p[i_current + 2])`.
   - `z` is updated according to the condition or incremented by `q1 - to` if an exception occurs.
   - `r` must have at least 1 element.

Output State: **`i` is `i_current + 2`, `j` is `2`, `l` is `[p[i_current + 2], r[2]]`, `to` is the index where `r[2]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[2] - p[i_current + 2])`, `z` is updated by adding `(q1 - to - 1)` if `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true, otherwise it is updated by adding `(q1 - to)` or `q1 - to` if an exception occurs, and `r` must have at least 1 element.**
