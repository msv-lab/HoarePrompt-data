The code `z += p1 - to` means that `z` is updated by adding the value of `p1 - to` to its current value. However, since the initial state is unknown for `z`, `p1`, and `to`, we cannot determine their specific values or expressions. Therefore, the only change in the output state will be the modification of `z`.

Output State: **`z` is updated by adding `p1 - to` to its current value, `p1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
