Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `j` is `j + 1` (which means `j` is incremented by 1)
   - `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j + 1]`
   - `to` and `isTrue` are recalculated
   - `z` is updated by `z + (p1 - to)`

2. Code Execution:
   - `to = bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])`
     - This line finds the index in the list `p` where the element `l[1]` can be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order.
     - Since `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j + 1]`, `l[1]` is `r[j + 1]`.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `j` is already incremented by 1 in the initial state, so it remains the same after this line.
   - `l` is unchanged because it is read-only in this line.
   - `to` is updated to the index where `r[j + 1]` can be inserted in `p` to maintain the sorted order.
   - `isTrue` and `z` are not directly affected by this line, so they remain as recalculated from their previous state.

4. New Values:
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[j + 1])`.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1; `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[j + 1])`; `isTrue` and `z` are recalculated.**
