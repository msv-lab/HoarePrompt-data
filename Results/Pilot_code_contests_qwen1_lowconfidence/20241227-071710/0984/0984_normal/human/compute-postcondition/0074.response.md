`z` is incremented by the value of `r1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, the only information we can provide is that `z` has been updated to its current value plus `r1 - to`.

Output State: **the state is unknown, but `z` is updated to its current value plus `r1 - to`**
