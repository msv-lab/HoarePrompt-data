Postcondition: ***`l` is `[q[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain order (now updated), `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1` if `p[to + isTrue]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, otherwise `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`, and `j` is `j + 1`.***

In this case, since the postconditions for both the if and else parts are identical, the overall postcondition simply combines the common elements from both postconditions without additional changes due to the if-else condition.
