Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\)
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`. For example, if `s = "abcda"`, then `d['a'] = [0, 4]`, `d['b'] = [1]`, `d['c'] = [2]`.
- `i` is the next index after the last processed index, which is `i + 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(s)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the string `s`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next index after the last processed index, which means it is currently `len(s)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range of `range(len(s))`, meaning `i < len(s)`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since `i` is currently `len(s)`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be set to `0` (the first index of the string `s`).
- The length of the string `s` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
- `N` remains the same since it is not directly involved in the loop.
- `s` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
- `d` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
- `i` is reset to `0` for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\), `s` is a non-empty string, `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`, `i` is 0**.
