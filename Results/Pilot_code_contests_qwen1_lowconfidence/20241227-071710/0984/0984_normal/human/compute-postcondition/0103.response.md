`z` is incremented by `r1 - to`. However, the values of `r1`, `to`, and the other variables (`j`, `l`, `isTrue`) are not specified in the initial state. We only know that `z` is incremented by the difference between `r1` and `to`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `l` is [a, b], `to` is the index in `r` where `b` would fit according to the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2b - a` would fit according to the sorted order, `z` is increased by `r1 - to`.**
