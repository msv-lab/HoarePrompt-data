`z` is incremented by `q1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, the only information we can provide is that `z` is updated to its current value plus `q1 - to`. Therefore, the output state includes this update.

Output State: **`z` is updated to its current value + `q1 - to`**
