The code appends the current index `i` to the list corresponding to the character `s[i]` in the dictionary `d`. The initial state is as follows:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\)
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`
- `i` is the next index after the last processed index

The code `d[s[i]].append(i)` will add the value of `i` to the list in `d` that corresponds to the character `s[i]`. Since `i` is the next index after the last processed index, it means `i` is one more than the last index processed.

Given this, the only change is to the dictionary `d`. The Output State is:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\)
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`, with the additional entry that the character `s[i]` now has its index `i` appended to its list
- `i` is the next index after the last processed index, which is `i+1`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\), `s` is a non-empty string, `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s` with the character `s[i]` having its index `i` appended to its list, `i` is the next index after the last processed index which is `i+1`.**
