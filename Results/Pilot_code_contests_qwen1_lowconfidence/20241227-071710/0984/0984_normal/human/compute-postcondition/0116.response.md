Output State: **`j` is the length of `q`, `l` is the last value of `[p[i+1], q[-1]]` or `[q[-1], p[i+1]]` sorted, `to` is the index in `r` where `l[1]` would fit according to the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would fit according to the sorted order, `z` is the sum of all increments made during the loop iterations, `r` is the final sorted list of `l[1]` values, `q` is the list from which elements were taken, `r1` is the length of `r`, and `s`, `N`, and `d` retain their original values.**
