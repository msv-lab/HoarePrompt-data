`to` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence in the list `q` where an element is not less than `l[1]`. The value of `l[1]` is `[p[i], r[j]]`. The other variables are not affected. 

Since the exact values of `p[i]`, `r[j]`, and `q` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `to`. However, we know that `to` will be an integer representing the index in `q` where the condition holds true.

Output State: **`j` is `len_r + 1`, `r` must have at least `len_r + 1` elements, `l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index of the first occurrence in `q` where an element is not less than `[p[i], r[j]]**.
