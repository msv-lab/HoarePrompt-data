`z` is incremented by the value of `r1 - to - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `r1`, `to`, and `isTrue` are involved in the calculation, we express the updated value of `z` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`to` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p, qj)`, `p` is a list of indices where 'R' appears in `s`, `q` is a non-empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`, `l` is a sorted list containing the `i`-th element of `p` and the `j`-th element of `q`, `isTrue` is the index where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in the list `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, and `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`.**
