Output State: **`j` is 0, `l` is either `[p[i], q[j]]` or `[q[j], p[i]]`, `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is not less than `l[1]`, `isTrue` is the index of the first element in `r[to:]` that is not less than `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, and `z` is updated to either `z + (r1 - to - 1)` or `z + (r1 - to)` depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true or false.**
