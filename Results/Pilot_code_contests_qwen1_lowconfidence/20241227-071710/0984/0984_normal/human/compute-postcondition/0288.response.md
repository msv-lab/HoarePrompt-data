The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])` impacts the variable `to` by assigning it the index where `l[1]` should be inserted in the list `q` to maintain the sorted order. Given the initial state, `l` is a list `[i_current + 2, r1]` (sorted), so `l[1]` is `r1`. 

The output state after this code is executed is:
- `i` remains `i_current + 2`
- `j` remains 1
- `l` remains `[i_current + 2, r1]`
- `to` is assigned the value of the index where `r1` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order
- `isTrue` remains the value calculated from the previous state
- `z` remains unchanged from the previous state unless modified in the `try` or `except` blocks, but since no such modification is shown here, it remains the same
- `r` must still have at least 1 element

Output State: **`i` is `i_current + 2`, `j` is 1, `l` is `[i_current + 2, r1]`, `to` is the index where `r1` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the value calculated previously, `z` is unchanged, and `r` must have at least 1 element.**
