The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but presumably processes the string `S` and the integer `N`. However, based on the provided constraints and the format required, we should state the expected types and behavior clearly.

Given the constraints, the function likely accepts two parameters: `N` (an integer) and `S` (a string). The functionality involves processing these parameters where `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'. 

Output cases are not explicitly provided, so we focus on the input parameters.
