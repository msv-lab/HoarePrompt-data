The code assigns the value of `len(p)` to `p1`. This means `p1` will store the length of the list `p`, which contains all the indices where 'R' appears in the string `s`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`; `p` is the list of indices where 'R' appears in `s`; `q` is the list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`; `r` is the list of indices where 'B' appears in `s`; `p1` is the length of the list `p`**.
