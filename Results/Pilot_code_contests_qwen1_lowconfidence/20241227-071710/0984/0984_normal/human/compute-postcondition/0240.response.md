The code snippet `z += q1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding the result of `q1 - to` to its current value. However, since the initial state of the variables `z`, `q1`, and `to` is unknown, we cannot specify their exact values in the output state.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `z` and the unchanged states of `q1` and `to`.

Output State: **`z` is updated to its current value plus `q1 - to`, `q1` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
