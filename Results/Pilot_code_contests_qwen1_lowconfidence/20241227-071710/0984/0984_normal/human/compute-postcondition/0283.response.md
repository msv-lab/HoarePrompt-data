Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_current + 2`, `j` is 0, `l` is `[p[i], r[0]]`, `to` is the index where `r[0]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[0] - p[i])`, `z` is updated as follows: if the condition `(q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0])` is true, then `z` is increased by `(q1 - to - 1)`. Otherwise, `z` is increased by `q1 - to`, and `r` must have at least 1 element.***
