Postcondition: `to` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p, qj)`, `p` is a list of indices where 'R' appears in `s`, `q` is a non-empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`, `l` is a sorted list containing the `i`-th element of `p` and the `j`-th element of `q`, `isTrue` is an index, and `r[to:]` does not contain the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
