`z` is incremented by `q1 - to - 1`. The value of `q1 - to - 1` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `q1 - to - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `len_r + 1`, `r` must have at least `len_r + 1` elements, `l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index of the first occurrence in `q` where an element is not less than `[p[i], r[j]]`, `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where `2 * r[j] - p[i]` would be inserted to maintain order, `z` is increased by `q1 - to - 1`.**
