`z` is incremented by `r1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, the exact numerical value of `z` cannot be determined. The only change is that `z` is now `z + (r1 - to)`.

Output State: **`z` is `z + (r1 - to)`, `r1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
