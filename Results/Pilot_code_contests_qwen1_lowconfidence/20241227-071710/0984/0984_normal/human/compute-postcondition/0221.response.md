Postcondition: ***`l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the sorted list `q` without disturbing its order, `isTrue` is the index at which `2 * r[j] - p[i]` is to be inserted into `q[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, `z` is updated as follows: if `q[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is increased by `q1 - to - 1`; otherwise, `z` is updated by adding `q1 - to` to its previous value.***
