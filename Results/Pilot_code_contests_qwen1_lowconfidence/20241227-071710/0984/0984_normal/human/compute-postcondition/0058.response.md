`to` is assigned the value of the leftmost index where the value of `l[1]` can be inserted into the list `r` to maintain the sorted order. The value of `l[1]` is `q[len(q) - 1]`. The values of `j`, `q`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `len(q) - 1`; `q` must have at least one element; `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[len(q) - 1]]`; `to` is the leftmost index in `r` where `q[len(q) - 1]` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Output State: **`j` is `len(q) - 1`; `q` must have at least one element; `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[len(q) - 1]]`; `to` is the leftmost index in `r` where `q[len(q) - 1]` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order.**
