Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[1]`; `p` is a list; `to` is the index where `l[1]` should be inserted in `p` to maintain its sorted order; `q` and `r` maintain their original lengths and content; `i` remains uninitialized; `j` is 1; `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted into the sublist `p[to:]` to maintain its sorted order; `z` is increased by `p1 - to - 1`.**
