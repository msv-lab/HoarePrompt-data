Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `len(q)` is greater than 0, `l` is either `[p[i+1], q[0]]` or `[q[0], p[i+1]]` sorted, `to` is the index of the first occurrence of `l[1]` in `r`, `isTrue` is the index in the sublist `r[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted, `z` is updated as follows: if `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is increased by `r1 - to - 1`; otherwise, `z` is increased by `r1 - to`, `r` retains its original value, `q` retains its original value, `r1` retains its original value, `s` retains its original value, `N` retains its original value, `d` retains its original value.***
