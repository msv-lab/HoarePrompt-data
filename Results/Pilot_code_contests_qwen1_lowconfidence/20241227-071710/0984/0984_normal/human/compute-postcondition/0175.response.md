`z` is updated by adding `p1 - to` to its current value. Since `p1` and `to` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `z`, but we know that `z` is increased by `p1 - to`.

Output State: **`l` is either `[q[i], r[j + 1]]` or `[r[j + 1], q[i]]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` is inserted in `p` to maintain order, `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `j` is `j + 1`, `z` is updated by adding `p1 - to` to its current value.**
