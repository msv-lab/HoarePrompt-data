`z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`. The values of the other variables are unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`, `l` is sorted in ascending order from `[q[i], r[j + 1]]`.**
