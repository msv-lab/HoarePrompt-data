The initial state is unknown, so the values of `z` and `q1` and `to` are also unknown. The code `z += q1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding the result of `q1 - to` to its current value.

Since the initial values are unknown, the only thing we can definitively say is that `z` has been updated to `z + (q1 - to)`. The other variables remain in their unknown states.

Output State: **`z` is `z + (q1 - to)`, `q1` is unknown, `to` is unknown**
