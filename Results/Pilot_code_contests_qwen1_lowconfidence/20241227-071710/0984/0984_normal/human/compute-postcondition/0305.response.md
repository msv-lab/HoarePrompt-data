Output State: **`i` is `len(p)`, `j` is `len(r)`, `l` is an empty list, `to` is the last value calculated during the loop for `l[1]`, `isTrue` is the last value calculated during the loop for `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `q[to:]`, `z` is the cumulative sum of all updates made based on the conditions in the loop, and `r` must have at least 0 elements (i.e., `len(r) >= 0`).**
