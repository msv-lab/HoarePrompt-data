Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `to` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p, qj)`.
   - `p` is a list of indices where 'R' appears in `s`.
   - `q` is a non-empty list.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`.
   - `l` is a sorted list containing the `i`-th element of `p` and the `j`-th element of `q`.
   - `isTrue` is an index.
   - `z` is a variable that is incremented.

2. **Try Block:**
   - The condition checks whether `r[to:][isTrue]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`.
   - If the condition is false, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.

3. **Except Block:**
   - The `except` block handles any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the `try` block.
   - If an exception occurs, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.

### Points Where Exceptions Could Occur:
- **Index Error:** If `to` is out of bounds for the list `r`, or `isTrue` is out of bounds for the slice `r[to:]`.
- **TypeError:** If `r[to:]` is not a list, or `2 * l[1] - l[0]` is not a valid index operation.

### Summary of What the Try Except Statement Accomplishes:
- The `try` block checks if `r[to:][isTrue]` matches `2 * l[1] - l[0]`. If it matches, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`; otherwise, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.
- The `except` block ensures that even if an exception occurs, `z` is still incremented by `r1 - to`.

### Output State After Execution:
- `to`, `p`, `q`, `d`, `l`, and `isTrue` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- `z` is incremented by either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to`, depending on whether the condition in the `try` block is met or not.
- In case of any exception, `z` is guaranteed to be incremented by `r1 - to`.

### Final Output:
Output State: **`to`, `p`, `q`, `d`, `l`, and `isTrue` remain unchanged from their initial states. `z` is incremented by either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to`, depending on whether the condition in the `try` block is met or not. In case of any exception, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.**
