The initial state is unknown, but we know that `z` and `q1` and `to` are variables involved in the operation `z += q1 - to`. Since the initial values of these variables are not specified, we can only state that `z` is incremented by the value of `q1 - to`.

Output State: **`z` is incremented by `q1 - to`, the initial values of `q1` and `to` are unknown**
