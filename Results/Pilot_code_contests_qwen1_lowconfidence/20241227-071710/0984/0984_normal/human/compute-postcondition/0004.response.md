The code `d[i] = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is not defined before this line, it will be treated as a new key. The initial state specifies that `d` is an empty dictionary, so the only change is the addition of this new key-value pair.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', `s` must not be an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where `d[i]` is an empty list**
