`z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`. The values of `l`, `to`, `isTrue`, and `p` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`l` contains the sorted list of `[q[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain order, `isTrue` is the index at which the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted into `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, the value at `p[to + isTrue]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, and `z` is increased by `p1 - to - 1`.**
