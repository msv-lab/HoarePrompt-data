Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\).
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`.
- The for loop iterates over the length of the string `s`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `N` is within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\).
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `d` is a dictionary mapping characters in `s` to lists of their indices.

### For Loop Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(len(s)):` means that the loop will iterate over each index from `0` to `len(s) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the loop variable `i` was set to some value `k` (where `0 <= k < len(s)`).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`.
2. **Current State**: After the previous iteration, `i` was `k`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to `k + 1`.
3. **Dictionary `d`**: The dictionary `d` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

### Adjusted States:
- `N` remains within the same range \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\).
- `s` remains the same non-empty string.
- `d` remains the same dictionary mapping characters in `s` to their indices.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `k + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string; `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`; `i` is `k + 1`**.

To be more specific, if we denote the current index `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string; `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`; `i` is `k + 1`**.

If we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string; `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`; `i` is the next index after the last processed index**.
