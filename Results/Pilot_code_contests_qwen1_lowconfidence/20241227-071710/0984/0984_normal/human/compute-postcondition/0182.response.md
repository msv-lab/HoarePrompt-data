The code `l = sorted([q[i], r[j]])` sorts the list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]` and assigns the sorted list to `l`. However, the values of `q` and `r` are not specified in the initial state, and neither are the values of `i` and `j`. Therefore, we can only say that `l` is a sorted list containing the elements `q[i]` and `r[j]`.

Output State: **`j` must be a value within the range `0 <= j < len(r)`, `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`**
