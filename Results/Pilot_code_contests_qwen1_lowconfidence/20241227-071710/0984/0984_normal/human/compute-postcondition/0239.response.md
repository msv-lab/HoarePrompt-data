Postcondition: ***`l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is updated to the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the sorted list `q` without disturbing its order, `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where `val` (which is `2 * l[1] - l[0]`) would be inserted, `z` is updated as follows: if `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, `z` is updated by adding `q1 - to - 1` to its current value; otherwise, `z` is updated by adding `q1 - to` to its original value, `j` is `k + 1`***
