`z` is incremented by the value of `p1 - to`. However, since the initial values of `z`, `p1`, and `to` are unknown, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `z` after the operation. But we know that `z` is now `z + (p1 - to)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`z` is `z + (p1 - to)`, `p1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
