The given code snippet `z += q1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding the result of `q1 - to` to its current value. However, since the initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, we can only express the updated value of `z` in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`z` is updated to its current value plus `q1 - to`.**

If we had specific values for `q1` and `to`, we could provide a more specific value for `z`. For now, the best we can do is to express the updated value of `z` in terms of the original variables.
