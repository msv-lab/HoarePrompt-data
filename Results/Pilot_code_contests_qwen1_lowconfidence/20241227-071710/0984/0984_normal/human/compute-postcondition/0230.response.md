Postcondition: ***`l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`; `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the sorted list `q` without disturbing its order; `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted. If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is increased by `q1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is updated by the value of `q1 - to`.***
