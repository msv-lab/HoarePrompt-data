The code snippet `z += r1 - to` modifies the value of `z`. However, since the initial state is unknown, we can only say that `z` is updated by adding the value of `r1 - to` to its current value. The variables `r1` and `to` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`z` is updated by adding `r1 - to` to its current value, `r1` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
