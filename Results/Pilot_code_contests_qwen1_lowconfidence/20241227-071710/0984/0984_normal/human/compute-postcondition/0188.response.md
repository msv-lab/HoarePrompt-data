The code `z += p1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding `p1 - to` to its current value. Since the initial value of `z` is not specified, we can denote the updated value of `z` as `z' = z + (p1 - to)`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `j` must still be a value within the range `0 <= j < len(r)`
- `l` is still a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`
- `to` is still the index where `l[1]` (either `q[i]` or `r[j]`) is inserted into `p` to maintain the sorted order
- `isTrue` is still the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order
- `p[to:][isTrue]` is still not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`

Output State: **`j` must be a value within the range `0 <= j < len(r)`, `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` is inserted into `p` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, `z` is updated to `z + (p1 - to)`**
