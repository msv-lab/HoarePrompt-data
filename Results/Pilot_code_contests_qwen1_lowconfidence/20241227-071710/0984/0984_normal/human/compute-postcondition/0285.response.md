Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step to determine the possible points where exceptions can occur and the overall output state of the program after executing the `try` statement and any associated `except` blocks.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `i_current + 2`
   - `j` is 0
   - `l` is `[p[i], r[0]]`
   - `to` is the index where `r[0]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order
   - `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[0] - p[i])`
   - `z` is the sum of all updates made based on the conditions in the loop
   - `r` must have at least 1 element

2. **Code Execution in Try Block:**
   ```python
   try:
       if q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]:
           z += q1 - to - 1
       else:
           z += q1 - to
   ```

3. **Possible Exceptions:**
   - An exception could occur if `q[to:]` is empty, making `q[to:][isTrue]` invalid.
   - An exception could also occur if `isTrue` is out of bounds for the slice `q[to:]`.

4. **Handling Exceptions in Except Block:**
   ```python
   except:
       z += q1 - to
   ```
   This except block catches any exception and updates `z` to `z + (q1 - to)`.

### Summary of the Program's State After Executing the Try Statement and Except Blocks

- The `try` block checks if `q[to:][isTrue]` matches the condition `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
  - If true, `z` is updated by `z += (q1 - to - 1)`.
  - If false, `z` is updated by `z += (q1 - to)`.

- The `except` block handles any exception by updating `z` to `z + (q1 - to)`.

### Final Output State

Given the analysis, the output state after the complete execution of the `try` statement and any associated `except` blocks can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`i` is `i_current + 2`, `j` is 0, `l` is `[p[i], r[0]]`, `to` is the index where `r[0]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[0] - p[i])`, `z` is updated based on the condition in the `try` block or by adding `q1 - to` in the `except` block, and `r` must have at least 1 element.**

This means `z` will be updated according to the conditions in the `try` block, or it will fall back to adding `q1 - to` in case of any exception.
