The code `z += p1 - to` updates the value of `z` by adding the result of `p1 - to` to its current value. However, the initial values of `z`, `p1`, and `to` are unknown. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `z` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`z` is updated to its current value plus `p1 - to`, `p1` is unchanged, `to` is unchanged**
