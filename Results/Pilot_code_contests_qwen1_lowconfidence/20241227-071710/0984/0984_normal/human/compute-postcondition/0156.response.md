Postcondition: **`l` contains the sorted list of `[q[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain order, `isTrue` is the index at which the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted into `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, and `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`**
