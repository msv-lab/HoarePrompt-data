Postcondition: `i` is `i_current + 2`, `j` is 0, `l` is `[p[i], r[0]]`, `to` is the index where `r[0]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[0] - p[i])`, `z` is the sum of all updates made based on the conditions in the loop, `r` must have at least 1 element, and `q[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`
