Postcondition: ***`j` is within the range `0 <= j < len(r)`, `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` is inserted into `p` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, and `z` is updated as follows: if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is increased by `p1 - to - 1`; otherwise, `z` is updated to `z + (p1 - to)`.***
