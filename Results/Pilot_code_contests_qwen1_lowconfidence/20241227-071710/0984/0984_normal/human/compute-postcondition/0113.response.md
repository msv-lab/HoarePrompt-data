Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `l` is `[a, b]`, `to` is the index in `r` where `b` fits according to the sorted order, `isTrue` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * b - a)`, `z` is either `z + r1 - to - 1` if `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true, or `z + r1 - to` if the condition is false.***
