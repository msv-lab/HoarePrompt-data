`z` is incremented by `p1 - to`. The values of `p1`, `to`, `l`, `isTrue`, and the conditions regarding `p[to:]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` contains the sorted list of `[q[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain order, `isTrue` is the index at which the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted into `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, and `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`; `z` is increased by `p1 - to`.

Output State: **`l` contains the sorted list of `[q[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain order, `isTrue` is the index at which the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted into `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, and `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`; `z` is increased by `p1 - to`**
