Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the sorted list `q` without disturbing its order, `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted, `z` is updated by the sum of all `q1 - to - 1` when the condition `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true and by `q1 - to` otherwise for all iterations of the loop, `j` is `len(r)` and the loop does not execute if `len(r) == 0`.**
