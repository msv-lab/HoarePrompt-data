Postcondition: ***`l` is either `[q[i], r[j + 1]]` or `[r[j + 1], q[i]]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` is inserted in `p` to maintain order, `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `j` is `j + 1`. Depending on the condition of the if statement, `z` is updated either by adding `p1 - to - 1` to its current value (if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`) or by adding `p1 - to` to its current value (otherwise).***
