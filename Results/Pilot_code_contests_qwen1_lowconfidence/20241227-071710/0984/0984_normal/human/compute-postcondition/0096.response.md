The code snippet `z += r1 - to` means that `z` is updated by adding the result of `r1 - to` to its current value. However, since the initial state of the variables is unknown, the exact values cannot be determined. The only change is that `z` is now equal to its original value plus `r1 - to`.

Output State: **the state is unknown, but `z` is updated to its original value plus `r1 - to`.**
