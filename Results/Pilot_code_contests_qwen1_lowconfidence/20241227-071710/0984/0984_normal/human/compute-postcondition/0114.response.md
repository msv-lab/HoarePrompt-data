The code snippet `z += r1 - to` modifies the value of `z` by adding the result of `r1 - to` to its current value. Since the initial state of the variables is unknown, the only change we can make is to the variable `z`. The states of the other variables (`r1` and `to`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`z` is its original value plus `r1 - to`, `r1` is an unknown value, `to` is an unknown value**
