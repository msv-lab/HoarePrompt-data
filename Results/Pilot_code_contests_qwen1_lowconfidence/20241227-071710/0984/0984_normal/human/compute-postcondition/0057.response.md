`l` is assigned the value of a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `q[j]`. Since `j` is `len(q) - 1`, `q[j]` refers to the last element of the list `q`. The value of `p[i]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `len(q) - 1`; `q` must have at least one element; `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[len(q) - 1]]`.

Output State: **`j` is `len(q) - 1`; `q` must have at least one element; `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[len(q) - 1]]`.**
