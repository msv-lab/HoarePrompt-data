Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_current + 2`, `j` is 1, `l` is `[i_current + 2, r1]`, `to` is the index where `r1` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the value of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r1 - (i_current + 2))`, and `z` is either incremented by `q1 - to - 1` or `z + (q1 - to)`, depending on whether `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`. `r` must have at least 1 element.***
