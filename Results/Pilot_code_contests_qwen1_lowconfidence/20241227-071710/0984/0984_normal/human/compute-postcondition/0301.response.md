Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_current + 2`, `j` is `2`, `l` is `[p[i_current + 2], r[2]]`, `to` is the index where `r[2]` should be inserted in `q` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * r[2] - p[i_current + 2])`, `z` is updated by adding `(q1 - to - 1)` if `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true, otherwise it is updated by adding `(q1 - to)`, and `r` must have at least 1 element.***
