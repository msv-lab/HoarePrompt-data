Postcondition: **`l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the sorted list `q` without disturbing its order, `isTrue` is the index at which `2 * r[j] - p[i]` would be inserted into `q[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, but `q[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`. `l` and `q` remain sorted lists.**
