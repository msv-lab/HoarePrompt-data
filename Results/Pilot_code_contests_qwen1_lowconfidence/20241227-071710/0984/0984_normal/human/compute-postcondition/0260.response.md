Output State: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `j` is greater than 1, `l` is `[p[i_current + 1], r[j + 1]]`, `to` is the index found by inserting `l[1]` into `q` using `bisect.bisect_left`, `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where the condition `2 * l[1] - l[0]` is checked, `z` is updated by adding `q1 - to` to its current value, and `isTrue` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`.**
