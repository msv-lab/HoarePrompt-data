Postcondition: ***`to` is updated to the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in `r` to maintain the sorted order, `p`, `q`, `d`, `l` are sorted([`p[i]`, `q[j]`]), `z` is incremented by either `2 * (r1 - to - 1)` or `r1 - to`, `j` is 3, `isTrue` is the index at which `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order.***
