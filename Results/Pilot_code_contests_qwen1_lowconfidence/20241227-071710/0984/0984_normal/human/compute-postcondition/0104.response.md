Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `l` is [a, b], `to` is the index in `r` where `b` would fit according to the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2b - a` would fit according to the sorted order, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1` if `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true, otherwise `z` is increased by `r1 - to`.***
