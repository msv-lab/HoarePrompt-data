Postcondition: ***`l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`; `p` includes `l[1]` at index `to` to maintain its sorted order; `to` is the index where `l[1]` was inserted; `q` and `r` maintain their original lengths and content; `i` remains uninitialized; `j` is 2; `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted into the sublist `p[to:]` to maintain its sorted order; `z` remains unchanged if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, otherwise `z` is increased by `p1 - to`.***
