The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])` impacts the program by assigning the value of the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the sorted list `q` without disturbing its order to the variable `to`. The values of `l` and `q` remain unchanged. The previous value of `l[1]` is still valid, and the new value of `to` is determined by the position where `l[1]` would fit in `q`.

Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `p[i]` is a value from variable `p` at index `i`, `r[j]` is a value from variable `r` at index `j`; `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the sorted list `q` without disturbing its order.**
