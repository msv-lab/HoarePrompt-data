`i` is 0, so `d[s[i]]` is equivalent to `d[s[0]]`. The code appends `i` (which is 0) to the list associated with `s[0]` in the dictionary `d`. The initial state is: `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\), `s` is a non-empty string, `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`, `i` is 0.

After the code executes, the value of `i` remains unchanged (it is still 0), but the value of `d` changes because `i` (0) is appended to the list corresponding to `s[0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\), `s` is a non-empty string, `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s` with `s[0]`'s list including 0, `i` is 0**
