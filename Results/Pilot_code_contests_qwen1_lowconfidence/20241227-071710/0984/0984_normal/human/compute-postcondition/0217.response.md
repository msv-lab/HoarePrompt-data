Postcondition: **`l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the sorted list `q` without disturbing its order, `isTrue` is the index at which `2 * r[j] - p[i]` should be inserted into `q[to:]` to maintain the sorted order. `q[to:][isTrue]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.**
