Postcondition: **`j` is `len(q) - 1`, `q` must have at least one element, `l` is a list containing the sorted elements `[p[i], q[len(q) - 1]]`, `to` is the leftmost index in `r` where `q[len(q) - 1]` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, if `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true, `z` is its original value plus `r1 - to - 1`; otherwise, `z` is increased by `r1 - to`.**
