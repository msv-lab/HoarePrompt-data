`z` is incremented by the value of `p1 - to - 1`. The values of `p1`, `to`, and `isTrue` are not explicitly given, but their values are used in the calculation. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1; `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[j + 1])`; `isTrue` is calculated as `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`; `z` is increased by `p1 - to - 1`**
