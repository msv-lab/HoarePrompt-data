The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])` impacts the program by assigning the value of the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the list `p` to maintain order to the variable `to`. This does not change the values of `l`, `isTrue`, `z`, or `j`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 according to the initial state description.

Output State: **`l` is either `[q[i], r[j + 1]]` or `[r[j + 1], q[i]]`, depending on the values of `q[i]` and `r[j + 1]`; `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain order; `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order; `z` is updated; `j` is `j + 1`; `to` is the index where `l[1]` is inserted in `p` to maintain order.**
