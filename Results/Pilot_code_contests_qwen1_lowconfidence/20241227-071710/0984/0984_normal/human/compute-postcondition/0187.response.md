Postcondition: **`j` must be a value within the range `0 <= j < len(r)`, `l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` (either `q[i]` or `r[j]`) is inserted into `p` to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order, `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`**
