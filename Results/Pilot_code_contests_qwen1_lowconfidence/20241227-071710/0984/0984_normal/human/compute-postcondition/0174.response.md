`z` is updated by adding `p1 - to - 1` to its current value. The values of `l`, `to`, `isTrue`, and `j` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`l` is either `[q[i], r[j + 1]]` or `[r[j + 1], q[i]]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` is inserted in `p` to maintain order, `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `j` is `j + 1`, `z` is updated to its previous value plus `p1 - to - 1`.**
