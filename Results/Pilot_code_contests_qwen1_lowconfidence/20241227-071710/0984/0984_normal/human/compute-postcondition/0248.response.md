Postcondition: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `j` is greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i_current + 1]` and `r[j]`, `to` is the index where `l[1]` would be inserted into the sorted list `q` using `bisect.bisect_left`, `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted, `z` is updated based on the condition `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` and the current value of `z` is true, `to` is the index found by inserting `l[1]` into `q` using `bisect.bisect_left`**
