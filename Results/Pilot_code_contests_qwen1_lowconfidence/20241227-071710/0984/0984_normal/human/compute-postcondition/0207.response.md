Postcondition: ***`j` is `j + 1`, `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `z` is incremented by either `p1 - to - 1` or `p1 - to`, depending on whether `p[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, and `l` is sorted in ascending order from `[q[i], r[j + 1]]`.***
