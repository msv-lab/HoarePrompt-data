Postcondition: **`l` is a sorted list containing `q[i]` and `r[0]`; `p` is a list; `to` is the index where `l[1]` should be inserted in `p` to maintain its sorted order; `q` and `r` maintain their original lengths and content; `i` remains uninitialized; `j` is 0; `isTrue` is the index where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted into the sublist `p[to:]` to maintain its sorted order; `output` remains unspecified. Moreover, `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.**
