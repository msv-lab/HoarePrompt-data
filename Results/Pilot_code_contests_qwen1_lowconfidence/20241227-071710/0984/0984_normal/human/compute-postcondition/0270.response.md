Postcondition: **`j` is `len_r + 1`, `r` has at least `len_r + 1` elements, `l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index of the first occurrence in `q` where an element is not less than `[p[i], r[j]]`, `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where `2 * r[j] - p[i]` would be inserted to maintain order, and `z` is updated according to whether `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`. If the condition is true, `z` is increased by `q1 - to - 1`. If the condition is false, `z` is updated by adding `q1 - to` to its current value.**
