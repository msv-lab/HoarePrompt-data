Postcondition: ***`j` is incremented by 1; `to` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(p, r[j + 1])`; `isTrue` is calculated as `bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`; if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is increased by `p1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is increased by `p1 - to`.***
