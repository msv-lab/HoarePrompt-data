The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])` impacts the program by assigning the value of the index in list `r` where the element `l[1]` (which is `b`) would fit according to the sorted order to the variable `to`. 

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 2
- `l` is `[a, b]`
- `to` is the index in `r` where `b` would fit according to the sorted order
- `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2b - a` would fit according to the sorted order

After executing the code, `to` will be updated to the index in `r` where `b` fits.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `l` is [a, b], `to` is the index in `r` where `b` fits according to the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `r[to:]` where `2b - a` would fit according to the sorted order**
