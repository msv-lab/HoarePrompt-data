`to` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(p, l[1])`. This function returns the index in the sorted list `p` where the value of `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain order. The state of `l` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` contains the sorted list of `[q[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain order.**
