Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Initial States**: 
   - `i` is `i_current + 1`
   - `j` is greater than 0
   - `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i_current + 1]` and `r[j]`
   - `to` is the index found by inserting `l[1]` into `q` using `bisect.bisect_left`
   - `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where the condition `2 * l[1] - l[0]` is checked
   - `z` is updated by adding either `(q1 - to - 1)` or `(q1 - to)` depending on the condition
   - An exception does not prevent the update

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `range(len(r))`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `l` is constructed from `p[i_current + 1]` and `r[j]`, and `i` remains unchanged, `l` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j`.
   - `to` and `isTrue` will be recalculated based on the new `l` and the current value of `j`.
   - `z` will be updated again based on the new `to` and `isTrue`.

4. **Final States After One More Iteration**:
   - `i` remains `i_current + 1` (unchanged)
   - `j` becomes `j + 1` (since it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute)
   - `l` is now a sorted list containing `p[i_current + 1]` and `r[j + 1]`
   - `to` is the index found by inserting `l[1]` into `q` using `bisect.bisect_left`
   - `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where the condition `2 * l[1] - l[0]` is checked
   - `z` is updated by adding either `(q1 - to - 1)` or `(q1 - to)` depending on the condition

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `j` is greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list containing `p[i_current + 1]` and `r[j + 1]`, `to` is the index found by inserting `l[1]` into `q` using `bisect.bisect_left`, `isTrue` is the index in `q[to:]` where the condition `2 * l[1] - l[0]` is checked, `z` is updated by adding either `(q1 - to - 1)` or `(q1 - to)` depending on the condition, and an exception does not prevent the update.**
