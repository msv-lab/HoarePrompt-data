Postcondition: ***`to` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p, qj)`, `p` is a list of indices where 'R' appears in `s`, `q` is a non-empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`, `l` is a sorted list containing the `i`-th element of `p` and the `j`-th element of `q`, `isTrue` is an index, and `z` is incremented. If `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.***
