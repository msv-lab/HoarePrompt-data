Postcondition: ***`to` is updated to the index where `l[1]` would be inserted in `r` to maintain the sorted order; `p`, `q`, `d`, `l` are sorted arrays such that `l = [p[i], q[4]]`; `z` is incremented by either `r1 - to - 1` or `r1 - to` depending on the condition; `j` is 4; `isTrue` is the index at which `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order; in case of an exception, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`; `l` is `[p[i], q[4]]`; `isTrue` is updated to the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `r[to:]` to maintain the sorted order.***
