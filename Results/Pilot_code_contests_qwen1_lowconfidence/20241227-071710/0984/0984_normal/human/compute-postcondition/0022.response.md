The code `r1 = len(r)` calculates the length of the list `r` and assigns it to the variable `r1`. This does not affect the other variables, so the output state includes the updated value of `r1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\); `s` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B'; `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`; `p` is the list of indices where 'R' appears in `s`; `q` is the list of indices where 'G' appears in `s`; `r` is the list of indices where 'B' appears in `s`; `p1` is the length of the list `p`; `q1` is the length of the list `q`; `r1` is the length of the list `r`.**
