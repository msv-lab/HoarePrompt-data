Postcondition: ***`j` is `len(q) - 1`, `l` is `[p[i], q[j]]`, `to` is the index of the first element in `r` that is not less than `q[j]`, `isTrue` is the position where `2 * q[j] - p[i]` would be inserted into `r[to:]` to maintain sorted order, `z` is updated to either `z + (r1 - to - 1)` or `z + (r1 - to)` depending on whether `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]` is true or false.***
