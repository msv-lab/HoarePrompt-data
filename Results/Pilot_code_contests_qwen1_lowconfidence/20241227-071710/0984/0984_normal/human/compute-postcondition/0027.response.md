The code `to = bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])` impacts the variable `to`. The value of `r` is `p`, which is a list of indices where 'R' appears in `s`. The value of `l` is a sorted list containing the `i`-th element of `p` and the `j`-th element of `q`. The function `bisect.bisect_left` returns the index where the value `l[1]` should be inserted to keep the list `r` (which is `p`) sorted.

Since the exact values of `p` and `q` are not specified, let's denote the elements of `p` and `q` generically. Suppose `p = [p1, p2, ..., pn]` and `q = [q1, q2, ..., qm]`, where `l = [pi, qj]`.

The value of `l[1]` is `qj`. The `bisect.bisect_left` function will find the position in `p` (which is `r`) where `qj` would fit to maintain the sorted order of `p`.

The output state after the code is executed will be:
- `to` is assigned the value returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p, qj)`, where `p` is the list of indices where 'R' appears in `s`, and `qj` is the `j`-th element of `q`.
- All other variables (`p`, `q`, `d`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`to` is the index returned by `bisect.bisect_left(p, qj)`, `p` is a list of indices where 'R' appears in `s`, `q` is a non-empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of all indices where that character appears in `s`, `l` is a sorted list containing the `i`-th element of `p` and the `j`-th element of `q`.**
