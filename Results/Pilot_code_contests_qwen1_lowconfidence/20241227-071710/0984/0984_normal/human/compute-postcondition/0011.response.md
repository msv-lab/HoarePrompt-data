The code `d[s[i]].append(i)` iterates over the characters in the string `s` and appends the index `i` to the list corresponding to the character `s[i]` in the dictionary `d`.

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to an empty list.
2. The code `d[s[i]].append(i)` will iterate through each character `s[i]` in the string `s` and append the index `i` to the list in `d` that corresponds to the character `s[i]`.

Since the initial state of `d` is that each character in `s` is mapped to an empty list, after running the code, each character in `s` will now have a list containing all the indices where that character appears in `s`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\)
- `s` is a non-empty string (i.e., its length is at least 1)
- `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 4000\); `s` is a non-empty string; `d` is a dictionary where each character in `s` is mapped to a list of indices where that character appears in `s`**
