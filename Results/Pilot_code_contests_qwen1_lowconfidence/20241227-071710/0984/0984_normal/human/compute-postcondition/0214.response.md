The given code `l = sorted([p[i], r[j]])` sorts the list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]` and assigns the sorted list to `l`. However, without knowing the specific values of `p[i]` and `r[j]`, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `l`. Therefore, the best we can say is that `l` is a sorted list containing the values of `p[i]` and `r[j]`.

Output State: **`l` is a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`, `p[i]` is a value from variable `p` at index `i`, `r[j]` is a value from variable `r` at index `j`**
