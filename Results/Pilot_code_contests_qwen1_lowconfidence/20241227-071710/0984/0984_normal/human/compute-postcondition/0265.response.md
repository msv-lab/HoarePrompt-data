`l` is assigned the value of a sorted list containing `p[i]` and `r[j]`. The value of `j` is `len_r + 1`, and since `r` must have at least `len_r + 1` elements, `r[j]` is a valid element in the list `r`. The values of `p[i]` and `r[j]` are used to create the sorted list, but their specific values are not provided. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is `len_r + 1`, `r` must have at least `len_r + 1` elements, `l` is a sorted list containing `[p[i], r[j]]`**
