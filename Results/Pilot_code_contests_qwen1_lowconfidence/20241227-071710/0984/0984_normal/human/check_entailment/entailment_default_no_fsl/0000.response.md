Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the condition \(2 \times \min(j, k) - \max(i, j) == k - i\) is not equivalent to the required condition \(j - i \neq k - j\). 

To verify this, consider the following example:

- For the string "RRGB", the valid triplet (i, j, k) is (0, 3, 2) because \(S_0 = 'R'\), \(S_3 = 'G'\), and \(S_2 = 'B'\), and the indices satisfy \(0 < 2 < 3\) and \(j - i \neq k - j\) (i.e., \(3 - 0 \neq 2 - 3\)).

However, the code does not check the condition \(j - i \neq k - j\) directly. Instead, it checks a different condition involving minimum and maximum values, which may fail to capture the correct logic. This leads to incorrect counting of valid triplets.

For instance, in the provided code, the following lines are used to check the condition:
```python
to = bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])
isTrue = bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])
```

These lines do not correctly enforce the condition \(j - i \neq k - j\). The condition \(2 \times \min(j, k) - \max(i, j) == k - i\) is a more complex way to enforce the relative spacing between indices, but it is not the same as \(j - i \neq k - j\).

Therefore, the code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description and produces incorrect results for some inputs. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
