Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid triples \((i, j, k)\) such that:
1. \(S_i \neq S_j\), \(S_i \neq S_k\), and \(S_j \neq S_k\).
2. \(j - i \neq k - j\).

#### Key Points:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program first reads the length \(N\) and the string \(S\).
   - It initializes a dictionary `d` to store the indices of each character ('R', 'G', 'B') in the string \(S\).

2. **Populating Indices**:
   - For each character in the string \(S\), it appends the index to the corresponding list in the dictionary `d`.

3. **Counting Valid Triples**:
   - The program then uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of indices from the lists `p`, `q`, and `r` which represent the indices of 'R', 'G', and 'B' respectively.
   - For each combination of indices, it checks if the conditions \(S_i \neq S_j\), \(S_i \neq S_k\), and \(S_j \neq S_k\) are satisfied.
   - It also checks if \(j - i \neq k - j\) by ensuring that \(2 * l[1] - l[0]\) (where \(l = [p[i], q[j]]\) or similar) is not equal to any index in the remaining part of the list.

4. **Handling Ties**:
   - The program handles ties and exceptions by checking if the computed value matches the expected value and adjusting the count accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the count of valid triples.

### Why the Program Follows the Problem Description:

- The program correctly processes the input string and extracts the required information.
- It iterates over all possible triplets and applies the necessary conditions to filter out invalid ones.
- The logic ensures that no two indices form a triplet where \(j - i = k - j\).
- The counting mechanism is correct as it sums up all valid triplets.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all cases as specified, it is deemed **correct**.
