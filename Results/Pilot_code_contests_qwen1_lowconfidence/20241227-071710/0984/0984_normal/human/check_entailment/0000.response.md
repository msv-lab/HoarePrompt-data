Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem but fails to handle certain edge cases. Specifically, the logic for checking the condition \(j - i \neq k - j\) is flawed. The program does not correctly ensure this condition is met for all valid triplets. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Condition \(j - i \neq k - j\)**:
   - The program checks for the equality of differences but does not exclude the cases where \(j - i = k - j\). This means it includes invalid triplets where the difference between indices is the same, which violates the problem constraints.

2. **Potential Case Where Program Fails**:
   - Consider the string `RRGB`. The valid triplet is `(0, 2, 3)` because:
     - \(S_0 = R\), \(S_2 = G\), \(S_3 = B\).
     - \(S_0 \neq S_2\), \(S_0 \neq S_3\), and \(S_2 \neq S_3\).
     - However, \(2 - 0 = 3 - 2 = 2\), which violates the condition \(j - i \neq k - j\).

To illustrate, let's manually check the valid triplet `(0, 2, 3)`:
- For \(i = 0\), \(j = 2\), and \(k = 3\):
  - \(S_0 = R\), \(S_2 = G\), \(S_3 = B\).
  - \(S_0 \neq S_2\), \(S_0 \neq S_3\), and \(S_2 \neq S_3\).
  - But \(2 - 0 = 3 - 2\), so this triplet should not be counted.

Since the program includes this invalid triplet, it fails to meet the problem description accurately.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
