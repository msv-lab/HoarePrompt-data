Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input `N` and string `S` correctly, ensuring they meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ N ≤ 4000 and S consists of 'R', 'G', and 'B').

2. **Dictionary Construction**: The program constructs a dictionary `d` where each key is a character ('R', 'G', or 'B') and the value is a list of indices where that character appears in the string `S`. This step is necessary to efficiently find and compare the positions of different characters.

3. **Triple Count Calculation**:
   - The program uses three nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of indices from the lists `p`, `q`, and `r`, where `p`, `q`, and `r` store the indices of 'R', 'G', and 'B' characters, respectively.
   - For each combination, it checks if the condition `j - i ≠ k - j` is satisfied, which ensures that the indices form a non-degenerate triplet.
   - The condition `S_i ≠ S_j, S_i ≠ S_k, and S_j ≠ S_k` is inherently satisfied because `p`, `q`, and `r` only contain indices of distinct characters.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when one or more of the lists `p`, `q`, or `r` are empty by using conditional checks within the nested loops, ensuring that invalid comparisons do not occur.

5. **Output**: The program prints the count of valid triplets, which is the final result.

Since the program follows the problem description and handles all necessary conditions and constraints correctly, it is correct.
