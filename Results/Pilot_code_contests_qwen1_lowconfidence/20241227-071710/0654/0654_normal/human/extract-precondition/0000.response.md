Precondition: **sync is a boolean value indicating whether the standard Python streams should be allowed to buffer their I/O.**

However, the given function `func_1` does not seem to directly contribute to solving the described problem about painting bricks. Instead, it manipulates how input and output are handled in the program. This function is more related to I/O management rather than the logic required to solve the brick-painting problem. Based on the problem description and the provided function, there is no direct relationship between the variables in `func_1` and the variables in the brick-painting problem. Therefore, the precondition for `func_1` is as stated above, but it does not apply to the brick-painting scenario.
