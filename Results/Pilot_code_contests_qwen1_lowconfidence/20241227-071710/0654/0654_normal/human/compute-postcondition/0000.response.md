The provided code snippet does not actually assign a value to the `sync` variable or perform any operation that changes its value. It is simply a docstring defining a function that would accept a boolean argument to set the synchronization setting for standard Python streams. Since no assignment or operation is performed on `sync`, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sync` is a boolean value indicating whether the standard Python streams should be allowed to buffer their I/O.**
