The function `func` accepts two parameters: `K` and `S`, where `K` is an integer in the range [2, 2500] and `S` is an integer in the range [0, 3K]. The function iterates through all possible values of `x` and `y` in the range [0, K] and counts the number of valid `(x, y)` pairs that satisfy the condition `0 <= s - x - y <= k`. After executing the loops, the function prints the count of valid pairs. There are no return statements in the provided code, so the function does not return anything.
