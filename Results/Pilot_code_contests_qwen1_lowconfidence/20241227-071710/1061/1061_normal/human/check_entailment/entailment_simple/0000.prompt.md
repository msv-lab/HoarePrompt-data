You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two integers K and S.
Three variable X, Y and Z takes integer values satisfying 0≤X,Y,Z≤K.
How many different assignments of values to X, Y and Z are there such that X + Y + Z = S?

Constraints

* 2≤K≤2500
* 0≤S≤3K
* K and S are integers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


K S


Output

Print the number of the triples of X, Y and Z that satisfy the condition.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: K is an integer such that 2 ≤ K ≤ 2500, and S is an integer such that 0 ≤ S ≤ 3K.
def func():
    k, s = map(int, raw_input().split())
    patterns = []
    ct = 0
    for x in range(k + 1):
        nokori = s - x
        
        for y in range(k + 1):
            if 0 <= nokori - y <= k:
                ct += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ct` is the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs where both `x` and `y` are in the range `[0, k]` and satisfy the condition `0 <= s - x - y <= k`, `nokori` is the remaining value of `s - x` after the outer loop, `y` is the last value of `y` considered in the inner loop, and `x` is the last value of `x` considered in the outer loop.
    print(ct)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
