`ct` is incremented by 1. The values of `x`, `y`, and `nokori` remain unchanged. The precondition that `nokori - y` is within the range `[0, k]` is still valid.

Output State: **`ct` is the count of integers `y` in the range `[0, k]` for which `0 <= nokori - y <= k` is true plus 1, `x` is `k + 1`, `y` is `0`, and `nokori` is `s - (k + 1)`.**
