The variable `nokori` is assigned the value `s - x`. However, the initial values of `s` and `x` are not provided in the initial state. Since `K` is given and its value does not affect the calculation of `nokori`, the only variable that changes is `nokori`. Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is an integer such that \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\); `nokori` is `s - x`.

Output State: **`K` is an integer such that \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\); `nokori` is `s - x`**
