`ct` is incremented by 1, but the initial values of `s`, `x`, and `y` are not affected. The condition \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\) still holds true, and the value of `nokori` remains unchanged as it is only defined in terms of `s` and `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is an integer such that \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\), `s` and `x` are such that `nokori = s - x`, the current value of `nokori` satisfies \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\), and `ct` is incremented by 1.
