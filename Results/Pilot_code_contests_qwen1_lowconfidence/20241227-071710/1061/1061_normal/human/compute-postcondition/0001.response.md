The code initializes an empty list named `patterns`. The variables `K` and `S` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `patterns` list.

Output State: **`K` is an integer such that 2 ≤ K ≤ 2500, and `S` is an integer such that 0 ≤ S ≤ 3K; `patterns` is an empty list.**
