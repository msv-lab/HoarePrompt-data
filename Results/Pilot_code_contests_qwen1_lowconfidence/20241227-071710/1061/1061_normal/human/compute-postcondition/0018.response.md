Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop variable `y` ranges from `0` to `k` inclusive. The loop will execute as long as `y` is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `x` is set to `x_end + 1`.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to `x_end + 1`.
   - `nokori` is defined as `s - x`.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - The loop condition depends on the value of `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least `x_end + 1`.
   - The initial value of `x` is `x_end + 1`. Since `x` is already set to this value, no adjustment is needed for `x`.
   - The value of `nokori` is defined based on `s` and `x`. Since `x` is `x_end + 1`, `nokori` will be `s - (x_end + 1)`, but this doesn't affect the loop execution directly.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x_end + 1`, which is already given as a requirement.
   - There are no additional states that need to be adjusted beyond ensuring `k` meets the condition.

**State:**
**`x` is `x_end + 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x_end + 1`, `nokori` is `s - x`**

Since the initial values and conditions are already sufficient for the loop to execute, no further adjustments are necessary.
