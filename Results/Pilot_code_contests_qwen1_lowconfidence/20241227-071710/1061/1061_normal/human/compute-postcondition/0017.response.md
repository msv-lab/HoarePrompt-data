`nokori` is assigned the value of `s - x`. According to the initial state, `x` is `x_end + 1`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `x_end + 1`. The value of `s` is not specified, so it remains as `s`. The output state updates the value of `nokori` while keeping the preconditions intact.

Output State: **`x` is `x_end + 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x_end + 1`, `nokori` is `s - x`**
