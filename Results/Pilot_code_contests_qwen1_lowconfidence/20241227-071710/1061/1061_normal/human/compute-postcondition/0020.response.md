`ct` is incremented by 1. The value of `nokori - y` is within the range `[0, k]`, but the specific values of `nokori`, `y`, and `k` are not altered. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ct` is increased by 1, `nokori` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and the value of `(0 <= nokori - y <= k)` is true**
