`ct` is incremented by 1 because the condition `0 <= nokori - (y + 1) <= k` was true. The value of `y` is \(y + 1\), and the state of `nokori` and `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nokori` is an integer, `y` is \(y + 1\), `ct` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`nokori` is an integer, `y` is \(y + 1\), `ct` is increased by 1**
