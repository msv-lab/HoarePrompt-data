`k` and `s` are assigned the values obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `k` and `s` will take the integer values entered by the user, split by spaces. The initial conditions for `k` (2 ≤ K ≤ 2500) and `s` (0 ≤ S ≤ 3K) are preserved, but their specific values are now determined by user input.

Output State: **K is an integer such that 2 ≤ K ≤ 2500, and S is an integer such that 0 ≤ S ≤ 3K; k is the integer input value and s is the integer input value.**
