`ct` is incremented by 1, which means `ct += 1`. The value of `nokori` and `y` remains unchanged from their initial state. The condition \(0 \leq \text{nokori} - (y_{\text{prev}} + 2) \leq k\) still holds true because the only change is in `ct`.

Output State: **`nokori` is an integer, `y` is \(y_{\text{prev}} + 1\), and the condition \(0 \leq \text{nokori} - (y_{\text{prev}} + 2) \leq k\) still holds true; `ct` is increased by 1.**
