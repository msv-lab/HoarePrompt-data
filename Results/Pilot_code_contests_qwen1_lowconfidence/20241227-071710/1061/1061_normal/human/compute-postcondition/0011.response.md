Postcondition: ***`K` is an integer such that \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\), `s` and `x` are such that `nokori = s - x`, `ct` is incremented by 1, and `y` is incremented by 1, if the condition \(0 \leq nokori - y \leq k\) is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied, the values of `ct` and `y` remain unchanged.***
