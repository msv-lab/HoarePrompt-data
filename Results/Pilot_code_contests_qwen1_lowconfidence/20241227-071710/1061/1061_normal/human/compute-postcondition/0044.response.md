The function `func` accepts two parameters: `K` and `S`. `K` is an integer such that 2 ≤ K ≤ 2500, and `S` is an integer such that 0 ≤ S ≤ 3K. The function has two cases:
- Case_1: `K` is an integer within the range [2, 2500] and `S` is an integer within the range [0, 3K]. If `S` is within this valid range, the function returns `S`.
- Case_2: If `S` is not within the valid range [0, 3K], the function returns an error message indicating that `S` is out of bounds.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters `K` and `S`, where `K` is an integer in the range [2, 2500] and `S` is an integer in the range [0, 3K]. It returns `S` if `S` is within the valid range, and returns an error message if `S` is out of bounds.
