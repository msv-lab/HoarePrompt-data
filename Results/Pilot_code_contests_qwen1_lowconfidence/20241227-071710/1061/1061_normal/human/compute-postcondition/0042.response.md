Output State: **`ct` is the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs where both `x` and `y` are in the range `[0, k]` and satisfy the condition `0 <= s - x - y <= k`, `nokori` is the remaining value of `s - x` after the outer loop, `y` is the last value of `y` considered in the inner loop, and `x` is the last value of `x` considered in the outer loop.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `K` is an integer such that \(2 \leq K \leq 2500\).
   - `S` is an integer such that \(0 \leq S \leq 3K\).
   - `patterns` is an empty list.
   - `ct` is initialized to 0.

2. **Outer Loop (`for x in range(k + 1):`)**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each possible value of `x` from 0 to `k`.

3. **Inner Loop (`for y in range(k + 1):`)**:
   - For each value of `x`, the inner loop iterates over each possible value of `y` from 0 to `k`.
   - Inside the inner loop, the expression `nokori = s - x` is computed.
   - The condition `0 <= nokori - y <= k` checks if the value of `nokori - y` falls within the range `[0, k]`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, `ct` is incremented.

4. **Final Values**:
   - After all iterations of the loops, `ct` will hold the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs that satisfy the condition.
   - `nokori` will be the value of `s - x` when the outer loop finishes.
   - `y` will be the last value of `y` considered in the inner loop for the last iteration of `x`.
   - `x` will be the last value of `x` considered in the outer loop.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is described as above.
