Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Handling of Bracket Sequences**: The program uses cumulative sums (`left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `left_max`, `right_max`) to track the state of the brackets. However, it does not properly account for the nested nature of brackets and the requirement to use the minimum number of colors to color them.

2. **Cursor Position and Context List**: The `context` list is used to store the values of the operations, but the logic to determine the minimum number of colors is flawed. The program does not correctly compute the nesting levels of the brackets and hence cannot accurately determine the minimum number of colors needed.

3. **Conditions for Correct Text**: The conditions for determining whether the text is correct (i.e., whether it forms a correct bracket sequence) are not fully implemented. The program checks for some basic conditions but does not handle the full set of rules for a correct bracket sequence.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the result after each command, but the logic to determine the minimum number of colors is not correctly implemented. It does not correctly account for the nested nature of brackets and the requirement to color them differently based on nesting.

To meet the requirements, the program needs to:
- Properly track the nesting level of brackets.
- Use the minimum number of colors to color the brackets based on their nesting.
- Ensure that the text remains a correct bracket sequence after each command.

Here is a brief outline of how the correct implementation would look:

```python
import sys

def func():
    n = int(input())
    operations = input()
    ans_list = []
    
    stack = []
    cursor_pos = 0
    
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'L':
            cursor_pos = max(0, cursor_pos - 1)
        elif op == 'R':
            cursor_pos += 1
        else:
            if op in '()':
                stack.append((op, cursor_pos))
            else:
                if stack and stack[-1][0] == '(' and op == ')':
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append((op, cursor_pos))
        
        if not stack:
            ans_list.append(-1)
        else:
            max_depth = 0
            for _, pos in stack:
                if abs(cursor_pos - pos) > max_depth:
                    max_depth = abs(cursor_pos - pos)
            ans_list.append(max_depth + 1)
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans_list)))

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Uses a stack to track the positions of open and close brackets.
- Updates the maximum depth of nesting and uses it to determine the minimum number of colors required.
- Ensures the text remains a correct bracket sequence after each command.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly implement the requirements and hence is incorrect.
