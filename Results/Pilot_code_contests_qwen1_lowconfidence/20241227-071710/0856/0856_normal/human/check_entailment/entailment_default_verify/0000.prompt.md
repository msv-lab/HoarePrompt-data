You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The development of a text editor is a hard problem. You need to implement an extra module for brackets coloring in text.

Your editor consists of a line with infinite length and cursor, which points to the current character. Please note that it points to only one of the characters (and not between a pair of characters). Thus, it points to an index character. The user can move the cursor left or right one position. If the cursor is already at the first (leftmost) position, then it does not move left.

Initially, the cursor is in the first (leftmost) character.

Also, the user can write a letter or brackets (either (, or )) to the position that the cursor is currently pointing at. A new character always overwrites the old value at that position.

Your editor must check, whether the current line is the correct text. Text is correct if the brackets in them form the correct bracket sequence.

Formally, correct text (CT) must satisfy the following rules: 

  * any line without brackets is CT (the line can contain whitespaces); 
  * If the first character of the string — is (, the last — is ), and all the rest form a CT, then the whole line is a CT; 
  * two consecutively written CT is also CT. 



Examples of correct texts: hello(codeforces), round, ((i)(write))edi(tor)s, ( me). Examples of incorrect texts: hello)oops(, round), ((me).

The user uses special commands to work with your editor. Each command has its symbol, which must be written to execute this command.

The correspondence of commands and characters is as follows: 

  * L — move the cursor one character to the left (remains in place if it already points to the first character); 
  * R — move the cursor one character to the right; 
  * any lowercase Latin letter or bracket (( or )) — write the entered character to the position where the cursor is now. 



For a complete understanding, take a look at the first example and its illustrations in the note below.

You are given a string containing the characters that the user entered. For the brackets coloring module's work, after each command you need to:

  * check if the current text in the editor is a correct text; 
  * if it is, print the least number of colors that required, to color all brackets. 



If two pairs of brackets are nested (the first in the second or vice versa), then these pairs of brackets should be painted in different colors. If two pairs of brackets are not nested, then they can be painted in different or the same colors. For example, for the bracket sequence ()(())()() the least number of colors is 2, and for the bracket sequence (()(()())())(()) — is 3.

Write a program that prints the minimal number of colors after processing each command.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of commands. 

The second line contains s — a sequence of commands. The string s consists of n characters. It is guaranteed that all characters in a string are valid commands.

Output

In a single line print n integers, where the i-th number is:

  * -1 if the line received after processing the first i commands is not valid text, 
  * the minimal number of colors in the case of the correct text. 

Examples

Input


11
(RaRbR)L)L(


Output


-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 2 

Input


11
(R)R(R)Ra)c


Output


-1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 1 1 1 -1 1 

Note

In the first example, the text in the editor will take the following form:

  1.     (  
    ^

  2.     (  
     ^

  3.     (a  
     ^

  4.     (a  
      ^

  5.     (ab  
      ^

  6.     (ab  
       ^

  7.     (ab)  
       ^

  8.     (ab)  
      ^

  9.     (a))  
      ^

  10.     (a))  
     ^

  11.     (())  
     ^

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the conditions for determining whether the text is a correct text and calculating the minimum number of colors needed for bracket coloring. Specifically, the logic for checking the correctness of the text and calculating the minimum number of colors is flawed.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Bracket Sequence Validation**: The logic for checking if the text forms a correct bracket sequence is incomplete. The current implementation only checks the balance of parentheses and does not fully validate the nested structure.

2. **Minimum Number of Colors Calculation**: The calculation of the minimum number of colors is incorrect. The logic used to determine `left_max` and `right_max` is not appropriate for calculating the minimum number of colors needed to color the brackets.

To illustrate the issues, consider the following test case:

### Test Case

**Input:**
```
11
(R)aRaR)b)b)b)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
```

However, the output from the provided code is:
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This indicates that the code incorrectly identifies the text as valid at certain points and miscalculates the minimum number of colors.

### Detailed Issues:

1. **Validation Logic**: The validation logic does not fully check for the correct nested structure of the parentheses. For example, in the input `( ( ) )`, the current code would incorrectly identify it as valid but does not properly calculate the minimum number of colors.

2. **Color Calculation**: The logic for calculating the minimum number of colors is overly simplistic and does not account for the nested structure of the parentheses. For instance, in the input `((()))`, the current code would return `1`, which is incorrect because it needs `2` colors to properly distinguish the nested pairs.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a series of commands represented as a string `s`. Each command can be one of the following: 'L' (move the cursor left), 'R' (move the cursor right), or a lowercase Latin letter which is stored in the `context` list. During processing, it maintains several lists (`left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `left_max`, `right_max`) to track the cumulative sums, minimum, and maximum values of the `context` list up to and from the current cursor position. It iterates through the commands and updates these lists accordingly. After processing all commands, it determines the maximum value among certain conditions and appends it to `ans_list`. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans_list` separated by spaces. The function handles edge cases such as invalid commands and ensures the cursor position stays within valid bounds (1 to `n`). If no valid condition is met, it appends -1 to `ans_list`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
