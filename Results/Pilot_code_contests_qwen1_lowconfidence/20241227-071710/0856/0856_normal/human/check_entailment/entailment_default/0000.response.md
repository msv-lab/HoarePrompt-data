Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine whether the text in the editor forms a correct bracket sequence at each step. Specifically, the logic for checking if the text is a correct text is flawed. The conditions used to determine if the text is correct and the minimal number of colors required are not properly implemented.

For instance, consider the following sequence of commands:
```
(R)R(R)Ra)c
```

- After the first command `(`, the text is `(`, which is correct. The minimal number of colors needed is 1.
- After the second command `R`, the text is `( )`, which is correct. The minimal number of colors needed is 1.
- After the third command `R`, the text is `( ) )`, which is incorrect because the brackets are not properly closed. The code should return -1 at this point, but it does not.

The code checks the balance of parentheses using cumulative sums (`left_sum` and `right_sum`), but it does not correctly ensure that the text remains a correct bracket sequence at each step. Additionally, the conditions for determining the minimal number of colors are not fully implemented and do not cover all edge cases, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
