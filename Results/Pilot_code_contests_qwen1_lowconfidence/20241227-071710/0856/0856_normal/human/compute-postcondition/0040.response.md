Postcondition: ***`ans` is -1, `n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')' with one character removed, `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is a list containing -1, `operator_map` is a dictionary with keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum[1]` is 0 (if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`), `left_sum[1]` is `operator_map['L']` if 'L' is a key in `operator_map`, `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_min[1]` is 0, `right_min[1]` is 0, `right_max[1]` is 0, if `op == 'L'`, `cursor_pos` is 1, otherwise `cursor_pos` is 2, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_max[1]` is 0, and `op_val` is either the value of `operator_map[op]` if `op` is a key in `operator_map`, or 0 if `op` is not a key in `operator_map`.***
