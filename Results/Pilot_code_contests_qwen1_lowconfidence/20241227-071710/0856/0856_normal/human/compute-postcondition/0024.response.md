The code updates the `right_sum` list such that each element `right_sum[cursor_pos]` is set to the sum of itself and the next element in the list, i.e., `right_sum[cursor_pos + 1]`. Given that the initial state of `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, this operation does not change the values of `right_sum` since adding zero to zero remains zero.

Therefore, the value of `cursor_pos` remains unchanged at 1, and the rest of the variables are not affected by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0 with `left_sum[1] = operator_map['L']` (or 0 if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`), `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0.**
