The code `context = [(0) for i in xrange(n + 2)]` initializes the variable `context` as a list of length `n + 2` with each element set to 0. This affects the `context` variable, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\); `operations` is the string input by the user; `s` has not been read yet; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0.**
