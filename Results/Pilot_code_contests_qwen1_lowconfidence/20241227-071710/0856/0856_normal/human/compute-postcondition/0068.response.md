Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value found based on the conditions specified in the loop, `ans_list` is a list containing all the values of `ans` for each iteration, `n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `operator_map` is a dictionary with keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that position in the `context` list, `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements starting from that position in the `context` list, `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the minimum value encountered from the start up to that position in the `context` list, `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the minimum value encountered from that position to the end in the `context` list, `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element is the maximum value encountered from that position to the end in the `context` list, `cursor_pos` is the current position in the `context` list, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element represents the value of the corresponding operation in the `operations` string.**
