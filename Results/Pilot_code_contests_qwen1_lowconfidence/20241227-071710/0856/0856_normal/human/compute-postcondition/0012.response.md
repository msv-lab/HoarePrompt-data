According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `op`, which is derived from the string `operations`. The loop will execute if `operations` is a non-empty string containing characters that are either '(' or ')'. 

Before the loop starts, the following conditions must be met:
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\).
- `operations` is a string input by the user containing only the characters '(' and ')' (since these are the only valid characters used in the operations).
- `s` has not been read yet (this can be implied as it is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `ans_list` is an empty list.
- `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values.
- `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, and `right_max` are lists of length `n + 2` initialized to 0.
- `cursor_pos` is set to 1.
- `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0.

Since `op` is derived from `operations` and the loop will iterate over each character in `operations`, `operations` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, and `right_max` are lists of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, and `operations` must contain at least one character**.
