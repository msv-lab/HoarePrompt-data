The code assigns `left_min[cursor_pos]` the value of the minimum between `left_min[cursor_pos - 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`. Since `cursor_pos` is initially set to 1, `left_min[cursor_pos - 1]` corresponds to `left_min[0]`, which is not defined in the initial state and thus defaults to 0 (as per the standard initialization). The value of `context[cursor_pos]` is also not specified in the initial state and is considered as 0 by default.

Therefore, `left_min[1]` is set to `min(0, 0)`, which is 0.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0 with `left_sum[1] = operator_map['L']` (or 0 if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`), `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with `left_min[1]` being 0, `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0.**
