The code initializes `right_min` as a list of length `n + 2` with all elements set to 0. This impacts the initial state by updating the value of `right_min`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\); `operations` is the string input by the user; `s` has not been read yet; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0.**
