The code assigns the value returned by `operator_map.get(op, 0)` to `op_val`. This means `op_val` will be the value associated with `op` in `operator_map` if it exists, otherwise it will be 0. The variables `ans` and `ans_list` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`ans` is updated, `ans_list` is updated, `op_val` is either the value from `operator_map[op]` if `op` is in `operator_map`, else 0, `op` is the next character in `operations` if any**
