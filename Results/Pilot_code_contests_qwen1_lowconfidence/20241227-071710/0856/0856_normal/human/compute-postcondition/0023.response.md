The code updates `left_sum[cursor_pos]` by adding `context[cursor_pos]` to `left_sum[cursor_pos - 1]`. Given that `cursor_pos` is initially set to 1, the equation simplifies to:

- `left_sum[1] = left_sum[0] + context[1]`

Since `left_sum` and `context` are both initialized to 0, the value of `left_sum[0]` is 0. Also, since `cursor_pos` is 1, `context[1]` is the value from `operator_map['L']` (or 0 if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`).

Thus, `left_sum[1]` is calculated as:

- `left_sum[1] = 0 + context[1] = context[1]`

Therefore, the value of `left_sum[1]` is `context[1]`, which is `operator_map['L']` (or 0 if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`).

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0 with `left_sum[1] = operator_map['L']` (or 0 if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`), `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `right_max` are lists of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0.**
