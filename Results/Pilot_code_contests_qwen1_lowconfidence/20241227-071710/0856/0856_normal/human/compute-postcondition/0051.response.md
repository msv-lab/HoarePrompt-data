Let's break down the state step by step to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `ans` is -1
- `ans_list` is [-1]
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\)
- `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')' with one character removed
- `s` has not been read yet
- `operator_map` is a dictionary with keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values
- `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is now `right_sum[cursor_pos + 1]`
- `left_sum[1]` is `0` or `operator_map['L']` if 'L' is a key in `operator_map`
- `right_sum` is a length `n + 2` list with `right_sum[1]` updated to `right_sum[2]` if `cursor_pos` is 1, or `right_sum[2]` unchanged if `cursor_pos` is 2
- `left_min[1]` is `0`
- `right_min[1]` is `0`
- `right_min[2]` is `0`
- `right_max[1]` is `0`
- `cursor_pos` is `1` or `2`
- `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to `0`
- `left_max[1]` is `0`
- `left_min[2]` is `0`
- `right_max[2]` is `0`
- `left_max[2]` is `0`
- `op_val` is either the value of `operator_map[op]` if `op` is a key in `operator_map`, or `0` if `op` is not a key in `operator_map`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for op in operations:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters in `operations` to process. Therefore, the loop can continue if `operations` still contains at least one character.

2. **Adjusting States**:
   - `ans` and `ans_list` will change based on the processing of `op` within the loop. However, since we don't know the exact operations, these will be updated inside the loop body.
   - `n`, `operator_map`, `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `right_max`, `left_max`, `cursor_pos`, `context`, and `op_val` will be updated based on the specific operation `op`.
   - `s` will be read during the loop, but its initial state does not affect the loop continuation condition directly.

### Step-by-Step Adjustments:

- `op`: The current operation `op` from `operations` will be processed in the loop body.
- Since `op` could be either '(', ')', or one of the special characters, it affects the internal states like `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `right_max`, `left_max`, and `context`.

### Updated State:

- `ans` and `ans_list` will be updated by the loop body, so we cannot predict their exact values without knowing the loop body.
- The other variables will depend on the specific operation `op`.

### Final State Before Next Iteration:

Since we don't have the loop body, we can only say that the next state will depend on the next `op` in `operations`.

**State:**
- `ans` is updated (but its new value is unknown without the loop body).
- `ans_list` is updated (but its new value is unknown without the loop body).
- `op` is the next character in `operations` (if any).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
**`ans` is updated, `ans_list` is updated, `op` is the next character in `operations` if any**.

Given this, we can summarize the final answer as follows:

**State: **`ans` is updated, `ans_list` is updated, `op` is the next character in `operations` if any**.
