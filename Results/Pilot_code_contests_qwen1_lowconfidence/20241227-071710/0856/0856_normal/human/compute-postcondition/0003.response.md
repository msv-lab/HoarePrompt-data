The code initializes a dictionary `operator_map` where the keys are parentheses and the values are 1 for '(' and -1 for ')'. The variables `n`, `operations`, and `s` remain unchanged, and `ans_list` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is the string input by the user, `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, and `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}.**
