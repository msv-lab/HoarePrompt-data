The code `cursor_pos += 1` increments the value of `cursor_pos` by 1. Initially, `cursor_pos` is set to 1. After the increment, the new value of `cursor_pos` will be 2.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, and `right_max` are lists of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `cursor_pos` is 2, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `op` is equal to 'R', `operations` must contain at least one character.**
