The code sets the variable `cursor_pos` to 1. This means that the cursor position is now set to 1, but no other variables have been affected. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\); `operations` is the string input by the user; `s` has not been read yet; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}; `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `right_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0; `cursor_pos` is 1.**
