Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\); `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')'; `s` has not been read yet; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values; `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `right_max` are lists of length `n + 2` initialized to 0; `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `op` is 'R' or not; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, and if `op` is 'R', then `context[1]` is set to `op_val` where `op_val` is the value from `operator_map[op]` if `op` is a key in `operator_map`, otherwise `0`.***
