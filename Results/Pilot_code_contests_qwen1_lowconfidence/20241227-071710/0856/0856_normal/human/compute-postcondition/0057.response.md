Postcondition: **`ans` is updated, `ans_list` is updated, `op` is the next character in `operations` if any. If `op` equals 'L', `cursor_pos` is the maximum of 1 and its previous value minus 1. If `op` equals 'R', `cursor_pos` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `op_val` is either the value from `operator_map[op]` if `op` is in `operator_map`, else 0, and `context[cursor_pos]` is updated to `op_val`.**
