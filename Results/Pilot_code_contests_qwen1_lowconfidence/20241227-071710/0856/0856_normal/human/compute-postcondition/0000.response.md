The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of commands that will follow in the next line. The initial state provides that `n` (the number of commands) is an integer between 1 and 10^6. After executing this line, the value of `n` is known, and the string `s` containing the commands has not yet been read.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, within the range 1 to 10^6, and the string `s` of commands has not been read yet.**
