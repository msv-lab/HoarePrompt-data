The code updates the variable `cursor_pos` by setting it to the maximum of 1 and `cursor_pos - 1`. Since `cursor_pos` is being updated but the exact initial value of `cursor_pos` is not given, we know that `cursor_pos` will be set to the maximum between 1 and its previous value minus 1. If `cursor_pos` was originally greater than 1, it will be decremented by 1, but it will never go below 1 due to the `max` function.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated, `ans_list` is updated, `op` is the next character in `operations` if any, `cursor_pos` is the maximum of 1 and its previous value minus 1.

Output State: **`ans` is updated, `ans_list` is updated, `op` is the next character in `operations` if any, `cursor_pos` is the maximum of 1 and its previous value minus 1**
