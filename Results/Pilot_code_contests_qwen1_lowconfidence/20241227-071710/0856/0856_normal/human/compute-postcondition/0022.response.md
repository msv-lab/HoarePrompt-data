Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, and `right_max` are lists of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0. If `op` is 'L', `cursor_pos` remains 1. If `op` is 'R', `cursor_pos` is set to 2 and `context[1]` is set to the value from `operator_map[op]` if `op` is a key in `operator_map`, otherwise `0`.***
