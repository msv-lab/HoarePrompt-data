The code initializes an empty list `ans_list`. The values of `n` and `operations` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `s` is not read yet. 

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is the string input by the user, `s` has not been read yet, and `ans_list` is an empty list.**
