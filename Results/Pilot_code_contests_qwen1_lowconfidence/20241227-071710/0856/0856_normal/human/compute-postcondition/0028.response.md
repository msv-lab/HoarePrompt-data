The code updates `right_max[cursor_pos]` with the maximum value between `right_max[cursor_pos + 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`. Given the initial state, `cursor_pos` is 1, so this line of code becomes:

```python
right_max[1] = max(right_max[2], context[1])
```

Since `right_max[2]` is initialized to 0 and `context[1]` is initialized to 0, the value of `max(right_max[2], context[1])` is 0. Therefore, `right_max[1]` remains 0.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum[1]` is 0 (if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`), `left_sum[1]` is `operator_map['L']` if 'L' is a key in `operator_map`, `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with `left_min[1]` being 0, `right_min[1]` is 0, `right_max[1]` is 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_max[1]` is 0.**
