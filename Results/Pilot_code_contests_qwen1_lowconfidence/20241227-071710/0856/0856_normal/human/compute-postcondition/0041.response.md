The code updates the value of `left_sum[cursor_pos]` based on the previous value of `left_sum[cursor_pos - 1]` and the current value of `context[cursor_pos]`. Given the initial state, we know:

- `cursor_pos` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether `op` is 'L' or not.
- `context[cursor_pos]` is part of the initial setup but its exact value isn't specified.

Since the initial state does not provide the exact value of `context[cursor_pos]`, we'll denote it as `context[cursor_pos]` for now. The value of `left_sum[cursor_pos - 1]` would be 0 because `left_sum[1]` is 0 (or `operator_map['L']` if 'L' is a key in `operator_map`) and `cursor_pos` is being updated from 1 to 2 or vice versa, making `cursor_pos - 1` 0.

Thus, the calculation for `left_sum[cursor_pos]` becomes:
- If `cursor_pos` is 1: `left_sum[1] = 0 + context[1]`
- If `cursor_pos` is 2: `left_sum[2] = 0 + context[2]`

Given these conditions, the updated values are:
- `left_sum[cursor_pos] = context[cursor_pos]`

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is -1, `n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')' with one character removed, `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is a list containing -1, `operator_map` is a dictionary with keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is `context[cursor_pos]`, `left_sum[1]` is 0 (if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`), `left_sum[1]` is `operator_map['L']` if 'L' is a key in `operator_map`, `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_min[1]` is 0, `right_min[1]` is 0, `right_max[1]` is 0, if `op == 'L'`, `cursor_pos` is 1, otherwise `cursor_pos` is 2, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_max[1]` is 0, and `op_val` is either the value of `operator_map[op]` if `op` is a key in `operator_map`, or 0 if `op` is not a key in `operator_map`.**
