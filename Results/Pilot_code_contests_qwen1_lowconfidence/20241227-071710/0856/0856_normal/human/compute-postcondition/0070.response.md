The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input stream, specifically:
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the number of commands.
- The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is a valid command (L, R, lowercase Latin letter, (, or )).

Based on the given input, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be described as accepting input consisting of an integer `n` followed by a string `s` and processing this input according to the specified commands.

Functionality: **The function accepts input consisting of an integer `n` followed by a string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is a valid command (L, R, lowercase Latin letter, (, or )).**
