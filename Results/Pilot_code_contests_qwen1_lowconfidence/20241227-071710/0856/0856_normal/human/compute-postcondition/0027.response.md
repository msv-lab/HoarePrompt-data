The code snippet updates the value of `left_max[cursor_pos]` by taking the maximum value between `left_max[cursor_pos - 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`. The `cursor_pos` is 1, so the updated value of `left_max[cursor_pos]` will be the maximum of `left_max[0]` (which is 0 since `left_max` is initialized to 0) and `context[1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\),
- `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')',
- `s` has not been read yet,
- `ans_list` is an empty list,
- `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values,
- `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0 with `left_sum[1] = operator_map['L']` (or 0 if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`),
- `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0,
- `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with `left_min[1]` being 0,
- `right_min[1]` is 0,
- `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0,
- `cursor_pos` is 1,
- `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0.

After executing the code snippet, the following changes occur:
- `left_max[1]` is updated to be the maximum of `left_max[0]` (which is 0) and `context[1]` (which is 0 initially).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0 with `left_sum[1] = operator_map['L']` (or 0 if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`), `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with `left_min[1]` being 0, `right_min[1]` is 0, `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_max[1]` is 0.**
