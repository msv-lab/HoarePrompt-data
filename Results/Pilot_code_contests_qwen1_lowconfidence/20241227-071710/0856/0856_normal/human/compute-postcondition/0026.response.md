The code snippet updates `right_min[cursor_pos]` to be the minimum of `right_min[cursor_pos + 1]` and `context[cursor_pos]`. Given the initial state, `cursor_pos` is 1, so this operation updates `right_min[1]`.

Since `right_min` is initialized to 0 at all positions, initially `right_min[1]` is 0. The value of `context[1]` is also 0 because `context` is initialized to 0 at all positions. Therefore, the minimum of `right_min[2]` (which is 0) and `context[1]` (which is 0) is still 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0 with `left_sum[1] = operator_map['L']` (or 0 if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`), `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_min` is a list of length `n + 2` with `left_min[1]` being 0, `right_min[1]` is 0, `right_max` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0.**
