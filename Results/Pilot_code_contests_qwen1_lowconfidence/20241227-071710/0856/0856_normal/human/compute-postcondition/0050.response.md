The code appends the current value of `ans` to `ans_list`. Since `ans` was `-1` and no conditions inside the if-else block change its value, `ans` remains `-1`.

All other variables remain unchanged because there is no operation that affects them.

Output State: **`ans` is -1, `ans_list` is [-1], `n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')' with one character removed, `s` has not been read yet, `operator_map` is a dictionary with keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is now `right_sum[cursor_pos + 1]`, `left_sum[1]` is `0` or `operator_map['L']` if 'L' is a key in `operator_map`, `right_sum` is a length `n + 2` list with `right_sum[1]` updated to `right_sum[2]` if `cursor_pos` is 1, or `right_sum[2]` unchanged if `cursor_pos` is 2, `left_min[1]` is `0`, `right_min[1]` is `0`, `right_min[2]` is `0`, `right_max[1]` is `0`, `cursor_pos` is `1` or `2`, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to `0`, `left_max[1]` is `0`, `left_min[2]` is `0`, `right_max[2]` is `0`, `left_max[2]` is `0`, `op_val` is either the value of `operator_map[op]` if `op` is a key in `operator_map`, or `0` if `op` is not a key in `operator_map`.**
