Postcondition: ***`ans` is -1, `n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum[1]` is 0 (if 'L' is not a key in `operator_map`), `left_sum[1]` is `operator_map['L']` if 'L' is a key in `operator_map`, `right_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_min[1]` is 0, `right_min[1]` is 0, `right_max[1]` is 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `left_max[1]` is 0. Additionally, if the condition `left_sum[cursor_pos] + right_sum[cursor_pos + 1] == 0` and `left_min[cursor_pos] >= 0` and `right_min[cursor_pos] >= 0` is satisfied, then `ans` becomes 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains -1.***
