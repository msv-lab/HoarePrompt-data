The code assigns the value of `op_val` to `context[cursor_pos]`. Since `op_val` is the value from `operator_map[op]` if `op` is a key in `operator_map`, otherwise `0`, and `op` is not equal to 'R', `op_val` is determined by the value in `operator_map[op]`. However, the exact value of `op_val` depends on what `op` is. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `context[cursor_pos]` is set to `op_val`.
- All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\); `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')'; `s` has not been read yet; `ans_list` is an empty list; `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values; `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, `right_max` are lists of length `n + 2` initialized to 0; `cursor_pos` is 1; `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, and `context[1]` is set to `op_val`; `op` is not equal to 'R'; `operations` must contain at least one character; `op_val` is the value from `operator_map[op]` if `op` is a key in `operator_map`, otherwise `0`.**
