Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, let's analyze the impact step by step.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is `-1`.
- `n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\).
- `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')' with one character removed.
- `s` has not been read yet.
- `ans_list` is a list containing `-1`.
- `operator_map` is a dictionary with keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values.
- `left_sum[cursor_pos]` is now `right_sum[cursor_pos + 1]`.
- `left_sum[1]` is `0`.
- `left_sum[1]` is `operator_map['L']` if 'L' is a key in `operator_map`.
- `right_sum` is a length `n + 2` list with `right_sum[1]` updated to `right_sum[2]` if `cursor_pos` is 1, or `right_sum[2]` unchanged if `cursor_pos` is 2.
- `left_min[1]` is `0`.
- `right_min[1]` is `0`.
- `right_min[2]` is `0`.
- `right_max[1]` is `0`.
- `cursor_pos` is `1` or `2`.
- `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to `0`.
- `left_max[1]` is `0`.
- `left_min[2]` is `0`.
- `op_val` is either the value of `operator_map[op]` if `op` is a key in `operator_map`, or `0` if `op` is not a key in `operator_map`.
- `left_max[2]` is `0`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
right_max[cursor_pos] = max(right_max[cursor_pos + 1], context[cursor_pos])
```

### Analysis:
- For `cursor_pos` being `1`:
  - `right_max[1]` is updated to `max(right_max[2], context[1])`.
  - Since `context[1]` is `0` (as per the initial state), and assuming `right_max[2]` is also `0` (since it hasn't been updated yet), `right_max[1]` remains `0`.

- For `cursor_pos` being `2`:
  - `right_max[2]` is updated to `max(right_max[3], context[2])`.
  - Since `context[2]` is `0` (as per the initial state), and assuming `right_max[3]` is also `0` (since it hasn't been updated yet), `right_max[2]` remains `0`.

### Output State:
- All the values remain the same as the initial state since no actual change was made due to `context[cursor_pos]` being `0`.
