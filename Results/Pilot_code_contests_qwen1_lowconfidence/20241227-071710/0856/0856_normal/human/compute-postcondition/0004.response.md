The code initializes a list `left_sum` with `n + 2` elements, each set to 0. The values of `n`, `operations`, `s`, `ans_list`, and `operator_map` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is the string input by the user, `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is {'(': 1, ')': -1}, `left_sum` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0.**
