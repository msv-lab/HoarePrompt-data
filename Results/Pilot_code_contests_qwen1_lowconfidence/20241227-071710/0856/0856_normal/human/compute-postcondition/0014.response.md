The code changes the value of `cursor_pos` by subtracting 1 from its current value and ensures it does not go below 1. Given the initial state, `cursor_pos` starts at 1. Subtracting 1 from 1 results in 0, but since the minimum allowed value for `cursor_pos` is 1, the value remains 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to \(10^6\), `operations` is a non-empty string containing only the characters '(', ')', `s` has not been read yet, `ans_list` is an empty list, `operator_map` is a dictionary with the keys '(', ')' and their corresponding values, `left_sum`, `right_sum`, `left_min`, `right_min`, and `right_max` are lists of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, `cursor_pos` is 1, `context` is a list of length `n + 2` initialized to 0, and `op` is equal to 'L'.**
