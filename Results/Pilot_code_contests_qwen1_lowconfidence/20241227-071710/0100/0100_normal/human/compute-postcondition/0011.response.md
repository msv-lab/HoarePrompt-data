First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State: 
  - `b` is `[a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`
  - `n` is greater than 1
  - `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)`
  - The program printed `2` and the value of `n`

The code snippet is:
```
a[i] += b[i - 1]
```

### Step-by-step analysis:
1. **Identify the value of `b[i - 1]`:**
   - From the initial state, `b` is defined as `[a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`.
   - Therefore, `b[i - 1]` is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

2. **Update `a[i]`:**
   - The code snippet `a[i] += b[i - 1]` means that `a[i]` is incremented by the value of `b[i - 1]`.
   - So, `a[i]` is now `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

3. **Other variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it was already specified to be greater than 1.
   - `b` is a list with one element which is not further referenced in the code.
   - `a` is updated according to the function `func_2()` and the specific value of `a[0]`.

### Output State:
- `b` remains as `[a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `a` is updated such that `a[i]` is now `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
- The program printed `2` and the value of `n`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`b` is `[a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, and the program printed `2` and the value of `n`.**
