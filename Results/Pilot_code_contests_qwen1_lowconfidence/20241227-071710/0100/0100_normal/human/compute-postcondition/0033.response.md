The code snippet `print(*a)` prints the elements of the list `a`. Given the initial state where `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\) and for all `j` in the range \(0 \leq j < n\), `a[j]` is \(-a[j]\), this implies that each element in the list `a` is negated. Since the initial state does not specify the actual values of the elements in `a`, we know that each element will be its negation.

The print statement will output the negated values of the elements in `a`. However, the actual values of the elements are not specified in the initial state, so we can only state that each element in `a` has been negated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), for all `j` in the range \(0 \leq j < n\), `a[j]` is the negation of the original value of `a[j]`. The list `a` has been printed with these negated values.**
