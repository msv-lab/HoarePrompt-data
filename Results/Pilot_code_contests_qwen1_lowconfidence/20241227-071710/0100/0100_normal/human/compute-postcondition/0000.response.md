The code `n = func_4()` assigns the return value of `func_4()` to `n`. However, since `func_4()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact behavior or return value. The only thing we know is that `n` will be assigned an integer value between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, based on what `func_4()` returns.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a` is a list of n integers such that -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `a` is a list of n integers such that -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
