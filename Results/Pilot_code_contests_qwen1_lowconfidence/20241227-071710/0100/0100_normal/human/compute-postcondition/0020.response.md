Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)`; `a[0] % n` is 0; for each `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + b[i-1]` where `b[i-1] = a[i-1] % n * (n - 1)`; if `n > 1`, then `b` is a list of length `n` where each element `b[i] = a[i] % n * (n - 1)`; otherwise, no further updates are made to `a` or `b`.***
