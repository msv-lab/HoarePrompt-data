The code prints the value of `n - x`. Here, `x` is defined as `a[0] % n`, where `a` is the return value of `func_2()`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `x` is updated based on the return value of `func_2()`.

Since the return value of `func_2()` and the exact value of `n` are not specified, we can denote the return value of `func_2()` as `b`. Therefore, `a[0]` would be the first element of the list returned by `func_2()`, which is `b[0]`.

So, `x` is calculated as `b[0] % n`. The code then prints `n - x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `x` is `a[0] % n`, and the output is `n - x`.**
