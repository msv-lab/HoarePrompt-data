The code `a = func_2()` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `a`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact values or type of `a`. However, we know that initially, `a` was a list of `n` integers, and now it has been replaced by whatever `func_2()` returns.

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). After the code execution, the value of `n` remains unchanged, but `a` is now whatever `func_2()` returns.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `a` is the return value of `func_2()`**
