First, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` with `a[0] % n` being 0, which means `a[0]` remains unchanged because `a[0] % n` is 0.
- For each `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + b[i-1]` where `b[i-1] = a[i-1] % n * (n - 1)`, and since `n == 1`, no further updates are made to `a` or `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `n`: an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `a`: a list with at least one element `a[0]`.
   - `b`: a list with length `n` where each element `b[i] = a[i] % n * (n - 1)` if `n > 1`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The print statement outputs `1 1`. This does not affect the variables `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Since the print statement does not modify any variables, the only changes are the output from the print statement. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were in the initial state.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `a[0]` remains unchanged.
- For each `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` remains unchanged because no updates are made due to the condition `n == 1`.
- `b` is a list where each element `b[i] = a[i] % n * (n - 1)` if `n > 1`, but since `n == 1`, no updates are made to `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `a[0]` is unchanged, for each `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` is unchanged, and `b` is unchanged.**
