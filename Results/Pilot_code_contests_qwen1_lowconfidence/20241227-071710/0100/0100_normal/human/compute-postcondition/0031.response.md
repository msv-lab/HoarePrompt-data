The code updates the value of `a[i]` to `-a[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, the line `a[i] = -a[i]` will update `a[2]` to `-a[2]`.

Since the initial state also mentions `a[1]` is \(-a[1]\), this implies that `a[1]` is 0 (because the only number that is equal to its own negation is 0). 

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a[0]` remains 0
- `a[1]` remains 0
- `a[2]` is updated to `-a[2]`

Given that no specific value was provided for `a[2]` initially, it remains as `-a[2]` after the operation. However, since the operation doesn't specify a new value for `a[2]` but rather negates its current value, we acknowledge that `a[2]` will be the negated version of whatever value it held before.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `i` is 2, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is `-a[2]`**
