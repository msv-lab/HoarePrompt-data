`b` initially contains the value `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`. The code appends `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` to the list `b`. Since `i` is an index within the range of `a` and is equal to `i + 1`, the value being appended is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, which is the same as `a[i + 1] % n * (n - 1)`.

After the append operation, the list `b` will contain three elements: the first two are from the initial state, and the third is the new value appended.

Output State: **`b` is `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1), a[i + 1] % n * (n - 1)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[n-1]` updated to `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`, `i` is an index within the range of `a` and is equal to `i + 1`**
