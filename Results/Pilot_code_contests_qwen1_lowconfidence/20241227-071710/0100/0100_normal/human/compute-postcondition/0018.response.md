Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `b` is an empty list.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`.
- `x = a[0] % n`.
- `a[0] = a[0] + n - x`.
- The program prints `2` and the value of `n`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    b.append(a[i] % n * (n - 1))
    a[i] += b[i - 1]
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization and First Iteration**:
   - Initially, `b` is an empty list.
   - The first iteration of the loop sets up `b[0] = a[0] % n * (n - 1)`.
   - The first element of `a` is updated: `a[0] = a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)`.

2. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each subsequent iteration `i` from `1` to `n-1`:
     - `b[i] = a[i] % n * (n - 1)` is appended to `b`.
     - `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + b[i-1]`.

### Final State after the Loop:
- **List `b`**: After all iterations, `b` will contain elements where each element `b[i]` is calculated as `a[i] % n * (n - 1)` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- **List `a`**: After all iterations, `a[0]` will be updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)`, and each `a[i]` for `1 <= i < n` will be updated to `a[i] + b[i-1]`.
- **Integer `n`**: Remains unchanged since no operations directly modify `n`.
- **Integer `a[0]`**: Updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)`.
- **List `a`**: Each element `a[i]` for `1 <= i < n` will be a sum involving the previous `b[i-1]`.

### Conclusion:
If the loop executes `n` times, the final state of the variables will be:
- `b` will be a list of length `n` where each element `b[i] = a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
- `a[0]` will be `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)`.
- Each `a[i]` for `1 <= i < n` will be updated according to the formula `a[i] += b[i-1]`.
- `n` remains unchanged and is a positive integer within the specified range.

### Output State:
Output State: **`b` is a list of length `n` where each element `b[i] = a[i] % n * (n - 1)`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)`, each `a[i]` for `1 <= i < n` is updated to `a[i] + b[i-1]`, `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).**
