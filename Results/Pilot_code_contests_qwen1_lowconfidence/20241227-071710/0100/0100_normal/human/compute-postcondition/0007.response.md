The code prints `2` and the value of `n`. The print statement does not change the values of the variables but outputs them. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `a` and `x` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state includes the printed values along with the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `x` is `a[0] % n`, `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`, and the program prints `2` and the value of `n`.**
