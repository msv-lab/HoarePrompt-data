The code snippet updates the value of `a[i]` to `-a[i]`. However, the initial state does not define what `a` is or what index `i` refers to. Given that `i` is initialized to 0, we assume that `a` is an array or list, and `a[0]` is being updated. Since the initial state only mentions `n` as an integer within the specified range and `i` as 0, we focus on these variables.

- `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation.
- `i` remains 0 because the code does not modify it.
- `a[0]` is updated to `-a[0]`.

The output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `i` is 0, `a[0]` is -`a[0]`.**
