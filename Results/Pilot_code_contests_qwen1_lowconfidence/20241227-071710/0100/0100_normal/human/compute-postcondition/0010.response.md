Let's break down the given code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `b` is an empty list.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is the return value of `func_2()`.
   - `x` is `a[0] % n`.
   - `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`.
   - The program prints `2` and the value of `n`.

2. Code to Analyze:
   ```python
   b.append(a[i] % n * (n - 1))
   ```

3. Impact Analysis:
   - The code appends an element to the list `b`.
   - The element to be appended is calculated as `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
   - The value of `i` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact index being accessed from `a`. However, the code assumes that such an index exists.

4. Variables Before Execution:
   - `b` is an empty list.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` contains the return value of `func_2()`, which means `a` could be a list or a tuple of values.
   - `x` is `a[0] % n`.
   - `a[0]` has been updated to `a[0] + n - x`.

5. Variables After Execution:
   - `b` will contain one additional element, which is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged except for the modification of `a[0]` to `a[0] + n - x`.
   - The program prints `2` and the value of `n`, but these actions do not affect the variables.

Output State: **`b` is [a[i] % n * (n - 1)], `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)`, and the program printed `2` and the value of `n`.**
