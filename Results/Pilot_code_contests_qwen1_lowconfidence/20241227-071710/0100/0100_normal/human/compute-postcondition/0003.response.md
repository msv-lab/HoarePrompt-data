The code assigns the value of `a[0] % n` to `x`. Given the initial state, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), and `a` is the return value of `func_2()`. Since the exact value of `a` is not specified, `x` will be the remainder when the first element of `a` is divided by `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\); `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `x` is `a[0] % n`**
