First, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

1. `b` is defined as `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[n-1]` updated to `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`.
4. `i` is an index within the range of `a`.

The code snippet is:
```python
a[i] += b[i - 1]
```

This means that the value of `a[i]` is updated by adding `b[i - 1]` to it.

Since `b` is defined as `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`, the element `b[i - 1]` is the second element of the list `b`, which is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

So, the operation `a[i] += b[i - 1]` translates to:
```python
a[i] += a[i] % n * (n - 1)
```

Given that `a[i] % n` is a value between 0 and `n-1`, multiplying it by `(n - 1)` will give a value that is a multiple of `(n - 1)` and less than `n * (n - 1)`. Adding this to `a[i]` will adjust `a[i]` such that its remainder when divided by `n` is 0.

Therefore, the value of `a[i]` after the operation will be a multiple of `n`.

Output State: **`b` is `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[n-1]` updated to `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `a[i]` is a multiple of `n`.**
