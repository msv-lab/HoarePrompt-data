Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\). If `n == 1`, `a[0]` is unchanged, for each `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, and the output is `0`. Otherwise, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[0] % n` is `0`, for each `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + b[i-1]` where `b[i-1] = a[i-1] % n * (n - 1)`, and `b` is updated accordingly.***
