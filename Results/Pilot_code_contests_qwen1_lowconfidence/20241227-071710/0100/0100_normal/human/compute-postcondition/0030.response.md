Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `a[0]` is 0
   - `a[1]` is \(-a[1]\)

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**: Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

5. **State Adjustment**: Given that `i` is incremented by 1, it becomes 2. The variable `n` does not change based on the current loop condition alone. Therefore, `n` remains the same.

6. **Array `a` Values**: The values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` do not change within the loop based on the given information. Thus, they remain the same as in the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `i` is 2, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is \(-a[1]\)**.
