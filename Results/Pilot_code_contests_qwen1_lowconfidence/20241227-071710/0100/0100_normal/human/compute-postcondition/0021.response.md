Postcondition: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` with `a[0] % n` being 0, for each `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + b[i-1]` where `b[i-1] = a[i-1] % n * (n - 1)`, `b` is a list of length `n` where each element `b[i] = a[i] % n * (n - 1)` if `n > 1`, and since `n == 1`, no further updates are made to `a` or `b`.**
