The code prints `0`. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the only change is the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `a[0]` is unchanged, for each `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, print output is `0`**
