Let's break down the given code and initial state:

### Initial State:
- `b` is defined as `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1), a[i + 1] % n * (n - 1)]`.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, where `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`.
- `i` is an index within the range of `a` and is equal to `i + 1`.

### Code Execution:
The line of code is:
```python
a[i] += b[i - 1]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify `b[i - 1]`:**
   - Since `b` is `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1), a[i + 1] % n * (n - 1)]`, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`, this means `i - 1` corresponds to the second element in the list `b`.
   - Therefore, `b[i - 1]` is `a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

2. **Update `a[i]`:**
   - The line `a[i] += b[i - 1]` adds `b[i - 1]` to `a[i]`.
   - So, `a[i]` is now `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.

### Updated Values:
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

### Output State:
- `b` remains as `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1), a[i + 1] % n * (n - 1)]`.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `a` remains the return value of `func_2()` with the specified updates, but `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.

Output State: **`b` is `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1), a[i + 1] % n * (n - 1)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[n-1]` updated to `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`, `i` is an index within the range of `a` and is equal to `i + 1`; `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`**.
