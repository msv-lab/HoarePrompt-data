Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `b` is `[a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[i]` updated to `a[i] + a[i] % n * (n - 1)`
- The program printed `2` and the value of `n`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `n-1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

2. **Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than `n` because the loop just finished running for `i = n-1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop will run for `i = n-1`, we need to ensure that `i` is now `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same since the loop condition only increments `i` within the given range.
   - `b` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified within the loop itself but depend on the loop variable `i` and the value of `n`.

### Updated State:
- `b` is still `[a[i] % n * (n - 1)]` where `i` is `n-1`.
- `n` is still greater than 1.
- `a` remains the same as the return value of `func_2()` with the updates applied.
- The loop will run for `i = n-1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`b` is `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[n-1]` updated to `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`**.
