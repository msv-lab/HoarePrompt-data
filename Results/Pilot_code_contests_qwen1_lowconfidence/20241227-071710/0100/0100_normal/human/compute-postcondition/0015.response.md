Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `b` is `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[n-1]` updated to `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`
   - `i` is an index within the range of `a`
   - `a[i]` is a multiple of `n`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since we are considering the state at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `k` in the previous iteration where `1 â‰¤ k < n-1`.

4. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1` if `k < n-2`, or `n-1` if `k = n-2`.

5. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`. 

6. **State Adjustments:**
   - `b` remains the same since it is based on the values of `a[n-1]` and `a[i]` at the start of the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as the value does not change inside the loop.
   - `a` remains the same as it is only updated once before the loop starts.
   - `i` changes to `i + 1` for the next iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. If `i` was `n-2` in the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `n-1`.

State: **`b` is `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[n-1]` updated to `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`, `i` is an index within the range of `a` and is equal to `i + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we express it generally as `i` being incremented by 1.

State: **`b` is `[a[n-1] % n * (n - 1), a[i] % n * (n - 1)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the return value of `func_2()` with `a[0]` updated to `a[0] + n - (a[0] % n)` and `a[n-1]` updated to `a[n-1] + a[n-1] % n * (n - 1)`, `i` is an index within the range of `a` and is equal to `i + 1`**.
