The code initializes an empty list `b`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `x`, or the print statements. Therefore, the only changes are the creation of the empty list `b` and the print statements.

Output State: **`b` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `a` is the return value of `func_2()`, `x` is `a[0] % n`, `a[0]` is `a[0] + n - x`, and the program prints `2` and the value of `n`.**
