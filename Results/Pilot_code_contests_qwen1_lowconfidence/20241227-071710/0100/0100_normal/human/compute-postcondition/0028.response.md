Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a[0]` is \(-a[0]\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since the loop just ended, `i` is 0.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0, the condition `i < n` is true as long as `n > 0`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1.
   - There are no other state adjustments needed for the list `a` or the value of `n` since the problem does not specify any changes inside the loop body affecting these values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `i` is 1, `a[0]` is \(-a[0]\).**

State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `i` is 1, `a[0]` is \(-a[0]\)**
