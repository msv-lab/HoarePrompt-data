Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `i` is `n`, for all `j` in the range \(0 \leq j < n\), `a[j]` is \(-a[j]\)**

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is set to an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- For each iteration of the loop, the value of `a[i]` is updated to `-a[i]`. Therefore, after the loop, `a[j]` for all `j` in the range \(0 \leq j < n\) will be \(-a[j]\).

If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `n` is 0), the initial state remains unchanged:
- `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `i` will still be `n` (which would be 0 in this case).
- All elements in the array `a` will remain as their original values, which is consistent with the initial state where `a[0]` is 1.
