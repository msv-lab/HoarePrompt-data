The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns a map object. This map object contains integer values derived from splitting a string obtained from the function `func_3()` and converting each resulting substring into an integer. Potential edge cases include situations where `func_3()` returns an empty string or a string containing only whitespace, which would result in an empty map. Additionally, if `func_3()` returns a string with no substrings between delimiters, the map will also be empty. There is no missing functionality indicated in the provided code; however, the function assumes that `func_3()` returns a valid string.
