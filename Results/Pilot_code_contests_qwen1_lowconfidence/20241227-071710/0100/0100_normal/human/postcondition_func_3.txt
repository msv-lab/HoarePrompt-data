The function prompts the user to input an integer and returns that integer. The function does not perform any validation on the input, meaning it will accept any integer input from the user without checking if it falls within a specific range or meets other criteria. There are no preconditions specified, and the function does not modify any external variables. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer input by the user.
