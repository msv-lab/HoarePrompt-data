The function takes two inputs, `n` and `a`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. It performs several operations on these inputs and prints intermediate results. After executing all operations, the function updates the list `a` by negating all its elements and prints the final list. Specifically, it first calculates and prints `n - (a[0] % n)`, then for each element in `a` (except the first one), it adds to it a value derived from previous elements and the modulus operation. If `n` is greater than 1, it constructs and prints a list `b` based on these calculations. Finally, it negates all elements in `a` and prints the updated list. If `n` is 1, it simply prints `0`. This function does not return any value but modifies the list `a` in place.
