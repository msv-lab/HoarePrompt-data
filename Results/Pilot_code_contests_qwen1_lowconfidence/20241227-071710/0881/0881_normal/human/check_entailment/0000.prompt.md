You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innokentiy likes tea very much and today he wants to drink exactly n cups of tea. He would be happy to drink more but he had exactly n tea bags, a of them are green and b are black.

Innokentiy doesn't like to drink the same tea (green or black) more than k times in a row. Your task is to determine the order of brewing tea bags so that Innokentiy will be able to drink n cups of tea, without drinking the same tea more than k times in a row, or to inform that it is impossible. Each tea bag has to be used exactly once.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, a and b (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of cups of tea Innokentiy wants to drink, the maximum number of cups of same tea he can drink in a row, the number of tea bags of green and black tea. It is guaranteed that a + b = n.

Output

If it is impossible to drink n cups of tea, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print the string of the length n, which consists of characters 'G' and 'B'. If some character equals 'G', then the corresponding cup of tea should be green. If some character equals 'B', then the corresponding cup of tea should be black.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Program:

def func():
    vals = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    n = vals[0]
    k = vals[1]
    a = vals[2]
    b = vals[3]
    c = 0
    d = True
    if b > a:
        d = False
    s = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if c == k:
            d = not d
            c = 0
        if d:
            s += 'G'
            a -= 1
            c += 1
            if a < b:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        else:
            s += 'B'
            b -= 1
            c += 1
            if b < a:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        if a < 0 or b < 0:
            print('NO')
            quit()
    print(s)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
