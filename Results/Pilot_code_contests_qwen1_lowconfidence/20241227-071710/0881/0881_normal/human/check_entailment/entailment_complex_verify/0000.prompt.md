You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innokentiy likes tea very much and today he wants to drink exactly n cups of tea. He would be happy to drink more but he had exactly n tea bags, a of them are green and b are black.

Innokentiy doesn't like to drink the same tea (green or black) more than k times in a row. Your task is to determine the order of brewing tea bags so that Innokentiy will be able to drink n cups of tea, without drinking the same tea more than k times in a row, or to inform that it is impossible. Each tea bag has to be used exactly once.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, a and b (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of cups of tea Innokentiy wants to drink, the maximum number of cups of same tea he can drink in a row, the number of tea bags of green and black tea. It is guaranteed that a + b = n.

Output

If it is impossible to drink n cups of tea, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print the string of the length n, which consists of characters 'G' and 'B'. If some character equals 'G', then the corresponding cup of tea should be green. If some character equals 'B', then the corresponding cup of tea should be black.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    c = 0
    d = True
    if b > a:
        d = False
    s = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if c == k:
            d = not d
            c = 0
        if d:
            s += 'G'
            a -= 1
            c += 1
            if a < b:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        else:
            s += 'B'
            b -= 1
            c += 1
            if b < a:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        if a < 0 or b < 0:
            print('NO')
            quit()
    print(s)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `a` (the number of green tea bags) is greater than `b` (the number of black tea bags) correctly. According to the problem description, if `b > a`, it should not be possible to satisfy the condition of not drinking the same tea more than `k` times in a row. However, the program does not check this condition properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 1 2 3
```

The output should be "NO" because there are only 2 green tea bags but 3 black tea bags, and `k = 1`. The program will attempt to generate a sequence but will fail to do so correctly, as it does not account for the impossibility when `b > a`.

To fix this, the program should include a check at the beginning to ensure `b <= a`. If `b > a`, the program should immediately print "NO" and terminate.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n.
def func():
    vals = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    n = vals[0]
    k = vals[1]
    a = vals[2]
    b = vals[3]
    c = 0
    d = True
    if (b > a) :
        d = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `d` is set to `False`. There is no change in the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    s = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if c == k:
            d = not d
            c = 0
        
        if d:
            s += 'G'
            a -= 1
            c += 1
            if a < b:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        else:
            s += 'B'
            b -= 1
            c += 1
            if b < a:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        
        if a < 0 or b < 0:
            print('NO')
            quit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, and `s` is a string consisting of only 'G' and 'B' characters, where the number of 'G' characters is equal to the number of 'B' characters. If `a < 0` or `b < 0` at any point during the loop execution, the program prints 'NO' and quits.
    print(s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two integers `a` and `b` under the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n. It constructs a string `s` consisting of 'G' and 'B' characters based on the following rules: the string length is `n`, every `k`-th character is toggled between 'G' and 'B', and the toggle continues until `a` and `b` become unequal, at which point the toggle direction is reversed. The function ensures that `a` and `b` remain non-negative throughout the process. If `a` or `b` becomes negative at any point, the function prints 'NO' and terminates. If the process completes without violating the constraints, the function prints the constructed string `s`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
