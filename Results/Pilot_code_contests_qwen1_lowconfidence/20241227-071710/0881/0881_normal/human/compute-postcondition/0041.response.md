`s` is concatenated with the string `'G'`. The initial state indicates that `s` is either an empty string or 'G'/'B'. After concatenation, `s` will become 'GG' if it was initially 'G', 'G' if it was initially '', or 'GB' if it was initially 'B'. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` and `b` are updated according to the condition inside the if and else blocks, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, `s` is either 'GG', 'G', or 'GB', and `i` is 1.**
