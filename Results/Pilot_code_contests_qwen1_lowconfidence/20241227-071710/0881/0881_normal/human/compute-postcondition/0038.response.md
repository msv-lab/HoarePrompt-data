The code `d = not d` simply negates the value of `d`. Since `d` was previously either `True` or `False`, after executing this line, `d` will now be the opposite of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` and `b` are updated according to the condition inside the if and else blocks, `c` is either 0 or 1, `d` is the opposite of its original value (if originally `True` then now `False`, if originally `False` then now `True`), `s` is either an empty string or 'G'/'B', and `i` is 1.**
