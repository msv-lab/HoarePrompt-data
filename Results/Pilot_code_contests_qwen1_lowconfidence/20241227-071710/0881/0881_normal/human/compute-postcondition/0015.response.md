Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, and `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0, if `c` equals `k`. Otherwise, the same variables retain their original states from the precondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, and `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0.***
