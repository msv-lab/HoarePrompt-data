Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, and `s` is either 'GG', 'G', or 'GB'. This is because if `c == k` is true, then `d` is set to `True`; otherwise, `d` remains `False`, but since there is no other change mentioned in the else part, `d` is still considered `True` as per the if part's postcondition.***
