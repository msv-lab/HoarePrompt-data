Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals` minus 1, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, `s` is `'B'`, `i` is 0. If the current value of `b` is less than `a`, then `c` is 0 and `d` is `True`. Otherwise, the condition does not change `c` and `d`.**
