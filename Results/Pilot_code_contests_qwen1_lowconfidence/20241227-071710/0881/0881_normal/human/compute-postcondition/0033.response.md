Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` and `b` are updated according to the condition inside the if and else blocks, `c` is either 0 or 1, `d` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions, `s` is either an empty string or 'G'/'B', and `i` is 0. Specifically, if `d` is `True` (which happens in the if part), then `a = vals[2] - 1`, `c = 1`, `d = True`, and `s = 'G'` unless `a < b`, in which case `c = 0` and `d = False`. Otherwise, if `d` is `False` (which happens in the else part), then `b = vals[3] - 1`, `c = 0`, `d = True`, and `s = 'B'` unless the current `b` is less than `a`, in which case `c = 0` and `d = True`. The condition `a < 0 or b < 0` is true.**
