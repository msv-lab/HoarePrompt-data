The code sets `d` to `False`. Since `b` was previously greater than `a`, this fact remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`. `b` is greater than `a`**
