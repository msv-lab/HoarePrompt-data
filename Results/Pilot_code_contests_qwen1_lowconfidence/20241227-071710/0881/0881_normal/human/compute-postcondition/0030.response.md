`c` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `c` was previously `1`, so it changes to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals` minus 1, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, `s` is `'B'`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `b` is less than `a`**
