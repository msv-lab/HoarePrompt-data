The code initializes `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the only change is that `c` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0**
