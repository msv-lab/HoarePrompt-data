The variable `d` is currently set to `False`. The code `d = not d` will negate the current value of `d`. Since `d` is `False`, negating it will make it `True`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is equal to `k`, `d` is `True`, and `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
