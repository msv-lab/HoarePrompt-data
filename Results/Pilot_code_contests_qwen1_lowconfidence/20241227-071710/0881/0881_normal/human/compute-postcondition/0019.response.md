`c` is incremented by 1. The original value of `c` is 0, so now `c` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 1, `d` is True, and `s` is 'G', `i` is 0.
