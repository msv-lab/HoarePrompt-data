The code assigns the fourth element of the list `vals` to the variable `b`. Initially, `b` is defined such that \(0 \leq b \leq n\) and \(a + b = n\). After executing the code, the value of `b` is updated to the fourth element of `vals`.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`**
