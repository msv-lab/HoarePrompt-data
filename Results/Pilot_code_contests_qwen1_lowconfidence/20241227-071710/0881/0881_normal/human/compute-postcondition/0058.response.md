The code `d = not d` flips the boolean value of `d`. Initially, `d` is `False`. After the code executes, `d` will become `True`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `c`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`, and `s` is either 'GG', 'G', or 'GB'**
