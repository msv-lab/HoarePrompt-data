Functionality: **The function processes two integers `a` and `b` under the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n. It constructs a string `s` consisting of 'G' and 'B' characters based on the following rules: the string length is `n`, every `k`-th character is toggled between 'G' and 'B', and the toggle continues until `a` and `b` become unequal, at which point the toggle direction is reversed. The function ensures that `a` and `b` remain non-negative throughout the process. If `a` or `b` becomes negative at any point, the function prints 'NO' and terminates. If the process completes without violating the constraints, the function prints the constructed string `s`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `a == b`, the toggle starts with 'G' and alternates until the end, resulting in a balanced string of 'G' and 'B'.
- If `k` is 1, every character in `s` will be toggled, leading to a balanced string.
- If `k` is `n`, only one character will be toggled, resulting in a string with mostly one character and one toggle.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` might become negative due to the loop conditions. However, the code already includes checks to terminate early if this happens, so it is handled correctly.
