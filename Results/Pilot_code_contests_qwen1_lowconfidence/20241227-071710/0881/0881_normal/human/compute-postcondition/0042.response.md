`a` is decremented by 1. The value of `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, `s` is either 'GG', 'G', or 'GB', and `i` is 1. The changes are specific to `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, `s` is either 'GG', 'G', or 'GB', and `i` is 1.**
