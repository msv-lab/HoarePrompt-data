`s` is assigned the value of `s` plus the string `'B'`. The original value of `s` is an empty string, so the new value of `s` will be `'B'`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, `s` is `'B'`, `i` is 0.**
