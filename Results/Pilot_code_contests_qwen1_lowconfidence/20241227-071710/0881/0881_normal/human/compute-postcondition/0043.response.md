The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given the initial state where `c` is 0, after executing this line, `c` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 1`, `c` is 1, `d` is the opposite of its original value, `s` is either 'GG', 'G', or 'GB', and `i` is 1.**
