The code `d = not d` changes the value of `d` to the opposite of its original value. Given the initial state, `d` is the opposite of its original value, which means it was previously `False` (since it is said to be the opposite of its original value, and we assume it was `True` initially).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 1`, `c` is 1, `d` is `False`, `s` is either 'GG', 'G', or 'GB', and `i` is 1.**
