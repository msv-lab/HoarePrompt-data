The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. The constraints provided are for variables `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` that are supposed to be integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n. Based on these constraints, the function likely involves these variables internally.

Since no specific output is given directly from the function definition, we can infer that the function may perform some operations using these variables and then return a result. However, without the actual implementation details, we can only describe the constraints on the parameters that would be used if the function were called.

Given the constraints, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but uses integers `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` with constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n.**
