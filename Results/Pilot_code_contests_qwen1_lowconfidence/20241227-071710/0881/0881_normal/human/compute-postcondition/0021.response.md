The variable `d` is assigned the value of `not d`. Since `d` was initially `True`, `not d` evaluates to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is `vals[2] - 1` and its current value is less than `b`, which is the fourth element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 1, `d` is False, and `s` is 'G', `i` is 0**
