The code `d = not d` changes the value of `d` to its opposite. Given the initial state, `d` is the opposite of its original value. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` and `b` are updated according to the condition inside the if and else blocks, `c` is 1, `d` is the opposite of its original value, `s` is now 'GB' or 'BB', `b` is decreased by 1**
