`s` is a string that is initially empty. The code `s += 'G'` appends the character 'G' to the string `s`. Therefore, the updated value of `s` is 'G'.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `i`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is True, and `s` is 'G', `i` is 0.**
