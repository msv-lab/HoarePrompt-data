`b` is decremented by 1. The original value of `b` was the fourth element of `vals`. Since no specific value for `vals` was provided, we can only say that `b` is now one less than its original value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals` minus 1, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, `s` is `'B'`, `i` is 0.**
