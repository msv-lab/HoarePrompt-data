The code assigns the value `True` to the variable `d`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`**
