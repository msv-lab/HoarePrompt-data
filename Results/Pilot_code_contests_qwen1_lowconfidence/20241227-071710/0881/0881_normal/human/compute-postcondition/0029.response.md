The code `d = not d` changes the value of `d`. Initially, `d` is `False`. The negation of `False` is `True`. Therefore, `d` will be updated to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals` minus 1, `c` is 1, `d` is `True`, `s` is `'B'`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `b` is less than `a`**
