`c` is assigned the value 0, changing its previous value which was `vals[2] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is 0 (since `vals[2] - 1` equals 0), `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is False, and `s` is 'G', `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is False, and `s` is 'G', `i` is 0**
