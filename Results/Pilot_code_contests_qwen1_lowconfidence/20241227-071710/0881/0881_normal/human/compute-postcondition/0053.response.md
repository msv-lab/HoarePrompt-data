Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is decremented by 1, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, and `s` is either 'GG', 'G', or 'GB'. If `d` is `True`, then `b` is decreased by 1 and `c` is 0 if `b < a`; otherwise, `c` remains 1. If `d` is `False`, then `a` is decremented by 1, `d` is set to `False`, and `s` remains 'GG', 'G', or 'GB'.***
