The code `print('NO')` does not affect any of the variables. It simply prints 'NO' to the console. Since the initial conditions are that `n > 0`, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s`, and `i` are as described, these values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` and `b` are updated according to the condition inside the if and else blocks, `c` is either 0 or 1, `d` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions, `s` is either an empty string or 'G'/'B', and `i` is 0; we print 'NO'**
