The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given the initial state where `c` is 0, the new value of `c` will be 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 2`, `c` is 1, `d` is True, and `s` is either 'GGG', 'GG', or 'GBG'.**
