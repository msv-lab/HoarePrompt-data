Postcondition: ***`n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `d` is set to `False`. There is no change in the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
