The code `print('NO')` does not affect any variables but simply prints the string 'NO'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is either `a - 2` or `a - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, and `s` is one of the following strings: 'GGG', 'GG', 'GBG', 'GGB', 'GB', 'GBB'. We print 'NO'**
