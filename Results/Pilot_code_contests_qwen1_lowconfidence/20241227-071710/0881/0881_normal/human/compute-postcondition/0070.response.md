`d` is assigned the value of `not d`. Since `d` is initially `True`, `not d` evaluates to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 1`, `c` is 1, `d` is `False`, `s` is either 'GGB', 'GB', or 'GBB', `b` is decreased by 1**
