The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and splits it into a list of integers. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. The new list is assigned to the variable `vals`. Since the input is read from the user, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but `vals` now holds the input values.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n; `vals` is a list of integers read from the input**
