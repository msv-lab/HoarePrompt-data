`s` is a string that is either empty or starts with 'G' or 'B'. The code `s += 'B'` appends 'B' to the end of the string `s`. Since `s` was initially either an empty string or 'G'/'B', appending 'B' to it will result in 'GB' or 'BB'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` and `b` are updated according to the condition inside the if and else blocks, `c` is 0, `d` is the opposite of its original value, `s` is now 'GB' or 'BB', and `i` is 1.**
