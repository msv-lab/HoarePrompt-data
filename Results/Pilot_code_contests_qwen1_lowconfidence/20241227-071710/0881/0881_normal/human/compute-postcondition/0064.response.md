The code `d = not d` changes the value of `d`. Initially, `d` is `True`. The negation of `True` is `False`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `c`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 2`, `c` is 1, `d` is `False`, and `s` is either 'GGG', 'GG', or 'GBG'.**
