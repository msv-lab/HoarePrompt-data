The code assigns the third element of `vals` to the variable `a`. Initially, `n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, and `a` and `b` are integers such that \(0 \leq a, b \leq n\) and \(a + b = n\). After executing `a = vals[2]`, the value of `a` is updated to the third element of `vals`, while the values of `n`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is an integer such that \(0 \leq b \leq n\) and \(a + b = n\)**
