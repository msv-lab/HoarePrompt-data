The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after the code executes, `c` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 1`, `c` is 1, `d` is `True`, `s` is either 'GGB', 'GB', or 'GBB', `b` is decreased by 1**
