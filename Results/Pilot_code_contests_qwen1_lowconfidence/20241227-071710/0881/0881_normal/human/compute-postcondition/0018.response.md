`a` is decremented by 1. Since `a` was the third element of `vals`, its new value is `vals[2] - 1`. The value of `n`, `k`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `c` is 0, `d` is True, and `s` is 'G', `i` is 0**
