`c` is reassigned the value `0`. The previous value of `c` was equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` is now `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is the third element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals`, `d` is `True`, and `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
