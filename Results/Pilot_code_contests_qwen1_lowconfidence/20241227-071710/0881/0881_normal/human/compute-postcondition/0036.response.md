Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` and `b` are updated according to the condition inside the if and else blocks, `c` is either 0 or 1, `d` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions, `s` is either an empty string or 'G'/'B', and `i` is 0; if `a < 0 or b < 0`, we print 'NO'. Otherwise, the specific updates for `a`, `c`, `d`, and `s` depend on the condition inside the if and else blocks as specified.***
