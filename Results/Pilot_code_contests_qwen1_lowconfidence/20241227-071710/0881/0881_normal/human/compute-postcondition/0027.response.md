The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was initially 0, after executing this line, `c` will become 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `b` is the fourth element of `vals` minus 1, `c` is 1, `d` is `False`, `s` is `'B'`, `i` is 0.**
