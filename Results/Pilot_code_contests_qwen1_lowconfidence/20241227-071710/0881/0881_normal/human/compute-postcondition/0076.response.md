Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is either `a - 2` or `a - 1`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, and `s` is one of the following strings: 'GGG', 'GG', 'GBG', 'GGB', 'GB', 'GBB'. If `a < 0` or `b < 0`, the program prints 'NO' and quits. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.***
