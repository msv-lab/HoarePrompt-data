The code sets `k` to the second element of the list `vals`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was the first element of `vals`. The values of `a` and `b` also remain unchanged since they were not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `vals`, `k` is the second element of `vals`, `a` and `b` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a + b = n**
