Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is decremented by 1, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, and `s` is either 'GG', 'G', or 'GB'. Since the condition `a < 0 or b < 0` cannot be true under the given precondition (both `a` and `b` are non-negative initially), the else part applies, meaning `a` is decremented by 1, `d` remains `False`, and `s` remains 'GG', 'G', or 'GB'.***
