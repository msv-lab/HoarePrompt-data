Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or the second element of `vals`, `a` is `a - 2`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, and `s` is either 'GGG', 'GG', or 'GBG'. Since the else part has no additional conditions, the overall postcondition remains the same as the if part postcondition.***
