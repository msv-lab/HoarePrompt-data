Postcondition: ***`ans[j - 1]` is equal to `i + 2` for all `j` in the range from `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1 + c[i + 1] - 1`, and `pos[i + 2]` is increased by `c[i + 1] - 1`. If `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`, then `j` is set to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1` and `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
