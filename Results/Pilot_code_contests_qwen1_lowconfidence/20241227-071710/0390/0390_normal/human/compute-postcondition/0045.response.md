Postcondition: ***`m` remains unchanged (still greater than or equal to 1), `pos` remains unchanged, `su` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `i` becomes `1`, `pos[i + 1]` is `n + c[0]`, and `ans[j - 1]` is filled with values from `2` to `i + 1` for the appropriate indices. If `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.***
