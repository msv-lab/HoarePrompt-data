Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `n` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is `0`, `pos[i + 1]` is `n + 1`, `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` is `1`.**

Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: The initial state is provided, and the loop starts with `i` as `m`.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for each `i` from `m` down to `0`.
   - For each iteration, the value of `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`, and `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1` for `j` in the range `[pos[i], pos[i + 1])`.
3. **After All Iterations**:
   - When `i` reaches `0`, the loop stops because `i` becomes `0` and the condition `i > -1` fails.
   - At this point, `pos[i + 1]` (which is `pos[1]`) will be `n + 1` because it keeps getting incremented until it reaches `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n + 1)` is set to `1` during the last iteration when `i` is `0`.

Hence, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `0`, `pos[i + 1]` will be `n + 1`, and `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n + 1)` will be `1`.
