The code initializes two variables: `pos` and `su`. 

- `pos` is assigned an empty list `[]`.
- `su` is assigned the value `0`.

The values of the other variables (`c`, `ans`, `m`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`c` is a list returned by `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `m` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `pos` is an empty list `[]`, `su` is 0**
