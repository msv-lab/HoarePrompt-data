The code assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. The previous state was that `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is equal to `i + 1`. After executing the code, the value of `ans[j - 1]` will be `i + 1`, and the value of `ans[pos[i + 1]]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[pos[i + 1]]` is equal to `i + 1`; `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
