`pos` is a list where each element is calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[j]` for `j` from `0` to `m-1`. The code appends `0` to the list `pos`. The value of `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, and `n` and `c` remain unchanged.

After appending `0` to `pos`, the list `pos` now contains `m+1` elements. The first `m` elements are as originally defined, and the last element is `0`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m+1`, where the first `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[j]` for `j` from `0` to `m-1` and the last element is `0`; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c` list; `n` and `c` remain unchanged.**
