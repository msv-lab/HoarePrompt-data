The code `su += c[i]` updates the value of `su` by adding `c[i]` to its current value. However, the value of `i` is not defined in the given initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `su`. We know that `su` was previously `su + c[m - 2] + c[m - 2]`, and it is now updated by adding `c[i]` to this value.

The output state will include the updated value of `su` and the fact that `m`, `pos`, `n`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is now `[pos[0], n + 1 - su - c[m - 2], n + 1 - su - c[m - 2]]`; `su` is `su + c[m - 2] + c[m - 2] + c[i]`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged**
