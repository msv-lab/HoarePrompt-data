`ans[j - 1]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `i + 1` is 2. Therefore, `ans[j - 1]` is set to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is >= 1, `pos` is unchanged, `su` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `i` is 1, `pos[i + 1]` is `n + c[0]`, `c[i]` is `c[1]`, `c[1]` must be greater than 0, `ans[j - 1]` is 2**
