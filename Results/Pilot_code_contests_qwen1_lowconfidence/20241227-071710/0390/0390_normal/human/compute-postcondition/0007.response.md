Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `pos` is calculated as `n + 1 - su - 2 * c[i]`.
   - `su` is updated as `su + c[i]`.

2. **Understand the for loop:**
   - The loop runs from `i = m - 1` down to `i = 0` with a step of `-1`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since the loop starts at `i = m - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 each time, the next iteration will start with `i = (m - 1) - 1 = m - 2`.

4. **Update the state:**
   - `m` remains unchanged as long as it is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `pos` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `su` is updated by adding `c[i]` to `su`.

Given these points, let's write the new state:

- `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
- `pos` is now calculated as `n + 1 - su - 2 * c[m - 2]`.
- `su` is now `su + c[m - 2]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is `n + 1 - su - 2 * c[m - 2]`; `su` is `su + c[m - 2]`**
