`ans[j - 1]` is assigned the value `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` equals 2. Since `j` starts from `n + c[0]` and runs until `n + c[0] + c[1] - 1`, `ans[j - 1]` is specifically `ans[n + c[0] - 1]`. Therefore, `ans[n + c[0] - 1]` is set to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is >= 1, `pos` is unchanged, `su` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `i` is 1, `pos[2]` is `n + c[0]`, `c[1]` must be greater than 0, `ans[j - 1]` is 2 (specifically `ans[n + c[0] - 1]` is 2)**
