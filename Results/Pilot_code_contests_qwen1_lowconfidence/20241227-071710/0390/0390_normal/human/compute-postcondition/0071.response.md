The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` assigns the value `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. This does not affect the values of `pos[i + 1]`, `c[i]`, or `ans[j - 1]` from its previous state. Therefore, the only change is that `ans[j - 1]` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n) + 1`, `c[i]` must be at least 1, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
