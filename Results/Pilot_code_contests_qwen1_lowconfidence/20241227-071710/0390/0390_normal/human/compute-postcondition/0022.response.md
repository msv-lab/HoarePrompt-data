To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and analyze the loop condition.

### Given Information:

- **Initial State:**
  - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
  - `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`.
  - `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
  - `ans[j - 1]` is 2.
  - The current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.
  - `c[0]` is greater than 0.

- **Loop Condition:**
  ```python
  for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Evaluation:**
   - The loop runs for `j` from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must hold true at the end of each iteration.

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - The current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.
   - This means the last iteration ended within the range defined by `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

3. **Adjusting the State for Next Iteration:**
   - After the loop completes its execution, the value of `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The new range for `j` will be from `pos[i + 1]` (which is now `pos[3]`) to `pos[3] + c[2] - 1`.

### New State:

- `i` will be 2.
- `pos[3]` will be the next value in the list `pos` which is `n + 1 - su - c[1]`.
- `c[2]` will be the next value in the list `c` (if it exists).

### Adjusted State:

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged; `i` is 2; `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `ans[j - 1]` is 2; the current value of `pos[3] - pos[2]` is less than or equal to `d`; `c[1]` is greater than 0.**

Note: The exact values for `pos[3]`, `pos[2]`, and `c[1]` depend on the specific values of `n`, `c`, and `su`.
