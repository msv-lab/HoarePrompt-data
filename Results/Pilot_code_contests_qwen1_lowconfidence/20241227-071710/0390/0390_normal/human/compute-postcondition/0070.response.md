Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`
- `c[i]` must be at least 1
- `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - This means `j` starts at `pos[i + 1]` and ends at `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

2. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the range defined by `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
   - Since `j` increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` should be `pos[i + 1] + 1`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `j` will start from `pos[i + 1]` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `pos[i + 1]` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `c[i]` must still be at least 1.
   - The state `ans[j - 1]` will be updated to `i + 1` as it did in the previous iteration.

### Adjusted States:
- `pos[i + 1]` is incremented by 1.
- `c[i]` must still be at least 1.
- `ans[j - 1]` will be updated to `i + 1` for the new value of `j`.

### Final State:
State: **`pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n) + 1`, `c[i]` must be at least 1, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
