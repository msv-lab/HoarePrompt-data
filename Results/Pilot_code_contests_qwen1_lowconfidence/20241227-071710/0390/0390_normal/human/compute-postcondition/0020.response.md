To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and analyze the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
- `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.
- `c[0]` is greater than 0.
- `ans[j - 1]` is 1.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `pos` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are calculated based on `n + 1 - su - c[k]` for `k = m-1, m-2, ..., 0`.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
- `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.
- `c[0]` is greater than 0.
- `ans[j - 1]` is 1.

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `j` currently ranges from `pos[1]` (which is `0`) to `pos[1] + c[0]`.
- Since `i` is 0, the loop will iterate over the range `[0, pos[1] + c[0]]`.
- The loop will execute until `j` exceeds `pos[1] + c[0]`.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` should be within the range `[pos[1], pos[1] + c[0]]`. However, since `j` already reached the upper bound (`pos[1] + c[0]`), the loop will stop executing.

Since there is no increment or change in `i` or `pos` mentioned in the loop body, and the conditions for `j` to continue are met only up to the current bounds, we need to consider if there are any other variables or conditions that could affect the next iteration of the loop.

Given that `i` remains 0 and `pos` does not change during the loop, the only way for the loop to continue would be if `i` increments to 1 and the new value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is still less than or equal to `d`.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop condition depends on `i` and the range of `j`, and there are no changes to these values within the loop, the next iteration would require `i` to increment to 1 and ensure that `pos[2] - pos[1]` is less than or equal to `d`.

### Adjusted State:
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `pos` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are calculated based on `n + 1 - su - c[k]` for `k = m-1, m-2, ..., 0`.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
- `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
- `i` is 1.
- The current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.
- `c[0]` is greater than 0.
- `ans[j - 1]` is 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `n` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is 1, the current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, `c[0]` is greater than 0, `ans[j - 1]` is 1**.
