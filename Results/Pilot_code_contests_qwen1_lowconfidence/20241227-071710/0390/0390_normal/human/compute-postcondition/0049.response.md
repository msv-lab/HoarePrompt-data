To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop**: The given for loop is:
   ```python
   for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
   ```
   This means `j` takes values from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `ans[j - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the range defined by the for loop. Specifically:
   - The starting value of `j` is `pos[i + 1]`
   - The ending value of `j` is `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be one more than the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, if `j` was `pos[i + 1] + k` at the end of the previous iteration (where `k` is an integer), then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + k + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `pos[i + 1] <= j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

5. **Determine Next Value**:
   - If `j` was `pos[i + 1] + k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `pos[i + 1] + k + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `pos[i + 1] + k + 1` must be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

6. **Final State**:
   - Since `j` starts at `pos[i + 1]` initially and increases by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + 1` (if it was `pos[i + 1]` at the beginning).
   - Given the condition `ans[j - 1] = i + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + 1`, and `ans[pos[i + 1]]` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`ans[pos[i + 1]]` is equal to `i + 1`**
