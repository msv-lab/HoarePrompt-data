The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values or change the state of the program. All variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`m` is >= 1, `pos` is unchanged, `su` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `i` is the last index such that `c[i] > 0` (or 0 if no such index exists), `pos[i + 1]` is `n + c[0]`, `ans[j - 1]` is filled with values from `2` to `i + 1` for the appropriate indices.**
