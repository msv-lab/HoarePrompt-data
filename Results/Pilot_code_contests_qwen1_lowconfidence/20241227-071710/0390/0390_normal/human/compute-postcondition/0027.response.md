Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`; `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged; `i` is `m`; `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i] + d, n)`; if `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, then `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` is `i + 1`.**
