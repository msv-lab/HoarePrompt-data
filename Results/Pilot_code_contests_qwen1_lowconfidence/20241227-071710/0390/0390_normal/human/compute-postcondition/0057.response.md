The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` updates the value of `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `c[i]` must be greater than 0 and `j` is `pos[i + 1]`. The values of `c[i]` and `j` remain unchanged, but `ans[j - 1]` is updated to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`c[i]` is greater than 0, `j` is `pos[i + 1]`, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
