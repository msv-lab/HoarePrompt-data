`pos[i + 1]` is incremented by `c[i] - 1`. The previous value of `pos[i + 1]` was `min(pos[i] + d, n)`. After the increment, the new value of `pos[i + 1]` becomes `min(pos[i] + d, n) + c[i] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i] + d, n) + c[i] - 1`, `c[i]` is the sum of all increments applied to `c[i]` over all iterations of the loop, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range from `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1 + c[i] - 1`, and `pos[i + 2]` is increased by the sum of all increments applied to `c[i + 1]` over all iterations of the loop.**
