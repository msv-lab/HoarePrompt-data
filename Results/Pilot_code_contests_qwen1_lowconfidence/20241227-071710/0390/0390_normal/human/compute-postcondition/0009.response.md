The code snippet `su += c[i]` increments the value of `su` by `c[i]`. Given the initial state, we know that `su` was previously `su + c[m - 2]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `su` will be updated to `su + c[m - 2] + c[i]`.

The other variables (`m`, `pos`, `n`, and `c`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is now `[pos[0], n + 1 - su - c[i]]`; `su` is `su + c[m - 2] + c[i]`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged**
