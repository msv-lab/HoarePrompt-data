The code assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. This changes the value of `ans[j - 1]`, but does not affect the values of `pos[i + 1]` or `c[i]`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`, `c[i]` is a non-negative integer, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
