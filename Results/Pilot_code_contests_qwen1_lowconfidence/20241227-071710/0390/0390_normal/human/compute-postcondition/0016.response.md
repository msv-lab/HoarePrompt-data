Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `pos` is a list of length `m+1`, where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
- `n` and `c` remain unchanged.

### Loop Analysis:
The for loop iterates over the range `range(m)`, which means `i` will take values from 0 to `m-1`.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` will be incremented starting from 0 up to `m-1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < m`.
2. **List `pos`**: The length of the list `pos` is `m+1`, and its values depend on the elements in the list `c` and the variable `su`. We need to ensure that these values are correctly initialized as described.

### Required Adjustments:
- Ensure `i` starts at 0 and increments up to `m-1`.
- Ensure the list `pos` is correctly initialized as specified.

### Final State:
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `pos` is a list of length `m+1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
- `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
- `i` is initially set to 0 and will increment until `i < m`.

### Answer:
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `pos` is a list of length `m+1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `n` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is 0**
