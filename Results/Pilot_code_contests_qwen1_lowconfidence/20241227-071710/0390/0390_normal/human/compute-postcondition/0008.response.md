The code snippet appends the value of `n + 1 - su - c[i]` to the list `pos`. The value of `pos` is updated, and the previous values of `n`, `su`, and `c` are used in the calculation. However, the values of `n`, `su`, and `c` themselves are not changed.

The output state is:
Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is now `[pos[0], n + 1 - su - c[i]]`; `su` is `su + c[m - 2]`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged**
