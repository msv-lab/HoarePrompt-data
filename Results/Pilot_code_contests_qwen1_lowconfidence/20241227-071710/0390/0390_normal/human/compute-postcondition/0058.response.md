To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and the logic of the for loop.

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `c[i]` is greater than 0
  - `j` is `pos[i + 1]`
  - `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`

- For loop:
  ```python
  for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - The value of `j` is set to `pos[i + 1]`.
   - The value of `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The for loop runs from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
   - During each iteration of the loop, the value of `j` increments by 1.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - After the previous iteration, `j` is `pos[i + 1] + k` where `k` is the number of iterations already performed.
   - To enter the next iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `pos[i + 1] + (k + 1)`.
   - Therefore, the condition `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must hold true.

5. **New State:**
   - `j` should be `pos[i + 1] + (k + 1)`, which means `j` is now `pos[i + 1] + 1` if this is the first iteration of the new loop or `pos[i + 1] + k + 1` for subsequent iterations.
   - Since `c[i]` is greater than 0, the loop can continue as long as `j` does not exceed `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

### Final State:
- `c[i]` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The condition for `ans[j - 1]` remains valid since `j` is just incremented.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c[i]` is greater than 0, `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 1`, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
