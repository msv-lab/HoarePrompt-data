Let's go through this step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `pos` is a list of length `m + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1], n + 1 - su - c[m-2], ..., n + 1 - su - c[0]`.
   - `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
   - `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is `n + 1`.
   - `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` is `1`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1
   ```
   - `i` is `0`, so `pos[i + 1]` is `pos[1]`.
   - Initially, `pos[1]` is `n + 1`.
   - The line `pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1` means `pos[1]` is updated to `pos[1] + (c[0] - 1)`.
   - Since `c[0]` is part of the sum `su`, the updated value of `pos[1]` is `n + 1 + c[0] - 1 = n + c[0]`.

3. **Post-Execution State**:
   - `m` remains unchanged (greater than or equal to 1).
   - `pos` is modified such that `pos[1]` is now `n + c[0]`.
   - `su` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains `0`.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is `n + c[0]`.
   - `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` is `1`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0, the second element is `n + c[0]`, and the rest of the elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1], n + 1 - su - c[m-2], ..., n + 1 - su - c[0]`; `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged; `i` is `0`; `pos[i + 1]` is `n + c[0]; ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` is `1`.**
