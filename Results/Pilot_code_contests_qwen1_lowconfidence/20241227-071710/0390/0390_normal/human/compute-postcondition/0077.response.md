Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer, `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is `0` and the rest of the elements are determined by the loop logic, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `n` and `c` remain unchanged, `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` for all valid `i` will be set to `i + 1`, and the expression `(n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1))` is less than or equal to `d`.**
