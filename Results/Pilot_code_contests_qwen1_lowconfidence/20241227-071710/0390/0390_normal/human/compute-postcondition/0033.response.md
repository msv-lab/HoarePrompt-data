The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `m`, so `i + 1` is `m + 1`. Therefore, `ans[j - 1]` is now `m + 1`.

All other variables and their relationships remain the same. So, the updated states are:
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`
- `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`
- `n` and `c` remain unchanged
- `i` is `m`
- `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i + 1] + d, n) < m + 1`
- `pos[i + 1] >= pos[i] + d`
- `ans[j - 1]` is now `m + 1`

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`; `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged; `i` is `m`; `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i + 1] + d, n) < m + 1`; `pos[i + 1] >= pos[i] + d`; `ans[j - 1]` is `m + 1`**
