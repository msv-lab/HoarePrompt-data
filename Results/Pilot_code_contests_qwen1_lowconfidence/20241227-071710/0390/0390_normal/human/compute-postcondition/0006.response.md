`su` is incremented by `c[i]`. The value of `pos` is defined as `n + 1 - su - c[i]` from the initial state, but since `su` has now increased by `c[i]`, the new value of `pos` can be expressed in terms of the updated `su`.

Let's denote the updated `su` as `su_new = su + c[i]`. The value of `pos` remains `n + 1 - su_new - c[i]`, which simplifies to `n + 1 - (su + c[i]) - c[i]` or `n + 1 - su - 2*c[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is `n + 1 - su - 2*c[i]`; `su` is `su + c[i]`.
Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is `n + 1 - su - 2*c[i]`; `su` is `su + c[i]`**
