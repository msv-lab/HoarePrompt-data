Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where:
  - The first element is 0
  - Subsequent elements are calculated as:
    - `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`
- `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`
- `n` and `c` remain unchanged
- `i` is `m`
- `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i + 1] + d, n)`
- `pos[i + 1] >= pos[i] + d`
- `ans[j - 1]` is `m + 1`

### For Loop Statement
```
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `pos[i + 1]` is within the bounds of the list `pos` and the condition `pos[i + 1] < len(pos)` is satisfied.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is `m`
   - `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i + 1] + d, n)`
   - `pos[i + 1] >= pos[i] + d`

Given these conditions, for the loop to execute again, `pos[i + 1]` must be less than `len(pos)`, which is `m + 1`.

### Adjusting the State
- Since `i` is `m`, `i + 1` will be `m + 1`.
- Therefore, we need to ensure `pos[m + 1]` (the last element of `pos`) is updated to be less than `m + 1` for the loop to continue.

### Updated State
- `m` remains unchanged as it is a constant in this context.
- `pos` is updated such that `pos[m + 1]` is `min(pos[m + 1] + d, n)` and `pos[m + 1] < m + 1`.
- `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
- `i` is still `m`.
- `pos[i + 1]` is updated accordingly.
- `ans[j - 1]` is updated to `m + 1` after the loop.

### Final State
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `n` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is `m`, `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i + 1] + d, n) < m + 1`, `pos[i + 1] >= pos[i] + d`, `ans[j - 1]` is `m + 1`**
