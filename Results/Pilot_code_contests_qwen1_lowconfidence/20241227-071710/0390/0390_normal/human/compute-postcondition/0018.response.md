Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
1. `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`.
3. `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
4. `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
5. `i` is 0.
6. The current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - `i` is given as 0. This is already set correctly.

2. **Range Check for the Loop:**
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `pos[i + 1] <= j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must hold true.
   - At the start, `j` is initialized to `pos[i + 1]` (since `i = 0`).

3. **Initial Value of `pos[i + 1]`:**
   - From the given state, `pos[i + 1]` is the second element of the list `pos`.
   - The second element of `pos` is `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`.

4. **Condition for Execution:**
   - Since `j` starts at `pos[i + 1]`, the loop will execute if `pos[i + 1] <= pos[i + 1] < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - This simplifies to checking if `0 < c[i]`.

5. **Initial Value of `c[i]`:**
   - The first element of `c` is `c[0]`.
   - Therefore, we need to check if `c[0] > 0`.

### Required Adjustments:
To ensure the loop can execute, the initial value of `c[0]` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `n` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is 0, the current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, `c[0]` is greater than 0**.
