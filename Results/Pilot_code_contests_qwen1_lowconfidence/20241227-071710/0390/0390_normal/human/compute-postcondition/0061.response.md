The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. According to the initial state, `j` is already defined as `pos[i + 1] + k + 2`. This assignment does not affect the values of `c[i]` or `k`, and it updates the value of `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`j` is `pos[i + 1] + k + 2`, `c[i]` remains unchanged, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**
