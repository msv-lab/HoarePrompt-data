The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables `c[i]`, `j`, and `ans[j - 1]` are not changed by the `continue` statement. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`c[i]` is greater than 0, `j` is `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
