The code `print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))` does not change any variables or their values. It simply prints the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces. Since no new values are assigned to any variables, the only change is in the output printed to the console.

The initial state remains intact except for the console output which is now 'YES'. Therefore, the output state includes this print statement as part of the final state.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is `0` and the rest of the elements are determined by the loop logic, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `n` and `c` remain unchanged, `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` for all valid `i` will be set to `i + 1`, and the console prints 'YES'**
