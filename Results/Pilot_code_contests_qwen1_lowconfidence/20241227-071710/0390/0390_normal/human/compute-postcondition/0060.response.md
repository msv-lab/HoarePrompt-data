Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop variable `j` starts from `pos[i + 1] + k + 1` and increments by 1 at each iteration.
- The variable `c[i]` remains unchanged.
- After the previous iteration, `ans[j - 1] = i + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the Start of the Loop:**
   - `j` starts from `pos[i + 1] + k + 1`.
   - `c[i]` remains unchanged.
   - `ans[j - 1] = i + 1`.

2. **After One Iteration:**
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `j` now becomes `pos[i + 1] + k + 2`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was `pos[i + 1] + k + 1`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue, `j` should still be within the range.
   - Therefore, `j` should be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - Since `j` was `pos[i + 1] + k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + k + 2`.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + k + 2`.
   - `c[i]` remains unchanged.
   - `ans[j - 1]` will be updated to `i + 1` again (since `j` is incremented).

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `j` is `pos[i + 1] + k + 2`.
- `c[i]` remains unchanged.
- `ans[j - 1] = i + 1`.

### Answer:
State: **`j` is `pos[i + 1] + k + 2`, `c[i]` remains unchanged, `ans[j - 1] = i + 1`**
