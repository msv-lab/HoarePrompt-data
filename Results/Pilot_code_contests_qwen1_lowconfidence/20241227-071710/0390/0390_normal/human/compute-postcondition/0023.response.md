The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` updates the value of `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the new value of `ans[j - 1]` will be 3. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged; `i` is now 3; `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `ans[j - 1]` is now 3; the current value of `pos[3] - pos[2]` is less than or equal to `d`; `c[1]` is greater than 0.**
