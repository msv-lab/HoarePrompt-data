`pos[i + 1]` is incremented by `c[i] - 1`. The original value of `pos[i + 1]` was such that `ans[j - 1]` is equal to `i + 1` for all `j` in the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`. After executing the code, the new value of `pos[i + 1]` will be the original value plus `c[i] - 1`.

Therefore, the updated condition for the range is from the new value of `pos[i + 1]` to `new_pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`, where `new_pos[i + 1] = pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

Output State: **`ans[j - 1]` is equal to `i + 1` for all `j` in the range from `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1 + c[i] - 1`, and `pos[i + 1]` is increased by `c[i] - 1`.**
