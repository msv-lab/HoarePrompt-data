The code `c, ans = rints(), [0] * n` has the following impacts:
- `c` is assigned the value of `rints()`. Since the initial state mentions that `c` remains unchanged, it implies that `rints()` is a function that returns a list. However, without knowing the exact return value of `rints()`, we can denote it as `c`.
- `ans` is assigned the value `[0] * n`, which creates a list with `n` zeros.

Given the initial state where `n`, `m`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first three integers read from standard input, and `c` remains unchanged, the only changes occur in `c` and `ans`.

Output State: **`c` is a list returned by `rints()`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `m` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
