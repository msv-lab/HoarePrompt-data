Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m`, where each element is `n + 1 - su - c[j]` for `j` from `0` to `m-1`; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c` list; `n` and `c` remain unchanged.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Loop Execution and Variables**:
   - The loop iterates from `m-1` down to `0`.
   - For each iteration `i`, `pos` appends the value `n + 1 - su - c[i]` and `su` is incremented by `c[i]`.

2. **Final State Analysis**:
   - After the loop completes, `su` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `c` because `su` starts at `0` and is incremented by each element of `c` in each iteration.
   - `pos` will be a list of length `m` (where `m` is the number of iterations the loop executed), with each element being `n + 1 - su - c[j]` for `j` ranging from `0` to `m-1`. This is because each element is calculated in reverse order, starting from `m-1` down to `0`.

3. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `m` is less than `1`, the loop does not execute at all.
   - Therefore, `su` remains `0`, `pos` remains an empty list `[]`, and `n` and `c` remain unchanged.

By following these steps and considering the loop's behavior, we can conclude the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.
