The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the state of the variables remains unchanged after executing the `continue` statement. 

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`; `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged; `i` is `m`; `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` is `i + 1`; the current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`; all elements in `c` are greater than 0.**
