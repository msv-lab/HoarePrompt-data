The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is equal to `m`. Therefore, `i + 1` is `m + 1`. This value is assigned to `ans[j - 1]`, which means `ans[j - 1]` now holds the value `m + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `n` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is `m`, `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i] + d, n)` and `pos[i + 1] >= pos[i] + d`, `ans[j - 1]` is `m + 1`**
