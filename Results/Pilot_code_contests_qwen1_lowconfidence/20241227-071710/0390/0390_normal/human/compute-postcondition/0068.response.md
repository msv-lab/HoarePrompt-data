Let's break down the given information and the for loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`
  - `c[i]` is a non-negative integer
  - `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - `pos[i + 1]` is already computed as `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.
   - `c[i]` is a non-negative integer, meaning it can take any value from 0 to some positive integer.
   - `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` for the current `j`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` starting from `pos[i + 1]` up to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

3. **State Before the Loop**:
   - `pos[i + 1]` is known.
   - `c[i]` is known (it could be 0 or any positive integer).
   - `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` for the values of `j` in the range `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

4. **State After the Loop**:
   - To execute the loop one more time, we need to check if there is another valid `j` within the range.
   - Since `c[i]` is a non-negative integer, the loop can run as long as `c[i]` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, to continue the loop, `c[i]` must be at least 1 (since it starts from 0, it needs to be increased to 1).

5. **Updated States**:
   - `pos[i + 1]` remains the same.
   - `c[i]` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - `ans[j - 1]` will now be `i + 1` for the new range of `j`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`, `c[i]` must be at least 1, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` for the new range of `j`**.
