Output State: **`pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`, `c[i]` is the sum of all increments applied to `c[i]` over all iterations of the loop, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1` for all `j` in the range from `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1 + c[i] - 1`, and `pos[i + 2]` is increased by the sum of all increments applied to `c[i + 1]` over all iterations of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `c[i]` times, setting `ans[j - 1]` to `i + 1` for each `j` in the range from `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 2] + c[i + 1] - 1 + c[i] - 1`.
- After each iteration, `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.
- The value of `c[i]` accumulates the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `pos[i + 2]` and `c[i + 1]` are incremented by their respective values in each iteration, but since the loop only modifies `pos[i + 1]` and `ans[j - 1]`, their final values depend on the accumulated increments.

If the loop does not execute:
- `pos[i + 1]` remains as its initial value, which is `pos[i] + d` if `pos[i] + d <= n` or `n` otherwise.
- `c[i]` remains 0.
- `ans[j - 1]` remains unchanged for the specified range.
- `pos[i + 2]` and `c[i + 1]` remain their initial values.
