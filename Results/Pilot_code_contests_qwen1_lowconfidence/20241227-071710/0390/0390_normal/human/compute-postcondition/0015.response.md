`pos.reverse()` reverses the list `pos`. Initially, `pos` is a list of length `m+1`, where the first `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[j]` for `j` from `0` to `m-1`, and the last element is `0`. Reversing this list means the first element becomes the last, the second becomes the second last, and so on.

Given that `pos` originally had the first `m` elements as `n + 1 - su - c[j]` for `j` from `0` to `m-1`, after reversing, these elements will be in the order from the last to the first. So, the new order of `pos` will be:

- The first element is `0`.
- The next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m+1`, where the first element is 0 and the next `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c` list; `n` and `c` remain unchanged.**
