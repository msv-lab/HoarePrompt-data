According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `pos[i + 1]`. The loop runs from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is equal to `i + 1`
- `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
1. `j` must be within the range `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
2. Since the loop starts at `j = pos[i + 1]` and `j` increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` should be `pos[i + 1] + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` should be `pos[i + 1] + 1`.
- `ans[j - 1]` should still be `i + 1` (since `j - 1` will be `pos[i + 1]`, which was already set to `i + 1`).

State: **`ans[pos[i + 1]]` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans[pos[i + 1] + 1 - 1]` is `i + 1`**
