Output State: **`c[i]` is greater than 0, `j` is `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `c[i]` iterations, starting from `j = pos[i + 1]`.
   - After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 until it reaches `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `j` in the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1]`, the value of `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1`.
   - This means that after the loop completes, the slice of `ans` from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` (inclusive) will all be set to `i + 1`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After the loop executes, `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
   - The value of `ans[j - 1]` will be `i + 1`.
   - `c[i]` remains unchanged because the loop only increments `j` and sets the values of `ans` without altering `c[i]`.

4. **Case When the Loop Does Not Execute:**
   - If `c[i]` is 0, the loop does not execute at all. Therefore, `ans[j - 1]` remains undefined for the indices within the specified range. However, since we are focusing on the final state after the loop, the condition `c[i] > 0` ensures the loop executes.

Thus, the final output state of the loop is that `c[i]` must be greater than 0, `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`, and `ans[j - 1]` will be `i + 1`.
