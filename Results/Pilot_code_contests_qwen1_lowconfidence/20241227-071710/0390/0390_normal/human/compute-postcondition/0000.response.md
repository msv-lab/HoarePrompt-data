The given code snippet defines a lambda function named `rints`, which reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. However, this function does not execute any logic that would modify the existing variables `n`, `m`, `d`, or the list `c`. Instead, it prepares to read input data later in the program.

Therefore, the only change is that the `rints` function is now available for use, but the values of `n`, `m`, `d`, and the list `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000, and m ≤ n; the list `c` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the platforms, where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n and the sum of all c_i is less than or equal to n; the function `rints` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from standard input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer.**
