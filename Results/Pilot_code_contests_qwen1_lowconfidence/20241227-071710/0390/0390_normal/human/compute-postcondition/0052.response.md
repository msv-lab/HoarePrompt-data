The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans[j - 1]`. Based on the initial state, the following is true:

- `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is equal to `i + 1`
- `ans[pos[i + 1] + 1 - 1]` is `i + 1`

This means initially, `ans[pos[i + 1]]` and `ans[pos[i + 1]]` (which simplifies to `ans[pos[i + 1]]`) both equal `i + 1`.

After executing the code, the value of `ans[j - 1]` will be updated to `i + 1`, while the other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[pos[i + 1]]` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans[pos[i + 1]]` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans[j - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`**
