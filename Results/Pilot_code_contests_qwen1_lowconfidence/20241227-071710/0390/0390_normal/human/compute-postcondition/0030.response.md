Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `pos` is a list of length `m + 1`.
- The first element of `pos` is 0, and the subsequent elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
- `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
- `i` is `m`.
- `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.
- `pos[i + 1] >= pos[i] + d`.
- `ans[j - 1]` is `m + 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

2. **Variables Involved**:
   - `pos[i + 1]`: This value is crucial for determining the start of the loop.
   - `c[i]`: This value determines the number of iterations the loop will run.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `pos[i + 1]` must be updated based on the loop execution.
   - Since `pos[i + 1]` is updated within the loop and is used as the starting point for the next iteration, it needs to be incremented by `c[i]` and then possibly adjusted by `d` to ensure `pos[i + 1] >= pos[i] + d`.

4. **Updating `pos[i + 1]`**:
   - After each iteration, `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.
   - For the next iteration, `pos[i + 1]` will be updated to `min(pos[i + 1] + d, n)`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `m`, `n`, `c`, `su`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop (which they aren't).

### Updated States for the Next Iteration:
- `pos[i + 1]` should be updated to `min(pos[i + 1] + d, n)`.
- All other states (`m`, `n`, `c`, `su`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`, `n + 1 - su - c[m-2]`, ..., `n + 1 - su - c[0]`, `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `n` and `c` remain unchanged, `i` is `m`, `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i + 1] + d, n)`, `pos[i + 1] >= pos[i] + d`, `ans[j - 1]` is `m + 1`**
