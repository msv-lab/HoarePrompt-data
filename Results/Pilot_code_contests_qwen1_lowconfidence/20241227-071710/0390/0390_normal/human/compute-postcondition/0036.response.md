Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where:
     - The first element is 0.
     - The second element is `n + c[0]`.
     - The rest of the elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1], n + 1 - su - c[m-2], ..., n + 1 - su - c[0]`.
   - `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
   - `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is `n + c[0]`.
   - `ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` is `1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `1`.

4. **Adjusting Other States:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no other state changes are explicitly mentioned in the provided information. We assume that the values of `m`, `pos`, `su`, `n`, and `c` remain unchanged.

5. **Final State:**
   - `m` remains unchanged (still greater than or equal to 1).
   - `pos` remains unchanged.
   - `su` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `1`.
   - `pos[i + 1]` remains `n + c[0]` (since `i` is now `1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `pos` is a list of length `m + 1` where the first element is 0, the second element is `n + c[0]`, and the rest of the elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[m-1], n + 1 - su - c[m-2], ..., n + 1 - su - c[0]`; `su` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`; `n` and `c` remain unchanged; `i` is 1; `pos[i + 1]` is `n + c[0]; ans[j - 1]` for all `j` such that `pos[i] <= j < pos[i + 1]` is `1.`**
