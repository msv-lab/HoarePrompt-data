To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved and their initial values before entering the loop. Let's break down the given information and the loop statement to identify what needs to be adjusted.

### Given Information:
1. The loop updates `pos[i + 1]` based on the condition `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.
2. `ans[j - 1]` remains unchanged within the specified range.
3. `pos[i + 2]` and `c[i + 1]` also remain unchanged.
4. The loop iterates over the range `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of `pos[i + 1]`:**
   - The value of `pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.
   - This means `pos[i + 1]` could either be `pos[i] + d` (if `pos[i] + d <= n`) or `n` (if `pos[i] + d > n`).

2. **Range for the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

3. **Unchanged Variables:**
   - `ans[j - 1]` remains unchanged.
   - `pos[i + 2]` remains unchanged.
   - `c[i + 1]` remains unchanged.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`pos[i + 1]`:** It must be initialized to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`. This ensures the loop can start from the correct position.
- **`c[i]`:** It must be defined and non-negative to ensure the loop can proceed correctly.
- **`pos[i + 2]`:** While `pos[i + 2]` remains unchanged, it should be initialized to a valid starting value.

### Final State Adjustment:
To ensure the loop can execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.
- `c[i]` must be a non-negative integer.

### Final Answer:
State: **`pos[i + 1]` is set to `min(pos[i] + d, n)`, `c[i]` is a non-negative integer.**
