Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Before the Loop Starts
- `m` remains unchanged and still greater than or equal to 1.
- `pos` remains unchanged except `pos[i + 1]` is now `n`.
- `su` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains `1`.
- `pos[i + 1]` is `n`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs based on the range specified by `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - The loop variable `j` will iterate from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range specified by `pos[i + 1]` and `pos[i + 1] + c[i]` is valid.
   - Specifically, `pos[i + 1]` should be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]` for the loop to run at least once.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Given that `pos[i + 1]` is `n` and `i` is `1`, we need to check the value of `c[1]` to determine if the loop can execute.
   - If `c[1]` is greater than `0`, then `pos[i + 1]` (which is `n`) will be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[1]`, ensuring the loop executes.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop executes, `c[1]` must be greater than 0.

### Final State Adjustment
- `m` remains unchanged and still greater than or equal to 1.
- `pos` remains unchanged except `pos[i + 1]` is now `n`.
- `su` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains `1`.
- `pos[i + 1]` is `n`.
- `c[1]` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`m` remains unchanged and still greater than or equal to 1, `pos` remains unchanged except `pos[i + 1]` is now `n`, `su` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `i` remains `1`, `pos[i + 1]` is `n`, `c[1]` must be greater than 0.**
