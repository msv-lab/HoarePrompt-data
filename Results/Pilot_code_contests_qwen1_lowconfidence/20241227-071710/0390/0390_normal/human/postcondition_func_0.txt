- The function correctly handles the case where the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n` and ensures that the distance between consecutive platforms does not exceed `d`.
- However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the sum of elements in `c` is exactly `n` and the last platform placement results in the exact boundary condition (`n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) == d`). In such a scenario, the function should still print 'YES'.
- The function also does not handle cases where `c` contains zeros. If `c` contains a zero, it means there is no platform, and the function should handle this edge case appropriately by printing 'NO'.
