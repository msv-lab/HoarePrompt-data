Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the last platform does not allow reaching the target cell `n+1`. Specifically, the program calculates the positions of the platforms and attempts to place them such that they are reachable within the jump distance `d`. However, it fails to ensure that the last platform allows reaching the final cell `n+1`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
7 3 2
1 2 1
```
According to the problem description, the correct output should be:
```
YES
0 1 0 2 2 0 3
```
However, the program outputs:
```
YES
0 1 0 2 2 0 3
```
This seems correct initially. But let's consider another case:
```
8 3 2
1 3 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
YES
0 1 0 0 0 2 2 0
```
But the program might output something like:
```
YES
0 1 0 2 2 2 0 0
```
In this case, the last platform does not allow reaching the final cell `n+1` because the jump distance `d` is only 2, and the last platform starts too far from the end.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the placement of the last platform to ensure reachability to the final cell `n+1`, making it incorrect.
