You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a river of width n. The left bank of the river is cell 0 and the right bank is cell n + 1 (more formally, the river can be represented as a sequence of n + 2 cells numbered from 0 to n + 1). There are also m wooden platforms on a river, the i-th platform has length c_i (so the i-th platform takes c_i consecutive cells of the river). It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of platforms does not exceed n.

You are standing at 0 and want to reach n+1 somehow. If you are standing at the position x, you can jump to any position in the range [x + 1; x + d]. However you don't really like the water so you can jump only to such cells that belong to some wooden platform. For example, if d=1, you can jump only to the next position (if it belongs to the wooden platform). You can assume that cells 0 and n+1 belong to wooden platforms.

You want to know if it is possible to reach n+1 from 0 if you can move any platform to the left or to the right arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) as long as they do not intersect each other (but two platforms can touch each other). It also means that you cannot change the relative order of platforms.

Note that you should move platforms until you start jumping (in other words, you first move the platforms and then start jumping).

For example, if n=7, m=3, d=2 and c = [1, 2, 1], then one of the ways to reach 8 from 0 is follow:

<image> The first example: n=7.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and d (1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000, m ≤ n) — the width of the river, the number of platforms and the maximum distance of your jump, correspondingly.

The second line of the input contains m integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_m (1 ≤ c_i ≤ n, ∑_{i=1}^{m} c_i ≤ n), where c_i is the length of the i-th platform.

Output

If it is impossible to reach n+1 from 0, print NO in the first line. Otherwise, print YES in the first line and the array a of length n in the second line — the sequence of river cells (excluding cell 0 and cell n + 1).

If the cell i does not belong to any platform, a_i should be 0. Otherwise, it should be equal to the index of the platform (1-indexed, platforms are numbered from 1 to m in order of input) to which the cell i belongs.

Note that all a_i equal to 1 should form a contiguous subsegment of the array a of length c_1, all a_i equal to 2 should form a contiguous subsegment of the array a of length c_2, ..., all a_i equal to m should form a contiguous subsegment of the array a of length c_m. The leftmost position of 2 in a should be greater than the rightmost position of 1, the leftmost position of 3 in a should be greater than the rightmost position of 2, ..., the leftmost position of m in a should be greater than the rightmost position of m-1.

See example outputs for better understanding.

Note

Consider the first example: the answer is [0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]. The sequence of jumps you perform is 0 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 8.

Consider the second example: it does not matter how to place the platform because you always can jump from 0 to 11.

Consider the third example: the answer is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The sequence of jumps you perform is 0 → 5 → 6 → 11.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, m, d) = rints()
    (c, ans) = (rints(), [0] * n)
    (pos, su) = ([], 0)
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])
        su += c[i]
    pos.append(0)
    pos.reverse()
    for i in range(m):
        if pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d:
            for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
                ans[j - 1] = i + 1
            continue
        pos[i + 1] = min(pos[i] + d, n)
        for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
            ans[j - 1] = i + 1
        pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1
    if n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the last platform does not allow reaching the target cell `n+1`. Specifically, the program calculates the positions of the platforms and attempts to place them such that they are reachable within the jump distance `d`. However, it fails to ensure that the last platform allows reaching the final cell `n+1`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
7 3 2
1 2 1
```
According to the problem description, the correct output should be:
```
YES
0 1 0 2 2 0 3
```
However, the program outputs:
```
YES
0 1 0 2 2 0 3
```
This seems correct initially. But let's consider another case:
```
8 3 2
1 3 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
YES
0 1 0 0 0 2 2 0
```
But the program might output something like:
```
YES
0 1 0 2 2 2 0 0
```
In this case, the last platform does not allow reaching the final cell `n+1` because the jump distance `d` is only 2, and the last platform starts too far from the end.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the placement of the last platform to ensure reachability to the final cell `n+1`, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: - The function correctly handles the case where the sum of all elements in `c` is less than or equal to `n` and ensures that the distance between consecutive platforms does not exceed `d`.
- However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the sum of elements in `c` is exactly `n` and the last platform placement results in the exact boundary condition (`n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) == d`). In such a scenario, the function should still print 'YES'.
- The function also does not handle cases where `c` contains zeros. If `c` contains a zero, it means there is no platform, and the function should handle this edge case appropriately by printing 'NO'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
