Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the sum of the lengths of the platforms is exactly equal to `n` and the last platform placement results in the exact boundary condition (`n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) == d`). Specifically, the function checks if `n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d`, which is too strict. When the sum of the lengths of the platforms is exactly `n`, the condition should allow for the placement of the platforms such that the last platform touches the end of the river.

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where `c` contains zeros. If `c` contains a zero, it means there is no platform, and the function should handle this edge case appropriately by printing 'NO'. However, the current implementation does not check for this condition.

Here are the specific issues:
1. The condition `n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d` should be changed to `n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) >= d` to allow the exact boundary condition.
2. The code should check if `c` contains any zeros and print 'NO' if it does.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified as follows:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, m, d) = rints()
    (c, ans) = (rints(), [0] * n)
    (pos, su) = ([], 0)
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])
        su += c[i]
    pos.append(0)
    pos.reverse()
    for i in range(m):
        if pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d:
            for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
                ans[j - 1] = i + 1
            continue
        pos[i + 1] = min(pos[i] + d, n)
        for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
            ans[j - 1] = i + 1
        pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1
    
    # Check if there are any zeros in c
    if 0 in c:
        print('NO')
    elif n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) >= d:
        print('YES')
        print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
    else:
        print('NO')
```

With these modifications, the program will correctly handle the specified edge cases and meet the requirements of the problem description.
