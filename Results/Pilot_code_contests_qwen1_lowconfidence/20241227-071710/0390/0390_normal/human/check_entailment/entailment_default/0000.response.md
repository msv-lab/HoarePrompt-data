Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to handle the case where the sum of the lengths of the platforms is exactly equal to `n`, and the last platform placement results in the exact boundary condition where `n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) == d`. In such cases, the function incorrectly prints 'NO' instead of 'YES'.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

### Example
Given:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( m = 2 \)
- \( d = 2 \)
- \( c = [2, 1] \)

According to the problem description, it should be possible to place the platforms such that you can jump from 0 to \( n+1 \). One valid arrangement would be:
- Place the first platform from position 1 to 2.
- Place the second platform from position 3 to 3.

However, the current implementation checks if \( n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d \) and prints 'NO' if this condition is true. In this case, \( n + 1 - (3 + 1 - 1) = 3 - 3 = 0 \), which is not greater than \( d = 2 \). Therefore, the code incorrectly prints 'NO'.

To fix this, the code should check if \( n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) == d \) and print 'YES' in such cases.
