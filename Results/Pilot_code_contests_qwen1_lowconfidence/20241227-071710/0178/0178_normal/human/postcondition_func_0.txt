The function reads an \( n \times n \) matrix from the input, where \( n \) is an integer between 1 and 30, and each element in the matrix is an integer between 1 and 100. It then calculates the sum of each row and each column. Afterward, it counts the number of elements in the row sums (`lig`) that are less than the corresponding column sums (`col`). Finally, it prints the count. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of \( n \) (1 and 30). If the input does not follow the specified format, the function may raise an exception due to incorrect data types or out-of-range values.
