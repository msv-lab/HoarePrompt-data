Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine winning squares. Specifically, the comparison `if col[i] > lig[j]:` is incorrect. This comparison checks if the sum of the column `i` is greater than the sum of the row `j`, but according to the problem description, a square is winning if the sum of its column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of its row numbers. Therefore, the correct comparison should be `if col[i] > lig[i]:`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        T[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    lig = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
    
    col = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
    
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[i]:
                compt += 1
    
    print(compt)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly counts the number of winning squares by comparing the sum of the column to the sum of the row for each square.
