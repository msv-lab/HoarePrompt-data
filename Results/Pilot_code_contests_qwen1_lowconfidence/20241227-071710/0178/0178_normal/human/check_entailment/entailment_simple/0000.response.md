Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) which represents the size of the \( n \times n \) board.
   - It then reads \( n \) lines of \( n \) space-separated integers to populate the \( n \times n \) matrix \( T \).

2. **Calculating Row Sums:**
   - A list `lig` is initialized to store the sum of each row.
   - Nested loops iterate through each element in the matrix to calculate the sum of each row and store these sums in `lig`.

3. **Calculating Column Sums:**
   - Another list `col` is initialized to store the sum of each column.
   - Similar nested loops are used to calculate the sum of each column and store these sums in `col`.

4. **Determining Winning Squares:**
   - A counter `compt` is initialized to zero.
   - Nested loops iterate through each element in the matrix to check if the sum of the column (stored in `col`) is greater than the sum of the row (stored in `lig`).
   - If the condition is met, the counter `compt` is incremented.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `compt`, which represents the number of winning squares.

### Why it is Correct:

- The program correctly calculates the sums of each row and each column.
- It accurately compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for each element in the matrix.
- The counting mechanism ensures that only the elements meeting the criteria (column sum > row sum) are counted.

Since the program follows the exact steps described in the problem statement without any additional or missing functionalities, it is correct according to the given problem description.
