Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine winning squares. Specifically, the program incorrectly compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for each square. According to the problem description, a square is winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers. However, the program compares the sum of the column for the current square with the sum of the row for the current square, which is not the same as comparing the sum of all columns with the sum of all rows.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The correct output should be 3, as all squares are winning. However, the provided program would incorrectly count only 2 winning squares because it compares the sum of the column for each square with the sum of the row for the same square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        T[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Calculate row sums
    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in T]

    # Calculate column sums
    col_sums = [sum(T[row][col] for row in range(n)) for col in range(n)]

    # Count winning squares
    winning_count = sum(col_sums[col] > row_sums[row] for row in range(n) for col in range(n))

    print(winning_count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of all numbers in the column and the sum of all numbers in the row are calculated correctly and then compared to determine if the square is winning.
