Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code compares each row sum (`lig[j]`) with each column sum (`col[i]`), which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem requires comparing the sum of the column containing the current square with the sum of the row containing the current square, not all row sums with all column sums.

To fix this, the code should compare `col[j]` with `lig[i]` for each cell `(i, j)` on the board. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        T[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    lig = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
    
    col = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[j] += T[i][j]
    
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[j] > lig[i]:
                compt += 1
    
    print(compt)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly count the number of winning squares based on the given rules.
