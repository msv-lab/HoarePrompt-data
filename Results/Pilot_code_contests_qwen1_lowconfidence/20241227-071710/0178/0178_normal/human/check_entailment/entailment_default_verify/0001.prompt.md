You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson played some game on a checkered board n × n in size. During the game they put numbers on the board's squares by some tricky rules we don't know. However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number of winning squares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers.

<image>

For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and 24 > 19.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contain n space-separated integers. The j-th number on the i-th line represents the number on the square that belongs to the j-th column and the i-th row on the board. All number on the board are integers from 1 to 100.

Output

Print the single number — the number of the winning squares.

In the first example two upper squares are winning.

In the third example three left squares in the both middle rows are winning:

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for loop in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    lig = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
    col = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
    print(compt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine winning squares. Specifically, the program incorrectly compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for each square. According to the problem description, a square is winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers. However, the program compares the sum of the column for the current square with the sum of the row for the current square, which is not the same as comparing the sum of all columns with the sum of all rows.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The correct output should be 3, as all squares are winning. However, the provided program would incorrectly count only 2 winning squares because it compares the sum of the column for each square with the sum of the row for the same square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        T[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Calculate row sums
    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in T]

    # Calculate column sums
    col_sums = [sum(T[row][col] for row in range(n)) for col in range(n)]

    # Count winning squares
    winning_count = sum(col_sums[col] > row_sums[row] for row in range(n) for col in range(n))

    print(winning_count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of all numbers in the column and the sum of all numbers in the row are calculated correctly and then compared to determine if the square is winning.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an \( n \times n \) matrix from the input, where \( n \) is an integer between 1 and 30, and each element in the matrix is an integer between 1 and 100. It then calculates the sum of each row and each column. Afterward, it counts the number of elements in the row sums (`lig`) that are less than the corresponding column sums (`col`). Finally, it prints the count. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of \( n \) (1 and 30). If the input does not follow the specified format, the function may raise an exception due to incorrect data types or out-of-range values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
