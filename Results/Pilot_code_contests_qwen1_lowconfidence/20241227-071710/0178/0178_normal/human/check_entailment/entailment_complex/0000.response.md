Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Matrix Initialization**:
   - The program reads the integer \( n \) and initializes a 2D list \( T \) of size \( n \times n \).
   - It then populates \( T \) with integers read from the input, ensuring each row is correctly filled.

2. **Row and Column Sum Calculation**:
   - Two separate lists, `lig` and `col`, are used to store the sums of each row and each column respectively.
   - The nested loops correctly iterate through each element of the matrix \( T \) to compute the sums of rows and columns.

3. **Winning Square Counting**:
   - The program iterates through each element in the matrix \( T \) and checks if the column sum (`col[i]`) is strictly greater than the row sum (`lig[j]`).
   - If the condition is met, the counter `compt` is incremented.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the count of winning squares.

The program accurately performs the required steps as outlined in the problem description:
- Reads the size \( n \) and the matrix values.
- Computes the row and column sums.
- Counts and outputs the number of winning squares based on the given criteria.

Since the program adheres to the specified logic and handles all elements as described, the program is correct.
