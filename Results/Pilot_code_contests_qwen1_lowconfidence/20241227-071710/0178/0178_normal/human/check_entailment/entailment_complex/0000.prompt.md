You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson played some game on a checkered board n × n in size. During the game they put numbers on the board's squares by some tricky rules we don't know. However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number of winning squares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers.

<image>

For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and 24 > 19.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contain n space-separated integers. The j-th number on the i-th line represents the number on the square that belongs to the j-th column and the i-th row on the board. All number on the board are integers from 1 to 100.

Output

Print the single number — the number of the winning squares.

Note

In the first example two upper squares are winning.

In the third example three left squares in the both middle rows are winning:
    
    
    5 7 8 4  
    9 5 3 2  
    1 6 6 4  
    9 5 7 3  
    
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is provided as a string representing the first line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), followed by n lines, each containing n space-separated integers. Each integer on the board is in the range from 1 to 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[(0) for loop in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`.
    lig = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of the matrix `T`.
    col = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than their corresponding `col[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, and the loop has executed `n^2` times.
    print(compt)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an \( n \times n \) matrix from the input, where \( n \) is an integer between 1 and 30, and each element in the matrix is an integer between 1 and 100. It then calculates the sum of each row and each column. Afterward, it counts the number of elements in the row sums (`lig`) that are less than the corresponding column sums (`col`). Finally, it prints the count. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of \( n \) (1 and 30). If the input does not follow the specified format, the function may raise an exception due to incorrect data types or out-of-range values.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
