You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson played some game on a checkered board n × n in size. During the game they put numbers on the board's squares by some tricky rules we don't know. However, the game is now over and each square of the board contains exactly one number. To understand who has won, they need to count the number of winning squares. To determine if the particular square is winning you should do the following. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this column (including the given square) and separately calculate the sum of all numbers on the squares that share this row (including the given square). A square is considered winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers.

<image>

For instance, lets game was ended like is shown in the picture. Then the purple cell is winning, because the sum of its column numbers equals 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 24, sum of its row numbers equals 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19, and 24 > 19.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contain n space-separated integers. The j-th number on the i-th line represents the number on the square that belongs to the j-th column and the i-th row on the board. All number on the board are integers from 1 to 100.

Output

Print the single number — the number of the winning squares.

        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    lig = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
    col = [0 for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
    print(compt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine winning squares. Specifically, the program incorrectly compares the sum of the column with the sum of the row for each square. According to the problem description, a square is winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers. However, the program compares the sum of the column for the current square with the sum of the row for the current square, which is not the same as comparing the sum of all columns with the sum of all rows.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The correct output should be 3, as all squares are winning. However, the provided program would incorrectly count only 2 winning squares because it compares the sum of the column for each square with the sum of the row for the same square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        T[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Calculate row sums
    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in T]

    # Calculate column sums
    col_sums = [sum(T[row][col] for row in range(n)) for col in range(n)]

    # Count winning squares
    winning_count = sum(col_sums[col] > row_sums[row] for row in range(n) for col in range(n))

    print(winning_count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of all numbers in the column and the sum of all numbers in the row are calculated correctly and then compared to determine if the square is winning.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is provided as a string representing the first line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), followed by n lines, each containing n space-separated integers. Each integer on the board is in the range from 1 to 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[(0) for loop in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    for loop in range(n):
        T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`.
    lig = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            lig[i] += T[i][j]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of the matrix `T`.
    col = [(0) for loop in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            col[i] += T[j][i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
    compt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if col[i] > lig[j]:
                compt += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than their corresponding `col[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, and the loop has executed `n^2` times.
    print(compt)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
