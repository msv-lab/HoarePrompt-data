Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the comparison `if col[i] > lig[j]:` is incorrect. According to the problem description, a square is winning if the sum of its column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of its row numbers. Therefore, the correct comparison should be `if col[i] > lig[i]:`. The annotated version confirms that the program incorrectly compares the sum of the column to the sum of the row for each square, rather than comparing the sum of the column to the sum of the same row as the square. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results and thus the program does not meet the problem description.
