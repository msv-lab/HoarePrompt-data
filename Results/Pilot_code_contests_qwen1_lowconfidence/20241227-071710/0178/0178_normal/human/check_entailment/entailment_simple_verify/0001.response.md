Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine winning squares. Specifically, the program incorrectly compares the sum of the column for each square with the sum of the row for the same square instead of comparing the sum of all column numbers with the sum of all row numbers.

According to the problem description, a square is winning if the sum of the column numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the row numbers. However, the program compares `col[i] > lig[j]` for each square, which is not the intended comparison. The annotated version clearly shows that `lig` and `col` are being populated with the sums of rows and columns respectively, but the comparison in the nested loops is still incorrect.

To illustrate with the annotated version:

1. `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row.
2. `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th column.

However, when checking for winning squares, the program should compare the sum of the column of a specific square with the sum of the row of all squares, not just the current row. The correct approach would involve comparing the total sum of the column containing the square with the total sum of the row containing the square.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program needs to be fixed as per the provided corrected version to properly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
