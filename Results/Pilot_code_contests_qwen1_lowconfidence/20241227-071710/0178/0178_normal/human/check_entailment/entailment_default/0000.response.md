Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code compares the sum of column numbers with the sum of row numbers for each element, but it should compare the sum of column numbers of the current element with the sum of row numbers of the same element. 

The issue lies in the nested loops where the code sums the columns and rows. After calculating these sums, the code should compare the sum of the column containing the current element with the sum of the row containing the current element, not with the sums of all rows and columns respectively. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    T = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        T[i] = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    column_sums = [sum(row) for row in T]
    row_sums = [sum(col) for col in zip(*T)]
    
    winning_count = sum(1 for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if column_sums[i] > row_sums[j])
    
    print(winning_count)
```

This corrected code correctly sums the columns and rows and then checks each element to see if the sum of its column is greater than the sum of its row.
