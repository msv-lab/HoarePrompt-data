Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies the issue in the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the original code incorrectly compares `col[i]` with `lig[j]` instead of `lig[i]`. This discrepancy is evident from the annotation: "Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of \( n \) (1 and 30). If the input does not follow the specified format, the function may raise an exception due to incorrect data types or out-of-range values." 

The corrected version of the code, which has been provided in the explanation, properly compares `col[i]` with `lig[i]`. Since the original code does not perform this correct comparison, it fails to accurately determine the number of winning squares according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
