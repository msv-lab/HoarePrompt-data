The code updates `col[i]` by adding the value of `T[j][i]`. Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is `n-2`

So, the specific update is:
- `col[0] += T[n-2][0]`

Since `col[0]` was initially the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \), after the addition, it becomes:
- `col[0]` is now the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \) plus \( T[n-2][0] \)

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list of sums of rows; `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \) plus \( T[n-2][0] \); `i` is 0; `j` is `n-2`.**
