`col[i]` is updated by adding the value of `T[j][i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, so `col[1]` is updated by adding `T[1][1]` to its current value. The other variables are not affected.

Since `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns, and `i` and `j` are both 1, the specific change is that `col[1]` is now `col[1] + T[1][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where `col[1]` is updated to `col[1] + T[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
