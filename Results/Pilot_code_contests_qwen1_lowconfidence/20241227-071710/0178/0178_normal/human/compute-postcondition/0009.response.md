The code initializes a list `lig` with `n` elements, where each element is set to 0. This is done using a list comprehension where a loop runs `n` times, assigning 0 to each element. The variable `loop` is not used in this context and remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `T`, `loop`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0.**
