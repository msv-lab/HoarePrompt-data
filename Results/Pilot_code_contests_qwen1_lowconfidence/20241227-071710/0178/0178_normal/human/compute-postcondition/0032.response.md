The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` increments the value of `lig[i]` by `T[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T plus `T[i][1]`, `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T, `j` is 2, and `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1.

Since `j` is 2, `T[i][j]` is equivalent to `T[i][2]`. Therefore, `lig[i]` will be updated to the sum of the i-th row of matrix T plus `T[i][1]` plus `T[i][2]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T plus `T[i][1]` plus `T[i][2]`, `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T, `j` is 2, `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1**
