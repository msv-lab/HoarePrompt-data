Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list where the `i`-th element is equal to the sum of `T[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to \( n-1 \), `j` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `n` times, as `loop` is initialized to `n-1`.
- During each iteration of the loop, the value of `lig[i]` is updated by adding `T[i][j]` where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be `n`, as the loop increments `j` in each iteration and stops when `j` reaches `n`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `lig` will contain the sums of columns for each row in the matrix `T`. The final state of the variables is as described above.
