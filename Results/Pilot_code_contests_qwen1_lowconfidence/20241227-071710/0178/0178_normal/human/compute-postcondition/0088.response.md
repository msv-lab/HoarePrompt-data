Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, `j` must iterate from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), and the current value of `compt` has increased by 1 because the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` is true.**
