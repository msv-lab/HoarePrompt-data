The code snippet `lig[i] += T[i][j]` updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding the value of `T[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state and the provided conditions:

1. `n` remains a positive integer.
2. `T` remains the same \( n \times n \) 2D list.
3. `loop` remains `n-1`.
4. `lig` remains such that `lig[1]` is `lig[1] + T[1][1]` and all other elements remain 0.
5. `j` is 2 (as it was updated from the previous step).

Since the loop is iterating over `j` from 1 to `n-1`, and currently `j` is 2, the code will execute the line `lig[i] += T[i][j]`. However, the specific value of `i` is not provided, so we cannot determine which element of `lig` will be updated. But we know that `i` must be a valid index for the list `lig`.

Given that initially `lig[1]` was set to `lig[1] + T[1][1]` and all other elements were 0, the only element of `lig` that could be updated with this line is `lig[1]` (since `i` would be 1 for that specific initialization). Thus, `lig[1]` will be updated to `lig[1] + T[1][2]`.

Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `T` remains the same \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` remains `n-1`, `lig` remains the same except `lig[1]` is now `lig[1] + T[1][2]`, `j` is 2.**
