According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list where the `i`-th element is equal to `T[i][0]` and all other elements are 0, and `j` is 0.

At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be increased by 1, so `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given that `loop` is `n-1`, it implies that the loop was intended to run `n-1` times. Since `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, the loop will run until `j` reaches `n-1`. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `j` would be `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list where the `i`-th element is equal to `T[i][0]` and all other elements are 0; `j` is 1**
