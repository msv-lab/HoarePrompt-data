To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \).
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0.
- `i` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The for loop iterates over the range `range(n)`, which means it will iterate `n` times, with `j` taking values from 0 to \( n-1 \).

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `range(n)`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: Initially, `j` is set to 0 (as part of the loop initialization).

### Required Adjustments:
Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop will execute `n` times, we need to ensure that `j` remains within the valid range for the entire duration of the loop. This means that after `n` iterations, `j` should still be within the bounds of the loop.

Given that `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after `n` iterations, `j` will be `n-1`. Therefore, the state before the loop should include the condition that `j` should be able to complete the loop without exceeding the range `range(n)`.

### Final State:
The initial state includes:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements.
- `col` is a list of `n` elements.
- `i` is 0.

Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop will run `n` times, we need to ensure that `j` is properly initialized and incremented correctly. The state before the loop should reflect this:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements, `col` is a list of `n` elements, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**

This ensures that the loop can execute correctly with `j` starting at 0 and incrementing up to `n-1`.
