According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. The loop increments `j` by 1 each time it runs, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `n`.

Since there is no conditional change to `compt` within the loop (it only changes if `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`), the value of `compt` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
- `compt` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `compt` remains unchanged**
