According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \).
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented to 1. Therefore, `i` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

The state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `T` remains an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
- `loop` remains `n-1`.
- `lig` remains a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \).
- `col` remains a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
- `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \), `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `i` is 1**
