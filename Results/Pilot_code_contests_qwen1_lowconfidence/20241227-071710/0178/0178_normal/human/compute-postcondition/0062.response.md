Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop involves the variable `i`, which ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
   - `loop` is \( n-1 \).
   - `lig` is a list of sums of rows.
   - `col` is a list of sums of columns, where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
   - `compt` is 0.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `i` must satisfy the condition `0 <= i < n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` should start at 0 (the initial value for the loop).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.
   - `loop` is initially set to \( n-1 \), but this doesn't directly affect the loop's execution conditions.
   - `lig` and `col` are lists that will be populated during the loop, but their initial values don't affect whether the loop executes.
   - `compt` being 0 does not impact the loop's execution.

Based on the above analysis, the key states that need adjustment are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the modified state before the loop starts should include these adjustments.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
