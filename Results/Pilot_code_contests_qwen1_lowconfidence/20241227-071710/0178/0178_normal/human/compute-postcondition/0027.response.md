State: **`lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T, `j` is 0, `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, the initial value of `j` must be `0` because the loop starts with `j=0`.
3. The variable `i+1` must be within the range of `0` to `n-1` to ensure that `lig[i+1]` is valid and contains the sum of the corresponding row in the matrix `T`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
