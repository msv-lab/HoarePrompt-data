Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `T` remains the same \( n \times n \) 2D list.
   - `loop` remains `n-1`.
   - `lig` is updated such that `lig[1]` is `lig[1] + T[1][1]` and all other elements remain 0.
   - `j` remains 1.

2. **For Loop Analysis**:
   The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Variables and Their Evolution**:
   - `j` starts from 1 (as given).
   - The loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j = n-1`.

4. **Step-by-Step State Adjustment**:
   - At the start of the loop, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Since `j` should range from 1 to `n-1`, and we want to check if the loop can execute again, we need to ensure `j` is less than `n`.

5. **Updating the State**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `T` remains unchanged.
   - `loop` remains unchanged (`n-1`).
   - `lig` remains as it is, since no changes are specified in the problem statement for the subsequent iterations.
   - `j` is updated to 2.

Based on this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `n` remains a positive integer, `T` remains the same \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` remains `n-1`, `lig` remains the same, `j` is 2.**
