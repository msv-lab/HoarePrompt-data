According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the current iteration since `i` starts from `0`), `i` should be set to `0`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over the range of `n`.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to `0`.

The other variables (`T`, `loop`, `lig`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself but rather by the loop body, which is omitted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list where the `i`-th element is equal to the sum of `T[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to \( n-1 \), `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`**
