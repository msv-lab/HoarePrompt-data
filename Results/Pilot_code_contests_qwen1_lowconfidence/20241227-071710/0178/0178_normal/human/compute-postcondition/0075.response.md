State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]`, `j` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop starts with `j` set to 0 due to the `range(n)` function. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.
2. The variable `n` is given as a positive integer, so we don't need to adjust this state.
3. The variable `i` is given as 1, so we don't need to adjust this state either.
4. The variable `compt` is defined as the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]`, and this state does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are for the loop variable `j`, which should be set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
