According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \)
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \)
- `i` is 1

Before the loop starts, the loop counter `j` should be initialized to 0. This ensures that the condition `j < n` is met at the beginning of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must be 0

Final state after adjustment:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \), `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
