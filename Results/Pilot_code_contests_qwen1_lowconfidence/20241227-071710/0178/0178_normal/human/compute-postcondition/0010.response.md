According to the provided for loop statement and the initial states:

```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. For the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1 because the range function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `n`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a positive integer (which implies `n > 0`)
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0
- `loop` is `n-1` (which doesn't directly affect the loop condition but might be used elsewhere in the program)
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0

Since `n` is already stated as a positive integer, the only state that needs adjustment to ensure the loop can execute is confirming that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. However, since it's given as a positive integer, we can assume this condition is met.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given states.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0**
