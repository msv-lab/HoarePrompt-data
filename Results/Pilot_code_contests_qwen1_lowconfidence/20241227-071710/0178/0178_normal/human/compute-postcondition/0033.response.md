Output State: **`lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the i-th row of matrix `T`, `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix `T`, `j` is `n`, `i+1` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - In each iteration, `lig[i]` is updated by adding the element `T[i][j]` to its current value.

2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - After the loop completes, `lig[i]` will hold the sum of all elements in the i-th row of matrix `T`.
   - The value of `lig[i+1]` remains unchanged throughout the loop and still holds the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of matrix `T`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - Once the loop has completed all its iterations, `j` will be `n` because the loop increments `j` from `0` to `n-1` and then stops.
   - Since the loop condition `j < n` is checked and the loop exits when `j == n`, the loop will have executed exactly `n` times.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i+1` must be within the range `0` to `n-1`. This ensures that there are enough rows in the matrix `T` for the loop to iterate over.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `lig[i]` contains the sum of the i-th row of matrix `T`.
   - `lig[i+1]` still holds the sum of the (i+1)-th row of matrix `T`.
   - `j` is `n` because the loop has completed all its iterations.
   - `i+1` must still be within the range `0` to `n-1` for the loop to have executed correctly.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is as stated above.
