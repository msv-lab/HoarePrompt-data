According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0] + T[1][0]`
- `i` is `0`
- `j` is `1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be within the range specified by the `for` loop, which is from `0` to `n-1`.

Since `j` starts at `1` and the loop increments `j` by `1` (as it does not specify otherwise), `j` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given that `loop` is `n-1`, we can infer that the loop has already processed all elements except the last one, meaning `j` is just about to reach `n-1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `2`, and the loop condition `j < n` will still hold true unless `n` is `2`. However, since `loop` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least `3` to allow the loop to execute at least once.

Let's summarize the updated states:

- `n` remains a positive integer
- `T` remains an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` remains `n-1`
- `lig` remains a list of `n` elements
- `col` remains a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0] + T[1][0]`
- `i` remains `0`
- `j` is now `2`

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements, `col` is a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0] + T[1][0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
