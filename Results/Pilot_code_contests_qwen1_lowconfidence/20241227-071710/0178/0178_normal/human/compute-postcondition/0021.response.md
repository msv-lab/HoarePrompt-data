Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is 0
- `lig[i]` is increased by `T[i][0]`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, meaning the loop has just started or completed its first iteration.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1.

### Adjusted States:
- Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it executes, the new value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `1`.
- There is no mention of any other variables changing within the loop, so we do not need to adjust the values of `lig[i]` or `T[i][0]`.

### Final State for the Next Iteration:
State: **`j` is 1**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`j` is 1**
