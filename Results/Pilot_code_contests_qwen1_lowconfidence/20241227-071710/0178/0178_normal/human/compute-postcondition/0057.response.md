Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
   - `loop` is `n-1`.
   - `lig` is a list of sums of rows.
   - `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \) plus \( T[n-2][0] \).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n-2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(n):`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` was `n-2` at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `n-1`.

5. **Adjusting Other States:**
   - Since `j` is the only variable that changes in this loop, we don't need to adjust any other state variables based on the given information.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list of sums of rows; `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \) plus \( T[n-2][0] \); `i` is 0; `j` is `n-1`.**

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list of sums of rows; `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \) plus \( T[n-2][0] \); `i` is 0; `j` is `n-1`.**
