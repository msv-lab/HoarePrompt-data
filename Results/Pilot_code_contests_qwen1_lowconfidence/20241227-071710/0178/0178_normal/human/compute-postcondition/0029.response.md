According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T, `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T, `j` is 0, and `i+1` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.

Given that `i+1` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`, it means that the current value of `i+1` is valid, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be 1.
- `lig[i]` remains the sum of the i-th row of matrix T.
- `lig[i+1]` remains the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T.
- `i+1` remains within the range of 0 to `n-1`.

State: **`lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T, `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T, `j` is 1, `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1**
