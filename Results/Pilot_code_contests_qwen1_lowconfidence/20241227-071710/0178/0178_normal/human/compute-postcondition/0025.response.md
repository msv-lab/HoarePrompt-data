Output State: **`lig[i]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of the matrix `T`, `j` is `n`, `i` is within the range of `0` to `n-1`, `T` is an `n x n` 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements are 0.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Variable Changes**:
   - Initially, `lig[i]` starts as the sum of the first row (when `i=0`).
   - With each iteration of the loop, `lig[i]` is updated to include `T[i][j]` for the current `j`.
3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes (i.e., when `j` reaches `n-1`), `lig[i]` will hold the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of the matrix `T`.
   - The loop condition ensures that `j` goes from `0` to `n-1`, covering all columns in the `i`-th row.
   - The value of `i` remains within the range `0` to `n-1` throughout the loop, meaning the loop processes each row exactly once.
   - The initial value of `T` is such that the first `n` rows are filled with integers and all other elements are zero, ensuring that only the relevant elements are summed.

### Summary:
- `lig[i]` will contain the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of `T`.
- The loop does not affect the values of `j` and `i` beyond the loop's execution.
- `T` retains its structure, with the first `n` rows containing integers and the rest being zeros.
