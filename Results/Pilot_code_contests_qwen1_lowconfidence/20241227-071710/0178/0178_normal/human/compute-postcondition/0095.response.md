The code `compt += 1` increments the value of `compt` by 1. Since `compt` was initially defined as the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, plus 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]` was true, and `j` is `n`, the only change is in the value of `compt`. The value of `i` remains 2, and the value of `j` remains `n`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, plus 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]` was true, plus 1, and `j` is `n`**
