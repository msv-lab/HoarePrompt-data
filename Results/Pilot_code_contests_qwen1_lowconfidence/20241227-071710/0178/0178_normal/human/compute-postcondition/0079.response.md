According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus 1
- `j` is 0
- The current value of `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]` since the if condition is met and there is no else part in the code.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

Since the current value of `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]` and there is no else part in the code, this condition will still be true at the start of the next iteration as well.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus 1, `j` is 1, and the current value of `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]` since the if condition is met and there is no else part in the code.**
