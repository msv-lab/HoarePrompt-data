The code `print(compt)` prints the value of `compt`. The value of `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than their corresponding `col[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The loop has already executed `n^2` times, so the value of `compt` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, and `j`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than their corresponding `col[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, and `compt` is printed.**
