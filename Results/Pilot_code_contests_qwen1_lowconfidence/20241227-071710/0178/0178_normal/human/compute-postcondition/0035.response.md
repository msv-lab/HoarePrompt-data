The code initializes a list `col` with `n` zeros. This means that for each index `i` in the range of `n`, `col[i]` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of the matrix `T`, `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0.**
