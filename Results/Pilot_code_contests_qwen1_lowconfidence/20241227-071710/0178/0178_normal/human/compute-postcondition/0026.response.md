According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range of `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `lig[i]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the `i`-th row of the matrix `T`, `j` is `n`, and `i` is within the range of `0` to `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and still remain within the range of `0` to `n-1`.

Given that `i` was within the range of `0` to `n-1` at the end of the last iteration, let's consider the next value of `i`:

1. Since `i` is currently within the range of `0` to `n-1`, incrementing `i` by 1 would make it `i+1`.
2. For the loop to continue, `i+1` must also be within the range of `0` to `n-1`. This means `i+1` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, `i` will be `i+1` (which is now within the range if `i < n-1`), and the condition for `j` remains unchanged.

State: **`lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the `(i+1)`-th row of the matrix `T`, `j` is `n`, `i+1` is within the range of `0` to `n-1`**
