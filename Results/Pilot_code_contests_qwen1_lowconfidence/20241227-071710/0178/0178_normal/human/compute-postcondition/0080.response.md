The value of `compt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `compt` was the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus 1. Since `compt` is incremented by 1, the new value of `compt` is now one more than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus 2, `j` is 1**
