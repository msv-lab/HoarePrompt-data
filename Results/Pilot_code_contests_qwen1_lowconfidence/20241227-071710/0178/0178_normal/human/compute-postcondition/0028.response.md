The initial state is:
- `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T
- `j` is 0
- `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1

The code snippet updates `lig[i]` by adding the element `T[i][j]` to it. Given that `j` is 0, this means `lig[i]` is updated to be the sum of the i-th row of matrix T.

After the code executes, the value of `lig[i+1]` remains unchanged because it was not directly modified by the code. However, `lig[i]` is now updated to the sum of the i-th row of matrix T.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T
- `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T
- `j` is 0
- `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1

Output State: **`lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T, `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T, `j` is 0, `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1**
