The code updates `col[i]` by adding `T[j][i]`. Given the initial values, `i` is 0 and `j` is `n-1`. So, `col[0]` is updated by adding `T[n-1][0]`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
   - `loop` is `n-1`
   - `lig` is a list of sums of rows
   - `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \) plus \( T[n-2][0] \)
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is `n-1`

2. After executing the line `col[i] += T[j][i]`:
   - `i` remains 0
   - `j` remains `n-1`
   - `col[0]` is updated to `col[0] + T[n-1][0]`

So, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of sums of rows
- `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \) plus \( T[n-2][0] \) plus `T[n-1][0]`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is `n-1`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list of sums of rows; `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( 2 \cdot T[n-1][0] \) plus \( T[n-2][0]`; `i` is 0; `j` is `n-1`.**
