The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, which consists of a string representing the first line containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` space-separated integers. Each integer on the board is in the range from 1 to 100. Based on this input, the function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

Given the structure of the problem, we can infer that the function processes this input but does not provide an explicit return value as described. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read a specific structured input and process it accordingly.

Functionality: **The function reads a string representing the first line containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 30), followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` space-separated integers. It processes this input but does not return any explicit value.**
