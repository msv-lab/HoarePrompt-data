The code snippet updates `lig[i]` by adding `T[i][j]` to it. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input, and all other elements in \( T \) are 0.
   - `loop` is `n-1`.
   - `lig` is a list where the `i`-th element is equal to `T[i][0]` and all other elements are 0.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The code modifies `lig[i]` by adding `T[i][j]` to it. Since `i` and `j` are specified, we need to know their exact values to determine the impact.
   - Given that `i` and `j` are both 1, this line of code specifically updates `lig[1]` to `lig[1] + T[1][1]`.

3. **Updating Variables:**
   - `lig[1]` is updated to `lig[1] + T[1][1]`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Output State:**
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `T` remains the same \( n \times n \) 2D list.
   - `loop` remains `n-1`.
   - `lig` is now updated such that `lig[1]` is `lig[1] + T[1][1]` and all other elements remain 0.
   - `j` remains 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list where the `1`-th element is `lig[1] + T[1][1]` and all other elements are 0; `j` is 1.**
