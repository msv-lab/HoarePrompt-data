Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, and `j` is `n`**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, if `col[i] > lig[j]`, the value of `compt` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates `n` times, and `j` starts from `0` and increments until it reaches `n-1` and then exits the loop.
- The value of `i` remains `2` because it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `n` remains the same as the initial value because it is not modified within the loop.
- `compt` is the cumulative count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution.
