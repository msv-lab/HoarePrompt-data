Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, plus 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]` was true, and `j` is `n`. If `col[i] > lig[j]` is true, `compt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `compt` remains unchanged.***
