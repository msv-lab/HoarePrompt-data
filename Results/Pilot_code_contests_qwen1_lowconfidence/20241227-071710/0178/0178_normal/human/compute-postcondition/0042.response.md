`col[i]` is updated to `col[0] + T[0][0] + T[1][0] + T[j][i]`, where `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Therefore, `col[0]` becomes `col[0] + T[0][0] + T[1][0] + T[2][0]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements, `col` is a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0] + T[1][0] + T[2][0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
