According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list of sums of rows.
- `col` is a list of sums of columns, where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `n`, the loop cannot execute again directly because the condition `i < n` fails.

However, if we assume that the loop body updates the values and potentially changes `i` or other variables, we need to consider the updated states.

Given the current state:
- `i` is `n`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented or reset within the loop body to a value less than `n`.

Since no specific loop body is provided, we'll assume typical operations might include incrementing `i` or resetting it. To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be set to 0 or any value less than `n`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is set to 0 (or any value less than `n`), while keeping the other variables as they are.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \)**
