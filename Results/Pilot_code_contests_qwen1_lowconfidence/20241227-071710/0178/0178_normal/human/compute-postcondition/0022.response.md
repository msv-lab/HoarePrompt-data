The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` increments the value of `lig[i]` by `T[i][j]`. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `lig`, `T`, or `i`. Therefore, the exact updated value of `lig[i]` cannot be determined. The only thing that is certain is that `lig[i]` has been updated by adding `T[i][j]` to its current value.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `lig[i]` is updated to the value of `lig[i] + T[i][j]`**
