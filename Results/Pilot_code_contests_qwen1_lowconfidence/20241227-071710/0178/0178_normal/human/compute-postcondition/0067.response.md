Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop is iterating over `j` starting from 0 up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have reached `n-1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`.
   - However, since `j` has already reached `n-1`, the condition `j < n` will fail, and the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - There is no change in `i` because the loop is not dependent on `i` for its continuation.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - Since the loop is about to terminate, we do not need to adjust `compt` or any other variables related to the loop body.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0**

The values of `i` and `n` do not change, and since the loop is about to terminate, there is no need to adjust any other variables.
