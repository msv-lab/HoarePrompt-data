Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
   - `loop` is `n-1`.
   - `lig` is a list of sums of rows.
   - `col` is a list of sums of columns, where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
   - `j` must be initialized to `n-1` and decrement to 0 during the loop execution.

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   col[i] += T[j][i]
   ```
   - The value of `i` is 0.
   - The value of `j` is `n-1`.
   - `col[0]` is updated by adding the value of `T[n-1][0]`.

Since `j` starts at `n-1` and is decremented to 0, the first execution of this line updates `col[0]` with the value of `T[n-1][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list of sums of rows; `col` is a list of sums of columns, where each element `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \); `i` is 0; `j` is `n-1` and is about to decrement to 0; `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \).**
