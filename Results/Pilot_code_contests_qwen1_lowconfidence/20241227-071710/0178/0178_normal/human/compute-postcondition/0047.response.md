Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \)
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \)
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 0
- `col[1]` is the original value of `col[1]` plus `T[0][1]`

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable `j` is iterating from `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `0`.

### Next Iteration:
- Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, the next value of `j` will be `1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `T`, `loop`, `lig`, `col`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

### Updated States:
- `n` remains the same
- `T` remains the same
- `loop` remains `n-1`
- `lig` remains the same
- `col` remains the same (since no operations modifying `col` are mentioned)
- `i` remains `1`
- `j` changes to `1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \), `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
