Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list of sums of rows.
- `col` is a list of sums of columns, where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `n-1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(n):
    col[i] += T[j][i]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the value of `T[j][i]` (where `i` is fixed at 0) is added to `col[i]`.

2. **Effect of the Loop:**
   - Since `i` is fixed at 0, the loop is essentially adding the elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) to `col[0]`.
   - The loop runs `n` times (from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`).

3. **Final Value of `col[0]`:**
   - After the loop completes, `col[0]` will be the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \).

4. **Values of Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `T` remains unchanged.
   - `loop` is initially `n-1` and is not modified within the loop.
   - `lig` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains 0 after the loop completes.
   - `j` is set to `n-1` initially and decreases with each iteration until it becomes 0.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute exactly `n` times because `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

### Output State after All Iterations:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
- `loop` is `n-1` (unchanged).
- `lig` is a list of sums of rows (unchanged).
- `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) (after the loop).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).
- `j` is 0 (after the loop completes).

### Final Output State:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list of sums of rows; `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \); `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**
