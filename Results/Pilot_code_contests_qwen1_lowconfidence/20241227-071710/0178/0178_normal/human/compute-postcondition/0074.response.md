According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer
- `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is now 1
- `n` remains a positive integer (unchanged)
- `compt` remains the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` (unchanged)

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]`**
