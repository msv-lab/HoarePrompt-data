`compt` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `compt` is its previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, plus 1, `j` must iterate from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).
