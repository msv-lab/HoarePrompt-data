According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The initial state of `i` being 0 is correct for the loop to start, but since we are focusing on ensuring the loop can execute, we only need to confirm that `n` meets the required condition.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
