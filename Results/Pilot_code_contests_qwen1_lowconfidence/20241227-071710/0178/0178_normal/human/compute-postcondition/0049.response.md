Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list of sums of rows.
- `col` is a list of sums of columns, where `col[1]` is updated to `col[1] + T[1][1]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1.

### For Loop Statement
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
2. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2 (since `range(n)` includes values from 0 to `n-1`).

### Adjusted States
- `j` will be incremented to 2.
- All other states (`n`, `T`, `loop`, `lig`, `col`, `i`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on these variables within the loop.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `T` remains an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
- `loop` remains `n-1`.
- `lig` remains a list of sums of rows.
- `col` remains a list of sums of columns, where `col[1]` is updated to `col[1] + T[1][1]`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` is now 2.

### Answer
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where `col[1]` is updated to `col[1] + T[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
