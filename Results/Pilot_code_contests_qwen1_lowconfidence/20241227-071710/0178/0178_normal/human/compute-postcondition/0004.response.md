Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where \( T[0] = [1, 2, 3] \) and all other elements in \( T \) are 0.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   ```python
   for loop in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop runs from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - Each iteration of the loop will increment the variable `loop`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `loop` would be \( n-1 \) because the loop runs from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `loop` should be 0 (the first iteration).

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop has completed its iterations up to \( n-1 \), the variable `loop` needs to be reset to 0 for the next iteration.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it determines the total number of iterations.
   - The state of the 2D list \( T \) does not change unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to \( T \).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` remains the same.
- `loop` is reset to 0.
- The state of the 2D list \( T \) remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list with \( T[0] = [1, 2, 3] \) and all other elements in \( T \) are 0; `loop` is 0**
