The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` updates the value of `col[i]` by adding `T[j][i]` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0]`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. The variable `i` is initially 0, so `col[0]` is being updated.
2. The variable `j` is initially 1, so `T[j][i]` refers to `T[1][0]`.

Given the initial state, `col[0]` is already set to `col[0] + T[0][0]`. Now, `col[0]` will be updated by adding `T[1][0]` to it. So, `col[0]` will be `col[0] + T[0][0] + T[1][0]`.

The output state will be:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements (unchanged)
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0] + T[1][0]`
- `i` is 0 (unchanged)
- `j` is 1 (unchanged)

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements, `col` is a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0] + T[1][0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
