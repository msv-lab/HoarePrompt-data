According to the code, the loop will iterate over the variable `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute, the variable `j` must take on values from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.

Let's break down the required adjustments:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, and `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).

2. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop will run as long as `j` is within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - Since `j` starts at `n-1` and the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`, `j` must decrement or change in such a way that it iterates through all values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `j` needs to start at `n-1` but should decrement to 0 for the loop to execute fully.
   - We need to ensure that `j` is set to `n-1` initially, and during the loop, it will decrement to 0.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` starts at `n-1` and will iterate down to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `j` must be initialized to `n-1` and decrement to 0 during the loop execution.**
