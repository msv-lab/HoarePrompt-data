Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
1. `n` is a positive integer.
2. `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0.
3. `loop` is `n-1`.
4. `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0.

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Given the above, the key variable here is `j`. The loop will start with `j = 0` and increment `j` until `j` reaches `n-1`.

### Required Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that the loop can start and run correctly. This means `j` should be initialized to `0` and will increase through the values from `0` to `n-1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` should be set to `0` at the start of the loop.
- Since the loop will iterate `n` times (from `0` to `n-1`), we need to ensure `j` increments properly within the loop body, but this is not something we need to explicitly adjust in the initial state.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, `j` is 0**
