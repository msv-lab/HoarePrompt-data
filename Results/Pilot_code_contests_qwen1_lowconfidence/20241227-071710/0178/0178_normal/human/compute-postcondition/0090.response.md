Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, plus 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]` was true, and `j` must iterate from 0 to n-1 (inclusive).***
