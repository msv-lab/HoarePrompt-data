Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list where the `i`-th element is equal to the sum of `T[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `0`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the start, `j` is `n`. For the loop to start, `j` must be within the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to `0`.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is not used directly in the loop, but its value (`0`) is consistent with the initialization for the first iteration.
   - No adjustment is needed for `i`.

3. **2D List `T`:**
   - `T` is already initialized as an \( n \times n \) list with the first `n` rows containing integers and the rest being zeros.
   - No adjustment is needed for `T`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `loop` is `n-1` and is not used in the loop itself.
   - `lig` is not directly affected by the loop and its values are consistent with the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to `0`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is 0**
