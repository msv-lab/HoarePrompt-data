According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements, `col` is a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0]`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1.

Since the loop condition only depends on `j`, no other states need to be adjusted. The values of `n`, `T`, `loop`, `lig`, `col`, `i`, and `j` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration, except for `j` which will be incremented.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements, `col` is a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
