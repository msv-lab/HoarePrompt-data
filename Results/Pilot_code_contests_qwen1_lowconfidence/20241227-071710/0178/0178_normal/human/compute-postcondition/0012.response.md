The code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` increments the value of `lig[i]` by `T[i][j]`. Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0
- `j` is 0

Since `j` is 0, the code `lig[i] += T[i][j]` effectively means `lig[i] += T[i][0]`. Initially, all elements of `lig` are 0. Thus, the value of `lig[i]` will become the value of `T[i][0]`.

The output state will be:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` remains unchanged (the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0)
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` will have its `i`-th element updated to the value of `T[i][0]`, and all other elements remain 0
- `j` is 0

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list where the `i`-th element is equal to `T[i][0]` and all other elements are 0; `j` is 0**
