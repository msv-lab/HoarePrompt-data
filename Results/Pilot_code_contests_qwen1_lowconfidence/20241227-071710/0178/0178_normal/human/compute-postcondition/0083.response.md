`compt` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, and the expression for `compt` remains the same but is updated to `compt + 1`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, and `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus 3.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, and `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus 3.**
