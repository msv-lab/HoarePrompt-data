According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n-1` and is about to decrement to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range specified by the `range(n)` function.

Given that `j` starts at 0 and increments, the loop will execute as long as `j < n`. Since `j` is currently `n-1`, the next value of `j` would be `n-2`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is now `n-2`.

Let's summarize the updated state:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list of sums of rows.
- `col` is a list of sums of columns, where each element `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \).
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is now `n-2` (decremented from `n-1`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list; `loop` is `n-1`; `lig` is a list of sums of rows; `col` is a list of sums of columns, where each element `col[0]` is the sum of all elements in the 0-th column of the matrix \( T \) plus \( T[n-1][0] \); `i` is 0; `j` is `n-2`.**
