The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` updates the value of `col[i]` by adding `T[j][i]` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements
- `col` is a list of `n` elements
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0

Initially, `col[0]` (since `i` is 0) is added to `T[0][0]` (since `j` is 0). The value of `col[0]` after this operation is `col[0] + T[0][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements, `col` is a list of `n` elements where `col[0]` is `col[0] + T[0][0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
