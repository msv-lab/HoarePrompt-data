`compt` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. After executing `compt += 1`, the value of `compt` is 1, while `i` remains 0 and `n` is still greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `compt` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `compt` is 1**
