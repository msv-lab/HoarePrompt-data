`compt` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 0, and the current value of `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`. The precondition that `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]`**
