The code `T[loop] = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to `T[loop]`. Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list with \( T[0] \) updated to a list of integers read from input, and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, and `loop` is 1.

Since `loop` is 1, `T[1]` will be updated to the list of integers read from input. All other elements in the list `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list with \( T[0] \) and \( T[1] \) updated to lists of integers read from input, and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is 1**
