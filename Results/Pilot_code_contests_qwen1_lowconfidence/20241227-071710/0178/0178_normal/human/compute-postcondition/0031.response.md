According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `j`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
- `lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T plus `T[i][1]`
- `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T
- `j` is 1
- `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `j = 2`. Since `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1, this condition remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T plus `T[i][1]`, `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T, `j` is 2, `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1**
