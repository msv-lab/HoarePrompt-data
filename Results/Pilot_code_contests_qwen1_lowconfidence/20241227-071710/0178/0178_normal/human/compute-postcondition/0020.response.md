The code snippet `lig[i] += T[i][j]` increments the value of `lig[i]` by `T[i][j]`. However, the initial state does not define the values of `lig`, `i`, or `T`. Given that `j` is 0, the code effectively tries to access `T[i][0]` and add its value to `lig[i]`.

Since no specific values are provided for `lig`, `i`, or `T`, we cannot determine the exact numerical changes. We can only state that `lig[i]` has been updated.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `lig[i]` is increased by `T[i][0]`**
