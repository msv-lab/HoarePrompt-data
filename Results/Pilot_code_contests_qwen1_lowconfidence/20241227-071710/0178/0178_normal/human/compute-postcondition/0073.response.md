Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop runs for each element in `range(n)`, meaning it iterates `n` times.
- During each iteration, the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` is checked, and if true, `compt` is incremented by 1.
- Since `i` is fixed at 0 throughout the loop (as it is not modified within the loop), the comparison is always between `col[0]` and each element in `lig`.
- After the loop completes, `compt` will hold the total count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0):
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` is 0.
- `compt` remains 0, as no comparisons are made.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
