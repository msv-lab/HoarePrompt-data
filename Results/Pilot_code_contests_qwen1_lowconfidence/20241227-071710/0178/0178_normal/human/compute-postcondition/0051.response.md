Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \)**

### Explanation:
- **`n` is a positive integer**: This remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
- **`T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list**: This also remains unchanged.
- **`loop` is `n-1`**: This remains unchanged as well.
- **`lig` is a list of sums of rows**: This remains unchanged as the loop only affects the `col` list.
- **`col` is a list of sums of columns where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \)**: After the loop completes, each element `col[i]` will be the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
- **`i` is `n`**: The loop runs for `n-1` iterations, so `i` will be incremented to `n` after the last iteration.
- **`j` is `n-1`**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`, so `j` will be `n-1` after the last iteration.
- **`col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \)**: Since the loop correctly accumulates the sum of each column into the `col` list, after the loop completes, `col[i]` will hold the sum of the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 1), then:
- `i` will be 1, and `j` will be 0.
- `col[1]` will be the value of `T[0][1]` (if `n` is 1, there is only one column, so `col[1]` will be the sum of that single column).

However, since the problem specifies that the loop executes at least once, we focus on the general case where the loop completes its iterations.
