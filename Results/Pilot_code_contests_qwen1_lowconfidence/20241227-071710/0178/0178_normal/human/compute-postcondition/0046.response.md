The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` updates the value of `col[i]` by adding `T[j][i]` to its current value. Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \)
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \)
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 0

The code snippet `col[i] += T[j][i]` implies:
- `col[1]` is updated by adding `T[0][1]` to its current value.

Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, the code specifically updates `col[1]` by adding the value at `T[0][1]` to `col[1]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `col[1]` is updated to its original value plus `T[0][1]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \), `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `col[1]` is the original value of `col[1]` plus `T[0][1]`**
