The code `col[i] += T[j][i]` updates the value of `col[i]` by adding `T[j][i]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list
- `loop` is `n-1`
- `lig` is a list of sums of rows
- `col` is a list of sums of columns where `col[1]` is updated to `col[1] + T[1][1]`
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2

We know that initially, `col[1]` was updated to `col[1] + T[1][1]`. Now, the code updates `col[i]` (which is `col[1]`) by adding `T[j][i]` (which is `T[2][1]`).

So, the new value of `col[1]` will be the previous value of `col[1]` plus `T[2][1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where `col[1]` is now `col[1] + T[2][1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
