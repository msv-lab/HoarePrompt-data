Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \).
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(n):
    col[i] += T[j][i]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations (from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`).
   - For each iteration, `col[i]` is updated by adding the value of `T[j][i]`.

2. **Final State of `col`**:
   - After the loop completes, `col[i]` will be the sum of all elements in the `i`-th column of the matrix \( T \).

### Final Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0.
- `loop` is `n-1`.
- `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \).
- `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \).
- `i` is 0.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \), `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \), `i` is 0.**
