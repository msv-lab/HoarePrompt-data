The code `compt += 1` increments the value of `compt` by 1. The initial value of `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, plus 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]` was true. The initial values of `i` and `n` are 2 and `n` respectively. The variable `j` is equal to `n`.

After executing the code, `compt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, plus 1 if `col[i] > lig[j]` was true, plus 1, and `j` is `n`**
