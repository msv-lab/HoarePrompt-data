The code updates the value of `lig[i]` by adding the element `T[i][j]` to it. Given the initial state, `lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T, `lig[i+1]` is the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T, `j` is 1, and `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1.

After executing the code:
- `lig[i]` is updated to `lig[i] + T[i][j]`.
- Since `j` is 1, the value added to `lig[i]` is `T[i][1]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `lig[i]` is now `lig[i] + T[i][1]`.
- `lig[i+1]` remains unchanged as it is the sum of the (i+1)-th row, which is not affected by the update to `lig[i]`.
- `j` remains 1.
- `i+1` remains within the range of 0 to n-1.

Output State: **`lig[i]` is the sum of the i-th row of matrix T plus `T[i][1]`, `lig[i+1]` is equal to the sum of all elements in the (i+1)-th row of the matrix T, `j` is 1, `i+1` is within the range of 0 to n-1**
