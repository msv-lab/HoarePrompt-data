State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`, `lig` is a list of `n` elements where each element `lig[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th row of the matrix \( T \), `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The `for i in range(n)` loop iterates over values of `i` from 0 to \( n-1 \). For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within this range.

2. **Variable `n`**: Since the loop depends on `n`, it must be a positive integer to ensure there are valid iterations. This condition is already met as stated.

3. **Variable `T`**: The 2D list `T` is initialized such that the first `n` rows contain integers read from input, and the rest of the elements are 0. No adjustment is needed here since it's already defined.

4. **Variable `loop`**: The value of `loop` is given as `n-1`, which is correct and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.

5. **Variable `lig`**: The list `lig` contains sums of each row in `T`. Each element `lig[i]` is the sum of the elements in the \( i \)-th row of `T`. No adjustment is needed here since it's correctly defined.

6. **Variable `col`**: The list `col` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0. No adjustment is needed here since it's already defined.

7. **Initial Value of `i`**: To start the loop, `i` must be set to 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the initial value of `i` to be 0.

Thus, the required adjustments are ensuring that `i` is 0 when the loop starts.
