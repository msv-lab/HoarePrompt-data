Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list where the first `n` rows are lists of integers read from input and all other elements in \( T \) are 0, `loop` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times.
- Each iteration updates the `loop`-th row of the 2D list `T` with a list of integers read from the input.
- After all iterations, the first `n` rows of `T` will be filled with the corresponding lists of integers, and the remaining rows (if any) will still be `[0]`.

Since the loop runs exactly `n` times, `loop` will be `n-1` when the loop exits.
