The variable `compt` is initialized to 0. This means that `compt` now holds the value 0, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is \( n-1 \), `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns where each element `col[i]` is the sum of all elements in the \( i \)-th column of the matrix \( T \); `compt` is 0.**
