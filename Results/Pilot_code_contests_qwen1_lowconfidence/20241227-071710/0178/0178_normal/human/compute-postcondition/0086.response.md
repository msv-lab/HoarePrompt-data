According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution
- `j` is `n-1`
- The loop has executed `n` times

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `2`. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `2`. Since the loop has already executed `n` times, `i` cannot be less than `n`, so `n` remains the same.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus the number of times the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` was true during the loop execution, `j` is `n-1`, and the loop has executed `n` times**
