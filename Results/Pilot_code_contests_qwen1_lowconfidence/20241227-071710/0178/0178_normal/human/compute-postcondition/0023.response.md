Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `lig[i]` is updated to the value of `lig[i] + T[i][j]`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

4. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `lig[i]` remains unchanged as the update only happens within the loop and doesn't depend on the value of `j` outside the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`j` is 2, `lig[i]` is updated to the value of `lig[i] + T[i][j]`**
