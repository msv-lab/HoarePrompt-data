Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than their corresponding `col[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `j` is `n-1`, and the loop has executed `n^2` times.**

Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `n` is a positive integer, `T` is an \( n \times n \) 2D list, `loop` is \( n-1 \), `lig` is a list of sums of rows, `col` is a list of sums of columns, and `compt` is 0.
2. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop runs `n` times (from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`), and the inner loop runs `n` times (from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`).
3. **Condition Check**: For each iteration, the condition `col[i] > lig[j]` is checked, and if true, `compt` is incremented.

After the loop completes:
- The outer loop runs `n` times, and the inner loop also runs `n` times, so in total, the loop runs \( n \times n = n^2 \) times.
- The variable `i` will take the final value of `n - 1`, and since the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` will be `n` at the end of the last iteration.
- The variable `j` will also take the final value of `n - 1` because the inner loop increments `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
- The variable `compt` will hold the count of elements in `lig` that are less than their corresponding `col[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

In the case where the loop does not execute (which is not possible given the problem constraints as `n` is a positive integer and the loops run `n^2` times), the values would remain as per the initial state with `compt` still being 0. However, based on the problem setup, the loop will always execute, and the described state will be accurate.
