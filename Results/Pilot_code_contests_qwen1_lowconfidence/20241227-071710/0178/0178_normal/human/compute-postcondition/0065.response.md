`compt` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]` still holds true. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]; compt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `col[i]` is greater than `lig[j]; compt` is incremented by 1**
