According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus 2, and `j` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop.

The state of `i` and `compt` does not change within the loop, so they remain the same.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `compt` is the count of elements in `lig` that are less than `col[0]` plus 2, `j` is 2**
