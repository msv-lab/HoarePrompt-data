The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of subsequent lines of input. The input is expected to be a string that can be converted to an integer within the range [1, 30]. After executing this line, the variable `n` will hold the integer value of the input, while the content of the input itself remains unchanged.

Output State: **the input is provided as a string, `n` is the integer value of the input representing the number of subsequent lines of input, each containing n space-separated integers.**
