None of the variables in the function `func_3()` are mentioned in the problem description or the function signature. The function does not take any parameters and returns a map object that maps input integers from user input. However, based on the context, it seems the function is expected to receive an integer `n` as input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
