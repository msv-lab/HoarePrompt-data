The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. It returns `False` for values of `n` that do not meet specific criteria and `True` for the value `n = 7`. Specifically:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 8, the function returns `False`.
- If `n` is 7, the function returns `True`.
- For other values of `n` between 1 and 100 (excluding 7), the function returns `False`.

The function checks if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, and then uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If `n` passes all these checks, it returns `True`, which only happens when `n` is 7.
