The function `func_2` reads an integer input from the user and returns it as the order of the rhombus (n). It does not accept any parameters. The function assumes that the user will provide a valid integer input. If the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. No error handling is included to manage such cases.
