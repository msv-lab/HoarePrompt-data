The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by calling another function `func_3()`, which is presumed to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Since the actual implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, the exact nature of the list returned by `func_4()` cannot be determined precisely. However, it is clear that the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns this list. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `func_3()` might return an empty list or a list with specific properties (e.g., length, contents). If `func_3()` does not handle certain inputs correctly, those cases would also be relevant edge cases.
