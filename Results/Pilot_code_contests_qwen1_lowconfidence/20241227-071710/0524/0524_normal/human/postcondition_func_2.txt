The function `func_3()` takes no explicit parameters but expects an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) to be provided as input through standard input. It reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual string elements based on spaces, converts each string element to an integer, and returns a map object that contains these integers as key-value pairs. If the input does not conform to the specified range or format, the function will still attempt to convert the input to integers and create a map, potentially resulting in a map with fewer entries than the number of space-separated values provided, depending on the input validity.
