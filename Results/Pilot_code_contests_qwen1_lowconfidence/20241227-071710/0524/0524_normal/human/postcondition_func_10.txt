The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 100 and returns a list of its digits. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the function converts `n` into a string, iterates over each character in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. This list is then returned. Since `n` is guaranteed to be within the specified range, no special handling for edge cases such as leading zeros or negative numbers is necessary. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program has a list of integers representing the digits of `n`.
