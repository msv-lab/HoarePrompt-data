The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list containing `n` sublists, each of which contains `m` elements, all set to `num`. There are no constraints on `n` and `m` other than them being positive integers, and `num` can be any integer. The function creates a nested list where each sublist has exactly `m` elements, and all elements within each sublist are equal to `num`. This functionality covers all potential cases where `n`, `m`, and `num` are valid integers.
