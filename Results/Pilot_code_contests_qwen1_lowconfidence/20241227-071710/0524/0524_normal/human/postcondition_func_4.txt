The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and starts the execution of the `main` function with specific settings for the recursion limit and stack size. Specifically, it sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. After these settings are applied, a new thread is created and the `main` function is executed within this thread. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code itself, and the code does exactly what the annotations suggest.
