The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, where not both are zero. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function then returns the GCD as the first value (`x`) and `y`, which is set to 0 after the computation, as the second value. This function handles the case where `x` and `y` are both zero by ensuring the loop condition `while y:` is not met initially due to the given precondition that `x` and `y` are not both zero. If either `x` or `y` is zero initially, the function still correctly computes the GCD for the non-zero value.
