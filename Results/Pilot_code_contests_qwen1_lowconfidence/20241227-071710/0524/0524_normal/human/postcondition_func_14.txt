The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and does not return any value directly. Instead, it indirectly returns the result of calling `func_16` with either the integer 1 or a computed value of `ans`. The computed value of `ans` is derived through a series of operations involving `r` and `m` within a loop for `n` values greater than 1. Specifically, the function first calls `func_1()` to get an integer `n`, then if `n` is 1, it calls `func_16(1)`. Otherwise, it initializes `r` and `ans` to 1, and iterates through a loop from 2 to `n`, updating `r` and `ans` based on the current values of `r` and `m` (where `m` is `r
