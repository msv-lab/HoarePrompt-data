Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the core logic in `func_15()` is incorrect. Specifically, the loop and calculations inside `func_15()` do not align with the mathematical formula for calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. 

The correct formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus is \( n^2 + (n-1)^2 \). However, the annotated version demonstrates that `func_15()` uses a different and incorrect approach to calculate the number of cells. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is maintained.
