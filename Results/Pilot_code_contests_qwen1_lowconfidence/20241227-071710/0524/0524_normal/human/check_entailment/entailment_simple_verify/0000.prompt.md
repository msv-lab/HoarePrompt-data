You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a n-th order rhombus in a cell grid.

A 1-st order rhombus is just a square 1 × 1 (i.e just a cell).

A n-th order rhombus for all n ≥ 2 one obtains from a n-1-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).

<image>

Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Input

The first and only input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. The program defines several helper functions that are not used in the main logic.
2. The main logic is defined in `func_15()`, which attempts to compute the number of cells in the n-th order rhombus.
3. The core logic in `func_15()` uses a loop to calculate the number of cells but does not match the pattern described in the problem statement.

To understand the correct approach, let's derive the formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus:

- A 1st order rhombus has 1 cell.
- A 2nd order rhombus adds 4 more cells around the first cell, making a total of 5 cells.
- A 3rd order rhombus adds 8 more cells around the second layer, making a total of 13 cells.

From this pattern, we can see that each new layer adds 4 more cells than the previous layer. Therefore, the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cells} = n^2 + (n-1)^2 \]

Let's verify this formula for a few values:
- For \( n = 1 \): \( 1^2 + (1-1)^2 = 1 \)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( 2^2 + (2-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( 3^2 + (3-1)^2 = 9 + 4 = 13 \)

Now, let's correct the program to match this logic:

```python
def func_15():
    n = int(input())
    ans = n**2 + (n-1)**2
    print(ans)
```

This corrected program will output the correct number of cells for any given \( n \). Since the original program does not match this logic, it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
