Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus by following the recursive pattern described in the problem. 

The function `func_15` computes the number of cells for a given order `n` using a loop that iteratively adds the number of cells in each subsequent order, which matches the construction of a n-th order rhombus from a (n-1)-th order rhombus by adding surrounding cells. The logic used in `func_15` is consistent with the problem statement and the examples provided.

The annotated version confirms that the program correctly handles the input range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and performs the necessary calculations to determine the number of cells in the rhombus. There are no logical errors or discrepancies between the code and the problem description that would lead to incorrect results.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is maintained.
