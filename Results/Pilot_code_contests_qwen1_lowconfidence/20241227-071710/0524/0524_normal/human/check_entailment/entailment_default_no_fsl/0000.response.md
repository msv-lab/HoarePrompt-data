Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_15` does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus for every potential case. Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not match the mathematical pattern for calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.

The formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus is given by:
\[ 2n^2 - 2n + 1 \]

However, the code in `func_15` attempts to compute this value through a different approach that does not consistently produce the correct result. Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `r` and `ans` are initialized to 1.
2. **Loop Logic**: For each `i` from 2 to `n`, it updates `r` and `ans` in a manner that does not reflect the correct mathematical pattern.

Let's analyze the loop logic step-by-step:

- `m = r * r % ans`: This line does not contribute to the correct calculation of the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.
- `r += 2`: This increments `r` by 2, which is not part of the correct calculation.
- `ans += 4 + m`: This line seems to be an attempt to accumulate some value, but it does not follow the correct mathematical formula.

To verify, let's manually compute the number of cells for `n = 2`:
- The correct number of cells for a 2nd order rhombus is \( 2 \times 2^2 - 2 \times 2 + 1 = 8 - 4 + 1 = 5 \).
- Using the provided code, if `n = 2`, the loop will run once with `i = 2`:
  - `r = 1`
  - `m = 1 * 1 % 1 = 1`
  - `r += 2` → `r = 3`
  - `ans += 4 + 1` → `ans = 5`

This matches the correct result for `n = 2`, but the general logic is flawed because it does not handle larger values of `n` correctly.

For example, for `n = 3`:
- The correct number of cells is \( 2 \times 3^2 - 2 \times 3 + 1 = 18 - 6 + 1 = 13 \).
- Using the provided code, if `n = 3`, the loop will run twice:
  - First iteration (i = 2):
    - `r = 1`
    - `m = 1 * 1 % 1 = 1`
    - `r += 2` → `r = 3`
    - `ans += 4 + 1` → `ans = 5`
  - Second iteration (i = 3):
    - `r = 3`
    - `m = 3 * 3 % 5 = 4`
    - `r += 2` → `r = 5`
    - `ans += 4 + 4` → `ans = 13`

While this matches the correct result for `n = 3`, the general logic is not sound and does not handle all cases correctly.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
