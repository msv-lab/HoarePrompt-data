Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_15` does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus for all possible values of `n`. The logic used in `func_15` is flawed and does not match the recursive definition of the rhombus.

According to the problem description, a 1st order rhombus is a 1x1 square, and each subsequent order adds cells around the perimeter of the previous order. The correct formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus is \(4n^2 - 4n + 1\).

However, the current implementation in `func_15` uses a different approach that does not correctly compute the number of cells. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization**: The initial value of `r` and `ans` is set to 1, which does not match the base case for a 1st order rhombus (which is 1 cell).

2. **Loop Logic**: The loop updates `r` and `ans` in a manner that does not correctly represent the recursive addition of cells around the perimeter of the rhombus. The formula used inside the loop does not reflect the mathematical relationship between consecutive orders of the rhombus.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- For `n = 1`, the expected output is `1` (base case).
- For `n = 2`, the expected output is `5`.
- For `n = 3`, the expected output is `13`.

However, running the provided code with `n = 2` results in an incorrect output. The code incorrectly calculates the number of cells for higher orders as well.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
