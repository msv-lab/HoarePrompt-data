Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. The program defines several helper functions that are not used in the main logic.
2. The main logic is defined in `func_15()`, which attempts to compute the number of cells in the n-th order rhombus.
3. The core logic in `func_15()` uses a loop to calculate the number of cells but does not match the pattern described in the problem statement.

To understand the correct approach, let's derive the formula for the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus:

- A 1st order rhombus has 1 cell.
- A 2nd order rhombus adds 4 more cells around the first cell, making a total of 5 cells.
- A 3rd order rhombus adds 8 more cells around the second layer, making a total of 13 cells.

From this pattern, we can see that each new layer adds 4 more cells than the previous layer. Therefore, the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cells} = n^2 + (n-1)^2 \]

Let's verify this formula for a few values:
- For \( n = 1 \): \( 1^2 + (1-1)^2 = 1 \)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( 2^2 + (2-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( 3^2 + (3-1)^2 = 9 + 4 = 13 \)

Now, let's correct the program to match this logic:

```python
def func_15():
    n = int(input())
    ans = n**2 + (n-1)**2
    print(ans)
```

This corrected program will output the correct number of cells for any given \( n \). Since the original program does not match this logic, it is incorrect.
