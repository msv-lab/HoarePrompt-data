Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus as per the recursive pattern described. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Problem Description and Functionality**: The problem describes how an n-th order rhombus is constructed from a (n-1)-th order rhombus by adding surrounding cells. The function `func_15` follows this pattern by initializing `r` and `ans` to 1 and then iterating from 2 to `n`, updating `r` and `ans` accordingly.

2. **Correct Calculation**: The calculation inside the loop correctly updates `r` (which represents the side length of the rhombus) and `ans` (which stores the total number of cells). Each iteration adds 4 more cells to the total count, plus the square of the current `r` modulo `ans`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the base case correctly when `n` is 1, returning 1 as a 1st-order rhombus is a 1x1 square.

4. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly reads an integer input from the user, ensuring it is within the valid range of 1 to 100. Although the annotations suggest no error handling for invalid inputs, the problem statement assumes valid input, making this a reasonable assumption.

5. **No Missing Functionality**: All necessary steps to compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus are present and follow the recursive pattern accurately.

Therefore, based on the annotations and the problem description, the program correctly computes the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus and maintains the original assessment of correctness as True.
