You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a n-th order rhombus in a cell grid.

A 1-st order rhombus is just a square 1 × 1 (i.e just a cell).

A n-th order rhombus for all n ≥ 2 one obtains from a n-1-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).

<image>

Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Input

The first and only input line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.

Output

Print exactly one integer — the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The function `func_15` computes the number of cells for a given order `n` by following the recursive pattern described in the problem. Specifically, it uses a loop to iteratively calculate the number of cells added in each step, which matches the description of how a n-th order rhombus is constructed from a (n-1)-th order rhombus by adding surrounding cells.

Given the examples provided:

- For `n = 1`, the output is `1`, which is correct as a 1st-order rhombus is a 1x1 square.
- For `n = 2`, the output is `5`, which is correct as a 2nd-order rhombus consists of a 1st-order rhombus plus 4 additional cells around it.
- For `n = 3`, the output is `13`, which is correct as a 3rd-order rhombus consists of a 2nd-order rhombus plus additional cells around it.

The formula used in the program is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples and matches the recursive construction of the rhombus. Since the program handles the calculation correctly for all tested cases and the logic appears sound, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user within the range of 1 to 100
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` prompts the user to input an integer within the range of 1 to 100. If the user inputs a value outside this range, the behavior is undefined as the code does not handle such cases. The function returns the integer input by the user.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no precondition provided for the function `func_2` based on the variables in its signature since it does not take any parameters. However, it is expected to read an integer input from the user, which represents the order of the rhombus (n).
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns an integer input from the user representing the order of the rhombus (n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer input from the user and returns it as the order of the rhombus (n). It does not accept any parameters. The function assumes that the user will provide a valid integer input. If the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. No error handling is included to manage such cases.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_3()` are mentioned in the problem description or the function signature. The function does not take any parameters and returns a map object that maps input integers from user input. However, based on the context, it seems the function is expected to receive an integer `n` as input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that maps input integers from user input within the range 1 to 100
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` takes no explicit parameters but expects an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) to be provided as input through standard input. It reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual string elements based on spaces, converts each string element to an integer, and returns a map object that contains these integers as key-value pairs. If the input does not conform to the specified range or format, the function will still attempt to convert the input to integers and create a map, potentially resulting in a map with fewer entries than the number of space-separated values provided, depending on the input validity.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct information about the variables in the function `func_4`, but based on the problem description and the context, `func_4` seems to be a helper function that returns a list generated by another function `func_3`. However, without the definition of `func_3`, we can only infer that `func_4` returns a list, which is likely related to the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus as described in the problem.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_3(), which is related to the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by calling another function `func_3()`, which is presumed to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Since the actual implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, the exact nature of the list returned by `func_4()` cannot be determined precisely. However, it is clear that the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns this list. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `func_3()` might return an empty list or a list with specific properties (e.g., length, contents). If `func_3()` does not handle certain inputs correctly, those cases would also be relevant edge cases.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None, as the function `func_5` does not take any parameters and its purpose is to start the execution of the main function with specific settings for recursion limit and stack size.
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and starts the execution of the `main` function with specific settings for the recursion limit and stack size. Specifically, it sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. After these settings are applied, a new thread is created and the `main` function is executed within this thread. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code itself, and the code does exactly what the annotations suggest.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list containing at least one element, where the first element is an integer representing the order of the rhombus (1 ≤ item[0] ≤ 100).
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
    #The program returns the first element of the tuple or list `item`, which is an integer representing the order of the rhombus and is within the range of 1 to 100
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list containing at least one element. The first element of `item` is an integer representing the order of the rhombus, and it must be within the range of 1 to 100. The function returns this integer. If `item` does not meet these conditions, the function will still execute but may result in incorrect behavior or errors due to the lack of validation checks in the provided code. The postcondition of the function is that it returns the first element of `item`, ensuring it is an integer between 1 and 100. However, the function does not validate the type and value constraints of `item`, which could lead to undefined behavior if the input does not conform to the specified requirements.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers.
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns a list of integers from 'l' sorted based on the values returned by the 'getKey' function for each element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. It returns a new list of integers from `l` sorted based on the values returned by the `getKey` function for each element. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code that need special handling, and the code accurately reflects the annotations.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the order of the rhombus (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), m is an integer representing the width of the returned list, and num is an integer representing the value to fill in each cell of the list.
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing n sublists, each of which contains m elements, all set to num
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list containing `n` sublists, each of which contains `m` elements, all set to `num`. There are no constraints on `n` and `m` other than them being positive integers, and `num` can be any integer. The function creates a nested list where each sublist has exactly `m` elements, and all elements within each sublist are equal to `num`. This functionality covers all potential cases where `n`, `m`, and `num` are valid integers.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100.
def func_9(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns False if x is not a power of 2, and True if x is a power of 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\) and returns `True` if `x` is a power of 2, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses a bitwise operation to determine if `x` is a power of 2. Specifically, it checks if `x` and `x - 1` have no bits in common (i.e., their bitwise AND is zero), which is true only if `x` is a power of 2. This method covers all valid inputs within the specified range and correctly identifies powers of 2, including the edge case where `x` is 1 (which is a power of 2). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns a binary string representation of integer 'n' without the '0b' prefix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly converts the integer to its binary form using Python's built-in `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionalities since the provided code accurately implements the described behavior.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the number 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 100 and returns a list of its digits. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the function converts `n` into a string, iterates over each character in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. This list is then returned. Since `n` is guaranteed to be within the specified range, no special handling for edge cases such as leading zeros or negative numbers is necessary. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program has a list of integers representing the digits of `n`.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and p is a positive integer. The function computes the modular exponentiation of x^y under modulo p, meaning it calculates (x^y) mod p.
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is \( x^{2^k} \% p1 \), where \( k \) is the number of iterations of the loop, `y` is 0, `p` is a positive integer, and `res` is \( res * x^{2^k} \% p \)
    return res
    #The program returns res which is calculated as res * x^(2^k) % p for each iteration of the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are integers and `p` is a positive integer. It calculates the modular exponentiation of `x^y` under modulo `p`, meaning it computes `(x^y) mod p`. 

The function uses a loop to perform the modular exponentiation efficiently using the method of exponentiation by squaring. Within each iteration of the loop:
- If the current value of `y` is odd, it multiplies `res` by `x` modulo `p`.
- It then squares `x` and reduces it modulo `p`.
- It shifts `y` right by one bit (equivalent to integer division by 2).

After the loop, the function returns `res`, which is the result of the modular exponentiation calculation.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The annotation mentions `p1` in the line `x = x * x % p1`, but `p1` is not defined in the function. This should be `p` instead.
- The function does not handle the case where `y` is negative. While the provided annotations suggest `y > 0`, in practice, `y` could be negative, and the function should handle such cases appropriately, possibly returning an error or handling it based on the requirements.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers where x and y are not both zero.
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the GCD of the original values of x and y, and y, which is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, where not both are zero. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function then returns the GCD as the first value (`x`) and `y`, which is set to 0 after the computation, as the second value. This function handles the case where `x` and `y` are both zero by ensuring the loop condition `while y:` is not met initially due to the given precondition that `x` and `y` are not both zero. If either `x` or `y` is zero initially, the function still correctly computes the GCD for the non-zero value.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
def func_14(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and n is greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and n is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and n is greater than 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and n is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, greater than 3, not divisible by 2, and not divisible by 3, and `i` is greater than or equal to 109, and `n` is not divisible by any number `i` or `(i + 2)` where `i` is an integer.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. It returns `False` for values of `n` that do not meet specific criteria and `True` for the value `n = 7`. Specifically:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 8, the function returns `False`.
- If `n` is 7, the function returns `True`.
- For other values of `n` between 1 and 100 (excluding 7), the function returns `False`.

The function checks if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, and then uses a loop to check divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If `n` passes all these checks, it returns `True`, which only happens when `n` is 7.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). If `n` is 1, then `func_16(1)` has been called. Otherwise, `n` is at least 100, and the following variables are defined: `r = 2k + 1` where `k` starts from 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration; `ans = 4m + 1` where `m` starts from 1 and increments based on the value of `m` in the previous iteration; `i = n`; `m = r^2 \% ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts no parameters and does not return any value directly. Instead, it indirectly returns the result of calling `func_16` with either the integer 1 or a computed value of `ans`. The computed value of `ans` is derived through a series of operations involving `r` and `m` within a loop for `n` values greater than 1. Specifically, the function first calls `func_1()` to get an integer `n`, then if `n` is 1, it calls `func_16(1)`. Otherwise, it initializes `r` and `ans` to 1, and iterates through a loop from 2 to `n`, updating `r` and `ans` based on the current values of `r` and `m` (where `m` is `r

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not use the provided arguments and is not relevant to the problem of computing the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Therefore, there are no valid input variables from the given program that pertain to the problem description.
def func_16():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` to itself, `at_start` is `False`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and then written the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to itself, `at_start` is `False`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the method flushes the output stream.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16()` does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to print a sequence of items (represented by `args`) to a specified output stream (`file`). It writes each item in `args` to the stream, separated by a specified separator (`sep`), and appends a specified end character (`end`). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, it also flushes the output stream. However, since the function does not utilize any input arguments provided in the problem description, it essentially behaves as a placeholder and does not perform any meaningful computation related to the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Any input arguments provided are ignored.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
