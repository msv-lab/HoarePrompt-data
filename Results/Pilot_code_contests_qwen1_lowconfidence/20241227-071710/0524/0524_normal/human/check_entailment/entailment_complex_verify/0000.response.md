Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not meet the problem description. Based on the annotated version, it is clear that the program does not implement the logic to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus as described. The function `func_15` attempts to compute the number of cells but uses an incorrect approach. Specifically, it initializes `r` and `ans` to 1 and updates them in a way that does not align with the correct formula \( n^2 + (n-1)^2 \). The loop and updates to `r` and `ans` do not reflect the pattern of adding cells around the existing structure as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program remains incorrect.
