Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the `func_15` function correctly calculates the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. However, upon closer inspection, the `func_15` function does not actually contain the logic to compute the number of cells. Instead, it calls `func_16` with no arguments, which simply prints values without performing any relevant computation. This means that the program does not implement the required functionality to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus based on the given order `n`.

Given the output hints, it is clear that `func_16` is intended to print values but does not perform the necessary calculations. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is not correct.
