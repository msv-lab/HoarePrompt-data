Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The function `func_15()` attempts to compute the number of cells but uses a complex and incorrect approach that does not match the derived formula \( n^2 + (n-1)^2 \). Additionally, the function `func_16()` is a placeholder and does not contribute to the calculation of the number of cells in the rhombus. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
