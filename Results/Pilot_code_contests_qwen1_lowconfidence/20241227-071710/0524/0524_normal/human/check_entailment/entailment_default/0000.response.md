Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_15` does not correctly compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The function starts by calling `func_1()`, which returns the input integer `n`. However, the logic inside `func_15` does not follow the correct formula to calculate the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus.

For an n-th order rhombus, the number of cells can be calculated using the formula: \(4n^2 - 4n + 1\).

The current implementation of `func_15` does not use this formula. Instead, it performs a series of operations that do not yield the correct result for any n > 1. Specifically, it initializes `r` and `ans` to 1 and then iterates through a loop, updating `r` and `ans` in a way that does not correspond to the correct calculation of the number of cells in a rhombus.

To demonstrate, let's consider a few cases:

- For \(n = 1\): The correct number of cells is 1.
- For \(n = 2\): The correct number of cells is 5.
- For \(n = 3\): The correct number of cells is 13.

However, the current implementation of `func_15` does not produce these results. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
