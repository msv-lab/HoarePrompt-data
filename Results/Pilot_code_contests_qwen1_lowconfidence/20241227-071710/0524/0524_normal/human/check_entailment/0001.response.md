Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. The function `func_15` computes the number of cells for a given order `n` by following the recursive pattern described in the problem. Specifically, it uses a loop to iteratively calculate the number of cells added in each step, which matches the description of how a n-th order rhombus is constructed from a (n-1)-th order rhombus by adding surrounding cells.

Given the examples provided:

- For `n = 1`, the output is `1`, which is correct as a 1st-order rhombus is a 1x1 square.
- For `n = 2`, the output is `5`, which is correct as a 2nd-order rhombus consists of a 1st-order rhombus plus 4 additional cells around it.
- For `n = 3`, the output is `13`, which is correct as a 3rd-order rhombus consists of a 2nd-order rhombus plus additional cells around it.

The formula used in the program is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples and matches the recursive construction of the rhombus. Since the program handles the calculation correctly for all tested cases and the logic appears sound, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
