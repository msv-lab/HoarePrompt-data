Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Incorrect Function Calls:**
   - The function `func_15()` is called, which reads the input and processes it, but this function is not defined in the annotated code. There is no function named `func_15()` that processes the input and computes the number of cells in the rhombus.
   
2. **Lack of Logic Implementation:**
   - The function `func_15()` does not contain the necessary logic to compute the number of cells in the n-th order rhombus. It initializes some variables (`n`, `r`, and `ans`) and iterates through a loop, but it does not correctly implement the formula to calculate the number of cells in a rhombus.

3. **Unnecessary Functions:**
   - Several functions like `func_2()`, `func_3()`, `func_4()`, `func_6()`, etc., are defined but are not used or do not contribute to solving the problem of calculating the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. These functions seem to be part of other unrelated functionalities or are placeholders.

4. **Output Printing:**
   - Even if `func_15()` had the correct logic, the final output is printed using `func_16()`, which is not correctly formatted according to the problem description. The function `func_16()` does not handle printing a single integer as required.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Read Input:** Read the integer `n` from the input.
2. **Compute the Number of Cells:** Use the formula to compute the number of cells in the n-th order rhombus. For an n-th order rhombus, the number of cells is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{cells} = n^2 + 2 \times (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1)) = n^2 + n \times (n-1)
   \]
3. **Print the Result:** Print the computed number of cells.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def compute_cells(n):
    return n**2 + n * (n - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    result = compute_cells(n)
    print(result)
```

This program correctly reads the input, computes the number of cells in the n-th order rhombus, and prints the result, thus meeting the problem description.
