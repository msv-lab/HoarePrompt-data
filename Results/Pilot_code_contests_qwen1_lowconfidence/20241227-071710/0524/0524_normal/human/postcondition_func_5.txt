The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list containing at least one element. The first element of `item` is an integer representing the order of the rhombus, and it must be within the range of 1 to 100. The function returns this integer. If `item` does not meet these conditions, the function will still execute but may result in incorrect behavior or errors due to the lack of validation checks in the provided code. The postcondition of the function is that it returns the first element of `item`, ensuring it is an integer between 1 and 100. However, the function does not validate the type and value constraints of `item`, which could lead to undefined behavior if the input does not conform to the specified requirements.
