There is no direct information about the variables in the function `func_4`, but based on the problem description and the context, `func_4` seems to be a helper function that returns a list generated by another function `func_3`. However, without the definition of `func_3`, we can only infer that `func_4` returns a list, which is likely related to the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus as described in the problem.
