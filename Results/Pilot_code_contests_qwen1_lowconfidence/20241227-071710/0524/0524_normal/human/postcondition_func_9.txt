The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and returns a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly converts the integer to its binary form using Python's built-in `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionalities since the provided code accurately implements the described behavior.
