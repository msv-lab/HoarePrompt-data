The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables (`args`, `sep`, `file`, and `str(x)`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `file` has written `str(x)` to itself, `at_start` is `False`.
