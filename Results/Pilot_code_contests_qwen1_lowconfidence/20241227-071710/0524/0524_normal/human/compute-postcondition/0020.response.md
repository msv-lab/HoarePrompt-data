The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` performs the following actions:
- It removes the `'end'` key from the `kwargs` dictionary and stores the corresponding value (which defaults to `b'\n'` if `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`) into the `file.write()` function.
- This value (either `kwargs['end']` or `b'\n'`) is then written to the `file`.

Given the initial state:
- `args` must contain at least one element.
- `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`.
- `file` has written the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` to itself.
- `at_start` is `False`.

After executing the code, the value of `file` changes because it writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to itself. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `args` must contain at least one element.
- `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`.
- `file` has written the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and then written the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to itself.
- `at_start` is `False`.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and then written the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to itself, `at_start` is `False`.**
