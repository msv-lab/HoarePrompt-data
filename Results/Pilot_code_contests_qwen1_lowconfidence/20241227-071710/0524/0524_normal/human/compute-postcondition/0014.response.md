Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - `args` must contain at least one element.
   - `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`.
   - `file` has written `str(x) + sep + str(x)` to itself.
   - `at_start` is `False`.

2. **Determine the loop condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.

3. **Analyze the loop body:**
   - For each `x` in `args`, `str(x) + sep + str(x)` is written to `file`.

4. **Identify changes made during the loop iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `args`, `x` will take the value of the next element in `args`.
   - `sep` remains unchanged within the loop (it is either `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`).
   - `file` is updated with `str(x) + sep + str(x)`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - `args` must still contain at least one element because if it were empty, the loop would not have started.
   - `sep` remains unchanged.
   - `file` will have an additional entry `str(x) + sep + str(x)` written to it.
   - `at_start` becomes `True` at the beginning of the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `args` must contain at least one element.
- `sep` remains the same.
- `file` will have an additional entry written to it.
- `at_start` is `True`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written another `str(x) + sep + str(x)` to itself, `at_start` is `True`**
