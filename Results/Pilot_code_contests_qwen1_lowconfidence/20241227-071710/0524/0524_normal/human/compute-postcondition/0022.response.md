The code `file.flush()` is called, which flushes the file buffer, meaning it writes any buffered data to the file immediately. However, the initial state specifies that the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `False`, indicating that flushing was not explicitly requested by popping the 'flush' key from `kwargs`. Since the flush operation is performed, the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` changes to `True` to reflect this action.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and then written the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to itself, `at_start` is `False`, `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`.**
