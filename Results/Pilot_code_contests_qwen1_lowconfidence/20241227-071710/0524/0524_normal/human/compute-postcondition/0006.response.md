Postcondition: ***`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`. If `not at_start` is true, then `file.write(sep)` has been executed and `at_start` is now `False`. If `not at_start` is false, then no changes occur to `args`, `sep`, or `file`.***
