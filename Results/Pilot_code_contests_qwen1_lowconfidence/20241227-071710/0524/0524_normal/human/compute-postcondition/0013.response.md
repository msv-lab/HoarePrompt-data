The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect the values of `args`, `sep`, or `file`. The precondition that `args` must contain at least one element and that `at_start` is `False` remains valid.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written `str(x) + sep + str(x)` to itself, `at_start` is `False`**
