The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. Since `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, and `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, the `write` method is called on the file object. The `at_start` variable's value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `file.write(sep)` has been executed, `at_start` is `False`**
