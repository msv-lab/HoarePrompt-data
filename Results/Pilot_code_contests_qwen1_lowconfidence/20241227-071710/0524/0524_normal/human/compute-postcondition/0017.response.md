`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know that `file` will now contain the string representation of `x` appended to its current content. The other variables (`args`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written the string representation of `x` to itself, and `at_start` is `False`.**
