The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file `file`. Since `file` has already written `str(x) + sep` to itself before this line, writing `str(x)` again will append `str(x)` to whatever was already written.

Given the initial state:
- `args` must contain at least one element
- `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`
- `file` has written `str(x) + sep` to itself
- `at_start` is `False`

After executing the code:
- `file` will now have written `str(x) + sep` followed by `str(x)`.
- `args`, `sep`, and `at_start` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written `str(x) + sep + str(x)` to itself, `at_start` is `False`**
