Functionality: **The function `func_16()` does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to print a sequence of items (represented by `args`) to a specified output stream (`file`). It writes each item in `args` to the stream, separated by a specified separator (`sep`), and appends a specified end character (`end`). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, it also flushes the output stream. However, since the function does not utilize any input arguments provided in the problem description, it essentially behaves as a placeholder and does not perform any meaningful computation related to the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Any input arguments provided are ignored.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `args` contains at least one element. If `args` is empty, the function will not perform any writing operations, which might lead to unexpected behavior if this case is not handled elsewhere in the calling code.
- The function does not check if `file` is valid or if it supports the write operation. If `file` is invalid or does not support writing, the function could raise an exception.
- The function does not validate the types of `sep` and `end`. While the default type for `sep` is `bytes` and for `end` is also `bytes`, using non-string types could lead to type errors.
