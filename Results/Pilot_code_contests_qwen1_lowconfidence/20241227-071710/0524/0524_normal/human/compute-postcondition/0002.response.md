`at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The variables `sep` and `file` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
