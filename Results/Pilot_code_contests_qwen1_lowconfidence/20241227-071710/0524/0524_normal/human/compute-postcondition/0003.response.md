Let's break down the given situation step by step:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `args`.
   - Inside the loop body, `x` represents each element of `args`.

2. **Determine Necessary States:**
   - For the loop to execute, `args` must be a non-empty iterable. The loop will start with the first element of `args` and continue until all elements are processed.

3. **Initial State Given:**
   - `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`.
   - `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - `at_start` being `True` indicates the initial state before the loop starts.
   - Since the loop iterates over `args`, `args` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `args` must contain at least one element.
- `sep` remains as is, either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`.
- `file` remains as is, either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`.

Therefore, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout`**
