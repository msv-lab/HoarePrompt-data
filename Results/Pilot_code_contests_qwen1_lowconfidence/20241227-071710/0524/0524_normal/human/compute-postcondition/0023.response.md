Postcondition: ***`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and then written the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to itself, `at_start` is `False`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the method flushes the output stream.***
