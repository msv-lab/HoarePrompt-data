`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `file`. Since `file` has already written `str(x)` to itself before this line of code, the output of `str(x)` followed by `sep` will be written to `file`. The states of the other variables (`args`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written `str(x) + sep` to itself, `at_start` is `True`**
