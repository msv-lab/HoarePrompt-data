The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. Since `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, it remains unchanged. The value of `file` is updated to include the additional `sep` that was written. The variables `args`, `at_start` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` or `b' '`, `file` has written another `sep` to itself, `at_start` is `True`**
