The function `func_9` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\) and returns `True` if `x` is a power of 2, otherwise it returns `False`. The function uses a bitwise operation to determine if `x` is a power of 2. Specifically, it checks if `x` and `x - 1` have no bits in common (i.e., their bitwise AND is zero), which is true only if `x` is a power of 2. This method covers all valid inputs within the specified range and correctly identifies powers of 2, including the edge case where `x` is 1 (which is a power of 2). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
