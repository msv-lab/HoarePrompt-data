The function `func_16()` does not accept any parameters and its primary action is to print a sequence of items (represented by `args`) to a specified output stream (`file`). It writes each item in `args` to the stream, separated by a specified separator (`sep`), and appends a specified end character (`end`). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, it also flushes the output stream. However, since the function does not utilize any input arguments provided in the problem description, it essentially behaves as a placeholder and does not perform any meaningful computation related to the number of cells in an n-th order rhombus. Any input arguments provided are ignored.
