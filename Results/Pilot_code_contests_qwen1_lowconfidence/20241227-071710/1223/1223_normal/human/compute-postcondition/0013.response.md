The variable `at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of the other variables (`S`, `sep`, `args`, and the value written to the file) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is ' ', `at_start` is False, and a value has been written to the file which is the string representation of `x`.**
