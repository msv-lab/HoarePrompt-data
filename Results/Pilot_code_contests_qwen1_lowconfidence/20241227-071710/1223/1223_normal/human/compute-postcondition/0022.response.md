The code `file.flush()` is called, which flushes the file buffers, ensuring that all pending output is written to the file. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `S`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, or the end value. The value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` remains `True`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else ' ', `file` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the end value written to `file` is `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. The value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`. File buffers are flushed.**
