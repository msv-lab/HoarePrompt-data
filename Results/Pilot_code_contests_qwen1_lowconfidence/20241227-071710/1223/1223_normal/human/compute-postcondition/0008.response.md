The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `at_start`. This does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `at_start` is now `False`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, else the value of 'sep', `file` has written `sep` to it, `at_start` is `False`, and `args` must contain at least one element; `x` is a variable whose string representation is written to `file`.**
