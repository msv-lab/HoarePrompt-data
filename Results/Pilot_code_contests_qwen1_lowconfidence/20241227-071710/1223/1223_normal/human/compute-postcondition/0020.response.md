The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the program by writing the value associated with the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary to the file specified by `file`. If `'end'` is not provided in `kwargs`, it defaults to `\n`.

Given the initial state:
- `S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters.
- `sep` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else ' '.
- `file` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- The string representations of all elements in `args` have been written to `file` with each element preceded by `sep` except the first one.

Since the code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` only affects `file`, `kwargs`, and `end`, we need to update these variables. The value of `end` is now what was originally in `kwargs` under the key `'end'`, or `\n` if the key was not present. The `file` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else ' ', `file` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the end value written to `file` is `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`.**
