The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` does the following:
- It attempts to pop the value associated with the key `'sep'` from the dictionary `kwargs`. If `'sep'` is not in `kwargs`, it defaults to the string `' '`.
- It then attempts to pop the value associated with the key `'file'` from the dictionary `kwargs`. If `'file'` is not in `kwargs`, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

Since the initial state only mentions that `S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, no changes are made to `S` by the given code. The variables `sep` and `file` are introduced and assigned values based on the `kwargs` dictionary.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, else the value of 'sep', `file` is `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, else the value of 'file'.**
