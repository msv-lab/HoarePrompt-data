The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `S`, `sep`, and `file` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, else the value of 'sep', `file` is `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, else the value of 'file'; `at_start` is `True`.
