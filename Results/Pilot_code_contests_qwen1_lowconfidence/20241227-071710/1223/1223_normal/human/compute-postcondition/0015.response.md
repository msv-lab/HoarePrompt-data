The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is ' ') into the file. This does not change the values of the variables `S`, `at_start`, or `sep`. The state of `S` remains a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` remains ' ', and `at_start` remains True.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is ' ', `at_start` is True**
