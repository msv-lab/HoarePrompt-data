The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x`. Since no value for `x` is given, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. But we know that the string `S` remains unchanged, `sep` remains `' '`, and `at_start` remains `False`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is ' ', `at_start` is False, and the string representation of `x` is written to the file.**
