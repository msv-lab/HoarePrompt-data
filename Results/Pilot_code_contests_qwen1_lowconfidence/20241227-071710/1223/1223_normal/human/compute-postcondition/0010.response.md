The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. Based on the initial state, `sep` is either ' ' or the value passed in `kwargs` if `sep` was provided. Since `sep` was not specified in the example, it defaults to ' '.

The variables `S`, `at_start`, and `args` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:
- `S` remains a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters.
- `sep` remains ' '.
- `at_start` remains `False`.
- `args` remains with at least one element remaining.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is ' ', `at_start` is `False`, and `args` contains at least one element remaining**
