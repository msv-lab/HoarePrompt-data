Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters.
   - `sep` is either ' ' (if 'sep' was not specified in `kwargs`) or the value of 'sep' (if 'sep' was specified).
   - `file` is `sys.stdout` (if 'file' was not specified in `kwargs`) or the value of 'file' (if 'file' was specified).
   - `at_start` is `True`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements in `args`.
   - For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we only need to ensure that `args` is not empty.
   - The values of `S`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not directly affect the loop's execution. However, we should still include them in the state description as they are part of the initial program state.

### Final Answer:

State: **`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, else the value of 'sep', `file` is `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, else the value of 'file', `at_start` is `True`, `args` must contain at least one element**
