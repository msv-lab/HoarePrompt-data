The function `func_1` takes no parameters and processes a 4-character string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters. It counts the occurrences of each character in `s`, storing these counts in a list `s`. It then calls `func_2` with either 'Yes' or 'No', depending on whether the counts are exactly two occurrences of two different characters (i.e., the list `s` is equal to `[2, 2]`). If the counts do not match this condition, `func_2` is called with 'No'. An edge case is when `s` does not have exactly four characters, which would cause `Counter(input())` to raise an error if `input()` is not properly constrained. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `s` contains duplicate characters other than the two required, which would still result in `s == [2, 2]` being true.
