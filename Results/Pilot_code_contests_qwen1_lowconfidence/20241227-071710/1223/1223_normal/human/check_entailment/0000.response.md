Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to check if the string `S` consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice. 

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. The function `func_1` reads a 4-character string `S` and uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in `S`.
2. It checks if the values returned by `Counter` are `[2, 2]`, indicating that there are exactly two distinct characters each appearing twice.
3. However, the logic in `func_2` is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the main logic.

The issue lies in the condition `s == [2, 2]`. This condition only checks if there are exactly two different characters each appearing twice. However, it does not account for the case where there are exactly two kinds of characters but their counts are not necessarily 2 and 2. For example, the string "AAAA" would pass this check, but according to the problem description, it should not be considered valid because all characters are the same.

To fix this, we need to ensure that there are exactly two distinct characters, each appearing exactly twice. We can achieve this by checking the length of the set of unique characters and ensuring each character appears exactly twice.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def is_valid_string(s):
    char_count = Counter(s)
    unique_chars = len(char_count)
    return unique_chars == 2 and all(count == 2 for count in char_count.values())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = input().strip()
    if is_valid_string(s):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```

This corrected version ensures that the string has exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing exactly twice, which aligns with the problem description.
