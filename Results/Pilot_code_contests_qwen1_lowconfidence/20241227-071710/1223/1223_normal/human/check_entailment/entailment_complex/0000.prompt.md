You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

def func_1():

    func_2('Yes' if s == [2, 2] else 'No')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and processes a 4-character string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters. It counts the occurrences of each character in `s`, storing these counts in a list `s`. It then calls `func_2` with either 'Yes' or 'No', depending on whether the counts are exactly two occurrences of two different characters (i.e., the list `s` is equal to `[2, 2]`). If the counts do not match this condition, `func_2` is called with 'No'. An edge case is when `s` does not have exactly four characters, which would cause `Counter(input())` to raise an error if `input()` is not properly constrained. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `s` contains duplicate characters other than the two required, which would still result in `s == [2, 2]` being true.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else ' ', `file` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the string representations of all elements in `args` have been written to `file` with each element preceded by `sep` except the first one.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`S` is a string consisting of exactly 4 uppercase English letters, `sep` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else ' ', `file` is the value passed in `kwargs` if provided, else `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the end value written to `file` is `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, file buffers are flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a variable number of arguments `args`, and keyword arguments `kwargs`. It writes the string representations of these arguments to a specified output stream (`file`), separated by a specified separator (`sep`), and ends with a specified end character. If `flush` is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not return anything. After executing, the `file` stream will contain the concatenated string representations of the arguments with the specified separator and end character, and the `sep`, `file`, and `end` values from `kwargs` will be reflected in the final state. If no `sep` or `end` is provided, default values (' ' and '\n') are used respectively.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
