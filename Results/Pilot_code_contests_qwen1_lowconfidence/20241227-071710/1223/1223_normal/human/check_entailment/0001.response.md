Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a 4-character string consists of exactly two kinds of characters, each appearing twice. The logic uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each character and then checks if the counts are `[2, 2]`. This logic covers all potential cases:

1. **ASSA**: Counts are `[2, 2]`, so it prints `Yes`.
2. **FFEE**: Counts are `[2, 2]`, so it prints `Yes`.
3. **FREE**: Counts are `[1, 1, 2]`, so it prints `No`.
4. **STOP**: Counts are `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, so it prints `No`.

Since the program correctly handles all given examples and the constraints, it works as expected for all potential cases.
