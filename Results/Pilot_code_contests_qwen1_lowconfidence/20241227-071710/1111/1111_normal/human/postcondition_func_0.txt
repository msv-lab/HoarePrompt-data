The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c`. It constructs a `h` by `w` matrix called `base` where `base[i][j]` is 1 if and only if `i < r[j]` or `j < c[i]`. After constructing the matrix, it checks for certain conditions and calls `func_2` with the appropriate argument if these conditions are met. If no conditions are met, it calculates the value of `n` as the count of valid pairs `(j, i)` where `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i`, and then calls `func_2` with `2^n mod 1000000007`. Finally, the function returns `None`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `h` or `w` is 1, the matrix `base` will be very small, and the conditions checked in the loops will be simpler.
- If `r` or `c` contains values that exceed the dimensions of the matrix, the function still constructs the matrix correctly, but the conditions will not be evaluated for those out-of-bounds indices.
- If both `r` and `c` are empty lists, the matrix `base` will remain empty, and the function will return `None` without calling `func_2`.

Missing functionality includes:
- There are no explicit error checks for invalid input values or types, which could lead to runtime errors if the input does not conform to the specified constraints.
- The function does not handle the case where `h` or `w` is 0, which would result in an empty matrix and potentially unexpected behavior in subsequent checks.
