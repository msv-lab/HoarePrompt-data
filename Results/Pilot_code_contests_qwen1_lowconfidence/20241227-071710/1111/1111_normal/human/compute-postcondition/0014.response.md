According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `args`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\);
- `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\);
- `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq h\);
- `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for each \(1 \leq j \leq w\);
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`;
- `file` now contains the string representation of `sep` followed by the string representation of `x`;
- `at_start` is `False`;
- `args` is a non-empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must contain at least one element. Since `args` is a non-empty list, it will always contain at least one element unless it becomes empty due to the loop body modifying it.

At the end of the previous iteration, `args` still contains at least one element, so the loop can continue if no modifications inside the loop body make `args` empty.

Since no specific modifications to `args` inside the loop body are mentioned, we assume that `args` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should remain the same as the given state because the loop condition is based on `args` having at least one element, which it does.

State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\); `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\); `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq h\); `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for each \(1 \leq j \leq w\); `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`; `file` now contains the string representation of `sep` followed by the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a non-empty list.**
