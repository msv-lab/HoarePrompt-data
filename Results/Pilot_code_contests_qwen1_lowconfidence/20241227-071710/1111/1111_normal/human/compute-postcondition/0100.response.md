To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `h` is 1
   - `w` is a positive integer
   - `n` is the sum of `(r[2] < j and c[j] < 2)` for all `j` in the range from 1 to `w-1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 1 to `w-1`.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements:**
   For the loop to execute, there must be at least one value of `j` in the range from 1 to `w-1` that satisfies the condition `(r[2] < j and c[j] < 2)`.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `n` is defined based on the values of `r[2]` and `c[j]`.
   - The loop will run as long as `w > 1` (since the range is from 1 to `w-1`).

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 1, because if `w` is 1 or less, the loop would not run. Additionally, `n` should be non-zero, meaning there must be at least one valid `j` such that `(r[2] < j and c[j] < 2)`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `w` must be greater than 1
- `n` must be greater than 0

So, the final state after adjustment would be:

State: **`i` is 2, `h` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
