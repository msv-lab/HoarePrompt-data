The function `func_2(pow(2, n, 1000000007))` is called. This function call does not provide additional information about what `func_2` does, but it calculates `pow(2, n, 1000000007)` and passes the result to `func_2`. The value of `n` is unchanged, and the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, `r`, and `base` remain in their initial states.

Since the function call itself does not assign any new values to the variables listed in the initial state, the only change is the computation of the power operation which is passed to `func_2`. However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_2`, we cannot determine if this function modifies any of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the additional information that `func_2` was called with the computed value.

Output State: **`i` is either `h-1` or `w` depending on whether the loop executed or not, `n` is the cumulative count of valid pairs \((j, i)\) for all \( i \) from `1` to `h-1`, and for all `j` where `0 \leq j < w`, either `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1; `func_2` was called with the value `pow(2, n, 1000000007)`**
