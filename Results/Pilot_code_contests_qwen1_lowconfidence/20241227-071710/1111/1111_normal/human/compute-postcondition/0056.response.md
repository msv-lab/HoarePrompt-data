The function `func_2(0)` is called with an argument of 0. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine what changes it makes to the variables. Given the lack of information about `func_2`, the only thing we can say for certain is that the call to `func_2` might affect the variables within its scope. Since no specific details about `func_2` are provided, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, the current value of `r[0]` is less than `w` and `base[0][r[0]]` equals 1**
