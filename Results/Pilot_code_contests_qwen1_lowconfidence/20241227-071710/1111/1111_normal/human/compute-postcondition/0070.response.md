The code `func_2(0)` calls the function `func_2` with the argument `0`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so its exact behavior cannot be determined. The only variables mentioned are `i`, `h`, `w`, `c[i]`, and `base[c[i]][i]`, but their values will not change because the function call does not modify them.

Since the function `func_2` is not defined, the only thing we can infer is that the call to `func_2(0)` has taken place. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `h`, where `h` is within the range `[0, w-1]`, `c[i]` is less than `h`, and the value of `base[c[i]][i]` is `1`; a function call `func_2(0)` has occurred.**
