The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c`. The constraints are that `h` and `w` are integers such that \(1 \leq h, w \leq 10^3\); `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq h\); and `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for each \(1 \leq j \leq w\).

There is no specified return value given directly in the problem statement, but based on the typical structure of functions with such parameters, we can infer that the function might return some kind of result derived from `r` and `c`. However, since no specific return cases are provided, we'll focus on the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c`. `h` and `w` are integers within the range of 1 to \(10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers each within the range of 0 to `w`, and `c` is a list of `w` integers each within the range of 0 to `h`.**
