The code snippet `base[j][i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the element in the `j`-th row and `i`-th column of the `base` list. However, the initial state does not provide the exact structure of `base` or the value of `j`. Since `i` is explicitly given as `1`, we know that the first column (index 0) of the `j`-th row is being modified.

Given the precondition that `c` must have at least two elements, `i` is `1`, and `ci` must be greater than `0`, the only variable directly affected by the code is `base[j][i]`. Since `i` is `1`, `base[j][1]` is set to `1`. The values of `c` and `ci` remain unchanged because they are not referenced in the code.

Output State: **`c` must have at least two elements, `i` is 1, `base[j][1]` is 1**
