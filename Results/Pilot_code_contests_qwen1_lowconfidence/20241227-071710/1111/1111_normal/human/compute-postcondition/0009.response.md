According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. The loop continues as long as `args` is not empty.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3
- `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3
- `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ r_i ≤ w for each 1 ≤ i ≤ h
- `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ c_j ≤ h for each 1 ≤ j ≤ w
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`
- `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`
- `at_start` is `False`
- `args` is a non-empty list
- `file` now contains the string representation of `x` (i.e., `file.write(str(x))` has been executed)

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still be a non-empty list.

State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3; `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3; `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ r_i ≤ `w` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ `h`; `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ c_j ≤ `h` for each 1 ≤ j ≤ `w`; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`; `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout); `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a non-empty list; `file` now contains the string representation of the next element in `args`**
