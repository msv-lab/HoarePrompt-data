Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `h` is greater than 0
   - The condition inside the loop is: if `r[i]` is less than `w` and `base[i][r[i]]` equals 1, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

2. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = h-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be less than `h`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2.

4. **Condition for the Loop to Continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < h`.
   - Given that `h` is greater than 0, `i` being 2 means that `2 < h` must hold true.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `h` remains greater than 0.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `h` must be greater than 0**
