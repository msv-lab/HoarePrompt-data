The code `base[j][i] = 1` updates the value of `base[j][i]` to 1. Given that `j` is 1 from the previous state, this means `base[1][0]` is set to 1. The other variables (`c`, `i`, `ci`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `c` must have at least one element.
- `i` is 0.
- `ci` must be greater than 0.
- `base[1][0]` is 1.

Output State: **`c` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `ci` must be greater than 0, `base[1][0]` is 1**
