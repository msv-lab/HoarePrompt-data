The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly defined in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints provided, the function seems to operate on the following inputs:

- `h` is an integer such that `1 <= h <= 10^3`.
- `w` is an integer such that `1 <= w <= 10^3`.
- `r` is a list of `h` integers where `0 <= r[i] <= w` for each `0 <= i < h`.
- `c` is a list of `w` integers where `0 <= c[j] <= h` for each `0 <= j < w`.

Given that all possible return cases are described as "None", the function does not return any meaningful value under any condition.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c` with specific constraints and returns `None`.**
