Output State: **`i` is equal to `w`, `h` must be a non-negative integer within the range `[0, w-1]`, and for all `j` where `0 <= j < w`, either `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` starts at `h`.
   - `h` is a non-negative integer.
   - For all `j` where `0 <= j < h`, either `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for i in range(w):
       if c[i] < h and base[c[i]][i] == 1:
           func_2(0)
           return
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `w-1`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `c[i] < h` and `base[c[i]][i] == 1`.
   - If both conditions are met, the function `func_2(0)` is called and the loop returns immediately.

4. **Conditions After Loop Completion**:
   - If the loop completes without returning, this means none of the conditions `c[i] < h and base[c[i]][i] == 1` were satisfied for any `i` in the range `[0, w-1]`.
   - Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `w` because the loop will have iterated through all possible values of `i` from `0` to `w-1`.

5. **Variable Values and Relationships**:
   - Since the loop did not return early, the only variable affected by the loop is `i`, which becomes `w`.
   - The other variables `h`, `r`, and `base` retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state of the variables is as described in the output state.
