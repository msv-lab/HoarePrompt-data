The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. Since `sep` is popped from `kwargs` with a default value of `' '`, it remains unchanged. The value of `file` is updated to include the string representation of `sep`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3; `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3; `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ r_i ≤ `w` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ `h`; `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ c_j ≤ `h` for each 1 ≤ j ≤ `w`; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`; `file` now contains the string representation of `sep`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a non-empty list**
