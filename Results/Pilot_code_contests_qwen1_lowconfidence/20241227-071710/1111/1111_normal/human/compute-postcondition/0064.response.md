The function `func_2(0)` is called with the argument `0`. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Since no specific changes to variables `i` or `h` are made within the given code snippet, and assuming `func_2` does not modify these variables (as there is no indication otherwise), the values of `i` and `h` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` must be greater than 0**
