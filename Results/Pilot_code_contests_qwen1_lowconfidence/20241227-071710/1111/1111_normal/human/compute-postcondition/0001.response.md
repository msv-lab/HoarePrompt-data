The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` is removing the `'sep'` and `'file'` keys from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigning their values to `sep` and `file` respectively. If the keys are not present in `kwargs`, they default to `' '` and `sys.stdout` respectively. However, the values of `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3; `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3; `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for each 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `h`; `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for each 1 ≤ `j` ≤ `w`; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`**
