Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `c` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ci` must be greater than 0.
   - `base[j][i]` is 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(ci):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = ci - 1`.
   - Since `base[j][i]` is 1, it implies that the current value of `j` (which is 0) is valid for the condition `base[j][i] == 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment from 0 to 1.
   - Therefore, `j` should now be 1.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `c` still must have at least one element.
   - `i` remains 0 since it is not affected by the outer loop.
   - `ci` must still be greater than 0.
   - `base[j][i]` must be 1 for `j = 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `c` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `ci` must be greater than 0, `base[1][0]` is 1**
