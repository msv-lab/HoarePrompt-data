`n` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `w`, `h` must be a non-negative integer within the range `[0, w-1]`, and for all `j` where `0 <= j < w`, either `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1; `n` is equal to `0`.
