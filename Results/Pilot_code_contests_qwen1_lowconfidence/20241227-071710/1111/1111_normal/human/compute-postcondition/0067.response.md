Output State: **`i` is `h`, `h` is a non-negative integer, and for all `j` where `0 <= j < h`, either `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[j][r[j]]` is not equal to 1.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = h - 1`. For each iteration, the loop checks if `r[i] < w` and `base[i][r[i]] == 1`. If both conditions are met, the function `func_2(0)` is called, and the loop returns immediately without incrementing `i`.
2. **No Change in Variables**: If the conditions are not met, the loop simply increments `i` without changing any other variables.
3. **Final State**: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `i` reaches `h`), the value of `i` will be `h`. This means that the loop has checked all indices from `0` to `h-1`. For each index `j` where `0 <= j < h`, the condition `r[j] < w` and `base[j][r[j]] == 1` was either false or the loop did not reach that index because the function returned early.
4. **No Changes to Other Variables**: The variables `r` and `base` do not change unless the function `func_2(0)` is called, which does not modify them. Therefore, the values of `r` and `base` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Since the loop does not alter the values of `r` and `base` in the absence of the function call, the final state of these variables depends only on whether the conditions `r[j] < w` and `base[j][r[j]] == 1` were met for each `j` during the loop execution.
