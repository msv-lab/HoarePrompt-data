According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `h` is 1, and `w` is greater than 1. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2.

Additionally, `n` is defined as the number of times the condition `r[i] < j and c[j] < i` was true for all `j` where `1 <= j < w`, and for all `j` where `0 <= j < w`, `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1. This condition does not change based on the value of `i` directly but is a result of previous iterations.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `h` is 1, `w` is greater than 1**
