Postcondition: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for each \(1 \leq j \leq w\), `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` now contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, and the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`**.
