According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `ci`. The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = ci - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `ci` must be greater than 0, and `base[1][0]` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `ci`.

Since `i` is 0 and the loop runs based on `j`, we need to ensure that `j` increases by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `ci`, meaning `ci` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`c` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `ci` must be greater than 1, `base[1][0]` is 1**
