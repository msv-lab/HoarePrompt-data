According to the given for loop statement, the loop will iterate over each element in the `args` list. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments step-by-step:

1. **Variables `h` and `w`:**
   - These variables define the size constraints for the lists `r` and `c`, but they do not directly affect whether the loop can execute.

2. **List `r`:**
   - This list contains `h` integers, each ranging from 0 to `w`. Its presence is not directly related to the loop executing over `args`.

3. **List `c`:**
   - Similarly, this list contains `w` integers, each ranging from 0 to `h`. Its presence is not directly related to the loop executing over `args`.

4. **Variables `sep`, `file`, `at_start`:**
   - These variables are part of the `kwargs` handling and do not affect the loop execution over `args`.

5. **Variable `args`:**
   - The loop will execute if `args` is a non-empty list (contains at least one element).

Given these points, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `args` is a non-empty list.

State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3; `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3; `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for each 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `h`; `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for each 1 ≤ `j` ≤ `w`; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout); `at_start` is True; `args` is a non-empty list**
