Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 1
- `h` is 1
- `w` is 1
- `n` is 0
- For all `j` where `0 <= j < w`, either `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `for j in range(1, w)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Range**: The loop runs for `j` from 1 to `w-1`.
   - Given that `w` is 1, the loop range becomes `range(1, 1)`, which means there are no values for `j` in this range.

2. **Loop Execution**: Since the loop range is empty (because `w` is 1), the loop will not execute even once.

3. **Adjusting States**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `w` is greater than 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` is 1 (unchanged)
- `h` is 1 (unchanged)
- `w` must be greater than 1 (to ensure the loop range is not empty)
- `n` is 0 (unchanged)
- For all `j` where `0 <= j < w`, either `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1 (unchanged)

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `h` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1, `n` is 0, and for all `j` where `0 <= j < w`, either `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1**
