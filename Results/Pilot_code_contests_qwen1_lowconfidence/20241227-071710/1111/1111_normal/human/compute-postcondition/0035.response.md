The code assigns the value `1` to `base[j][i]`. However, the initial values of `j` and `i` are not specified. Given that `i` is initially `0`, the code updates `base[j][0]` to `1`. Since the precondition specifies that `base[1][0]` is `1`, it implies that `j` could be `1`. But without a specific value for `j`, we can only say that `base[j][0]` is now `1`.

Output State: **`c` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `ci` must be greater than 1, `base[j][0]` is 1**
