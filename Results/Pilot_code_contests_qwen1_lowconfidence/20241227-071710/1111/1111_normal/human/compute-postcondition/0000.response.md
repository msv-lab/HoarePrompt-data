The provided code snippet does not actually perform any operations or assignments. It only contains a docstring that describes what a function might do (print values to a stream or to `sys.stdout` by default). Therefore, no variables are modified, and the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3; `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3; `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for each 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `h`; `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for each 1 ≤ `j` ≤ `w`.**
