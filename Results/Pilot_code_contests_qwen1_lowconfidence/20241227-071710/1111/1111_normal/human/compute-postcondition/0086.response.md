According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `w` (exclusive). This means that for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `w`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `i` is 1
- `h` is 1
- `w` must be greater than 1
- `n` is 0
- `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1 for all `j` where `0 <= j < w`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value (which was `w-1` at the end of the last iteration).

Let's assume `w` is initially set to some value greater than 1, say `w = 3` (this is inferred since it must be greater than 1 and we need to consider the next possible value for `j`).

- After the previous iteration, `j` would have been 2 because the loop runs from 1 to `w-1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be 3.

So, we need to update the state such that `j` is now 3 and all other conditions remain the same.

State: **`i` is 1, `h` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1, `n` is 0, `r[j]` is not less than `w` or `base[r[j]][j]` is not equal to 1 for all `j` where `0 <= j < 3`.**
