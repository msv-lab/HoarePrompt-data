`at_start` is set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3; `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3; `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for each 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `h`; `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for each 1 ≤ `j` ≤ `w`; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout); `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a non-empty list; `file` now contains the string representation of `x` (i.e., `file.write(str(x))` has been executed).
