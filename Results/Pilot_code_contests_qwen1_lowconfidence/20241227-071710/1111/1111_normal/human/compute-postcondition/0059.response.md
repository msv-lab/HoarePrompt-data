Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `h` is greater than 0.
   - Either `r[i]` is not less than `w` or `base[i][r[i]]` is not equal to 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < h`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop condition `i < h` must hold true for the loop to continue.
   - Given that `h` is greater than 0, `i = 0` satisfies the condition `i < h`.

4. **Incrementing `i`**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **New State Requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time (i.e., for `i` to be 1), `h` must still be greater than 0.
   - Additionally, the loop body might modify other variables, but based on the given conditions, no other specific changes are mentioned. Thus, we assume the only relevant state to adjust is `i`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - `i` needs to be 1.
   - `h` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `h` is greater than 0**
