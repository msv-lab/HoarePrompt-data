The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object associated with `file`. Since `at_start` is `False`, `file.write(sep)` has already been executed before this line. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so it will remain as `x` in the output state. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3; `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3; `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `w` for each 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `h`; `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ `c_j` ≤ `h` for each 1 ≤ `j` ≤ `w`; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` and `file` is the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout); `at_start` is False; `args` is a non-empty list; `file` now contains the string representation of `x` (i.e., `file.write(str(x))` has been executed).**
