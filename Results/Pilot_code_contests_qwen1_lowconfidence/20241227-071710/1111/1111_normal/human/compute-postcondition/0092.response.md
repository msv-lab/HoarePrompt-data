Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- State before the for loop starts: `i` is 2, `h` is 1, `w` is greater than 1.
- For loop: `for j in range(1, w):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `j` ranges from 1 to `w-1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `j` satisfies `1 <= j < w`.

2. **Determine the Minimum Value of `w`:**
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `w-1`, the smallest value of `w` for which the loop can execute is 2 (since if `w` is 1, the range would be `range(1, 1)`, which is empty).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `w` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. Currently, `w` is stated to be "greater than 1", but we need to explicitly state that it must be at least 2 to ensure the loop body runs.
   - The values of `i` and `h` are not directly relevant to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2
- `h` is 1
- `w` must be at least 2 (i.e., `w >= 2`)

**State: **`i` is 2, `h` is 1, `w` must be at least 2**
