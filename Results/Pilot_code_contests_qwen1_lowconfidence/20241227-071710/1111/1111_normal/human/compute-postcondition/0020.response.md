The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`. The value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is either explicitly provided in `kwargs` or defaults to a newline character `\n` if not specified. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\)
- `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\)
- `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq h\)
- `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for each \(1 \leq j \leq w\)
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`
- `file` now contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`
- `at_start` is `False`
- `args` is an empty list

After executing the code:
- The value of `file` will have the content of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` appended to it.
- The value of `kwargs` will be updated by removing the key `'end'`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for each \(1 \leq j \leq w\), `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` now contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`**.
