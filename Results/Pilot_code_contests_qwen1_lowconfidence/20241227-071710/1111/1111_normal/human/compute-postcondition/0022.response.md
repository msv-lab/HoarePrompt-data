The code `file.flush()` is called, which flushes the file buffer, ensuring that all pending buffered data is written to the file. This operation does not change the values of any variables other than potentially writing the content of `file` to the underlying file. Since no direct assignment or modification to any variable occurs within this line of code, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\), `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\), `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq h\), `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for each \(1 \leq j \leq w\), `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, `file` now contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, `at_start` is `False`, `args` is an empty list, `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, and the value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`. The file buffer has been flushed.**
