According to the code, the loop condition for `j` is `range(1, w)`. This means the loop will iterate from `1` to `w-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `h` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1, and `n` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been `1` because it starts from `1` and increments by default (though the increment is not shown explicitly).

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `w` must be greater than `1` and `j` must be `2`.

Given that `n` is already defined and does not change within the loop, we only need to adjust `j` and `w`.

State: **`i` is 2, `h` is 1, `w` must be greater than 2, `n` is 2**
