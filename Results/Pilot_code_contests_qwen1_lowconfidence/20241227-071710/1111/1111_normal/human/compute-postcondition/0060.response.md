The function `func_2(0)` is called, but since the definition of `func_2` is not provided, no specific changes to the variables are known. The only information given is that `i` is 1 and `h` is greater than 0. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `h` is greater than 0**
