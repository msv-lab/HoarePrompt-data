The function `func_2(0)` is called with an argument of `0`. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so no changes are made to the variables `i`, `h`, `w`, `c`, or `base`. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `h + 1`, `h + 1` must be within the range `[0, w-1]`, `c[i]` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, or `base[c[i]][i]` is not equal to `1`**
