According to the given for loop, the loop will iterate over the elements of the list `c` using the `enumerate` function. The variable `ci` will hold each element of the list `c` in sequence.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. The list `c` must contain at least one element because `enumerate` will start from index 0.
2. The variable `i` will start from 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial states:
- `h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\)
- `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\)
- `c` is a list of integers
- `r` is a list of integers where each element is between 0 and `w`
- `base` is a `h` by `w` matrix where the element `base[i][j]` is 1 if and only if there exists some `k` (where \(0 \leq k < h\)) and `l` (where \(0 \leq l < r[k]\)) such that `i == k` and `j == l`

We need to adjust the states as follows:
- Ensure `c` is not empty (it must contain at least one element).
- Set `i` to 0, as the loop will start from the first element of the list `c`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`c` must have at least one element, `i` is 0**
