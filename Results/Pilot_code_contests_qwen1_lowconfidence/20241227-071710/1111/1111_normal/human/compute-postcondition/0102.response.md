Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `h` is 1
   - `w` must be greater than 1
   - `n` is greater than 0 and is incremented by 1 if `r[2] < j` and `c[j] < 2` are both true

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, w):`
   - This means `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `w-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is currently 1 (since the loop just started).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, the condition `j < w` must hold true.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - `j` needs to be set to 2.
   - `w` must still be greater than 1.
   - `n` will be incremented by 1 if the conditions `r[2] < j` and `c[j] < 2` are both true. Since `j` is now 2, we need to check these conditions.

6. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` remains unchanged at 2.
   - `h` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `w` must be greater than 1.
   - `n` will be incremented by 1 if `r[2] < 2` and `c[2] < 2` are both true.

So, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

**State: **`i` is 2, `h` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1, `n` will be incremented by 1 if `r[2] < 2` and `c[2] < 2` are both true**
