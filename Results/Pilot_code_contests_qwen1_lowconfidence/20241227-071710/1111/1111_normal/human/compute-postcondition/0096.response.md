Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `h` is 1
   - `w` must be at least 2
   - `n` is `r[2] < 2 and c[2] < 2 + (r[i] < j and c[j] < i)`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, w):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `j` values from 1 to `w-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so the condition `r[i] < j` translates to `r[2] < j`.

4. **Current Values and Conditions:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `h` is 1 (this variable does not directly affect the loop condition)
   - `w` must be at least 2
   - `n` is `r[2] < 2 and c[2] < 2 + (r[2] < j and c[j] < 2)` (this is used to determine if the loop should continue)

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from its previous value.
   - Let's assume `j` was at the maximum value it could be in the previous iteration. Since `j` ranges from 1 to `w-1`, the next value `j` would take is `w`.

6. **New States:**
   - `i` remains 2
   - `h` remains 1
   - `w` remains at least 2
   - `n` needs to be recalculated with `j = w`:
     - `r[2] < j` becomes `r[2] < w`
     - `c[2] < 2 + (r[2] < w and c[w] < 2)`

Given the above analysis:

**State: **`i` is 2, `h` is 1, `w` must be at least 2, `n` is `r[2] < w and c[2] < 2 + (r[2] < w and c[w] < 2)`**
