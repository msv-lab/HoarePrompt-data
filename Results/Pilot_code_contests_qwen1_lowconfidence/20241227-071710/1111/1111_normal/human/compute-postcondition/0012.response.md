The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `file` already contains the string representation of `sep` and `at_start` is `False`, this operation appends the string representation of `x` to `file` followed by `sep`.

- `h` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3.
- `w` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3.
- `r` remains a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ r_i ≤ `w` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ `h`.
- `c` remains a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ c_j ≤ `h` for each 1 ≤ j ≤ `w`.
- `sep` remains the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`.
- `file` now contains the string representation of `sep` followed by the string representation of `x`.
- `at_start` remains `False`.
- `args` remains a non-empty list.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^3; `w` is an integer such that 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^3; `r` is a list of `h` integers where 0 ≤ r_i ≤ `w` for each 1 ≤ i ≤ `h`; `c` is a list of `w` integers where 0 ≤ c_j ≤ `h` for each 1 ≤ j ≤ `w`; `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`; `file` now contains the string representation of `sep` followed by the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a non-empty list.**
