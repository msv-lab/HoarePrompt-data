Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 10^3\); `w` is an integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 10^3\); `r` is a list of `h` integers where \(0 \leq r_i \leq w\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq h\); `c` is a list of `w` integers where \(0 \leq c_j \leq h\) for each \(1 \leq j \leq w\); `sep` is the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`; `file` now contains the string representation of `sep` followed by the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a non-empty list.***
