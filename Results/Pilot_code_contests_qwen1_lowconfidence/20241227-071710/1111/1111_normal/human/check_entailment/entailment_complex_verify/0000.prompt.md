You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Suppose there is a h × w grid consisting of empty or full cells. Let's make some definitions:

  * r_{i} is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the left side in the i-th row (1 ≤ i ≤ h). In particular, r_i=0 if the leftmost cell of the i-th row is empty. 
  * c_{j} is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the top end in the j-th column (1 ≤ j ≤ w). In particular, c_j=0 if the topmost cell of the j-th column is empty. 



In other words, the i-th row starts exactly with r_i full cells. Similarly, the j-th column starts exactly with c_j full cells.

<image> These are the r and c values of some 3 × 4 grid. Black cells are full and white cells are empty.

You have values of r and c. Initially, all cells are empty. Find the number of ways to fill grid cells to satisfy values of r and c. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^{9} + 7). In other words, find the remainder after division of the answer by 1000000007 (10^{9} + 7).

Input

The first line contains two integers h and w (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 10^{3}) — the height and width of the grid.

The second line contains h integers r_{1}, r_{2}, …, r_{h} (0 ≤ r_{i} ≤ w) — the values of r.

The third line contains w integers c_{1}, c_{2}, …, c_{w} (0 ≤ c_{j} ≤ h) — the values of c.

Output

Print the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^{9} + 7).

Note

In the second example, it's impossible to make a grid to satisfy such r, c values.

        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic required to satisfy both `r` and `c` values simultaneously. Specifically, the function `func_2` is called without proper logic to ensure that the grid satisfies both conditions. Here is a detailed explanation:

1. **Grid Initialization**: The grid initialization part is correct. It sets up the grid based on the `r` and `c` values, ensuring that the first `r_i` cells in each row and the first `c_j` cells in each column are filled.

2. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks if the grid can satisfy the `r` and `c` values by verifying if the conditions hold true. However, it does not properly handle cases where the grid cannot be filled correctly due to conflicting `r` and `c` values.

3. **Counting Valid Configurations**: The logic to count valid configurations using `n` (the number of cells where both `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` holds) is flawed. This logic only counts cells where both conditions are satisfied but does not ensure that the entire grid can be filled correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- **Input**:
  ```
  3 4
  0 3 1
  0 2 3 0
  ```

- **Expected Output**: 
  The expected output should be `2` because there are two valid ways to fill the grid to satisfy the `r` and `c` values. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Here is a revised approach that could work:

```python
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase

def func_1():
    (h, w) = map(int, input().split())
    r = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    c = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    
    # Initialize the grid
    base = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    for (i, ri) in enumerate(r):
        for j in range(ri):
            base[i][j] = 1
    for (i, ci) in enumerate(c):
        for j in range(ci):
            base[j][i] = 1
    
    # Check if the grid can be filled correctly
    for i in range(h):
        if r[i] < w and base[i][r[i]] == 1:
            print(0)
            return
    for i in range(w):
        if c[i] < h and base[c[i]][i] == 1:
            print(0)
            return
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining cells
    n = 0
    for i in range(1, h):
        for j in range(1, w):
            n += r[i] < j and c[j] < i
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining cells
    result = pow(2, n, 1000000007)
    print(result)

# Driver Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the grid can be filled correctly and handles the counting logic properly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c`. It constructs a `h` by `w` matrix called `base` where `base[i][j]` is 1 if and only if `i < r[j]` or `j < c[i]`. After constructing the matrix, it checks for certain conditions and calls `func_2` with the appropriate argument if these conditions are met. If no conditions are met, it calculates the value of `n` as the count of valid pairs `(j, i)` where `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i`, and then calls `func_2` with `2^n mod 1000000007`. Finally, the function returns `None`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `h` or `w` is 1, the matrix `base` will be very small, and the conditions checked in the loops will be simpler.
- If `r` or `c` contains values that exceed the dimensions of the matrix, the function still constructs the matrix correctly, but the conditions will not be evaluated for those out-of-bounds indices.
- If both `r` and `c` are empty lists, the matrix `base` will remain empty, and the function will return `None` without calling `func_2`.

Missing functionality includes:
- There are no explicit error checks for invalid input values or types, which could lead to runtime errors if the input does not conform to the specified constraints.
- The function does not handle the case where `h` or `w` is 0, which would result in an empty matrix and potentially unexpected behavior in subsequent checks.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints these arguments to a specified file stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) with a specified separator (`sep`, defaulting to a space) and an end character (`end`, defaulting to a newline). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, it flushes the file buffer. The function does not modify the input parameters `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c`, which are mentioned in the initial comment but not used in the actual code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the file buffer is flushed.
