Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the given `r` and `c` values are valid for constructing a grid. Specifically, the program does not properly verify the constraints and does not handle the cases where it is impossible to construct a grid that satisfies the given `r` and `c` values.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1 1
0
1
```

According to the problem description, the grid should be a 1x1 grid. The `r` value is 0, which means the first row should start with 0 full cells, and the `c` value is 1, which means the first column should start with 1 full cell. This is impossible since the only cell in the grid is required to be full, but `r` specifies it should be empty. Therefore, the output should be 0.

However, the provided program does not check this condition and will incorrectly output a non-zero value.

To fix this, the program needs to include validation checks to ensure that the given `r` and `c` values are consistent and feasible.
