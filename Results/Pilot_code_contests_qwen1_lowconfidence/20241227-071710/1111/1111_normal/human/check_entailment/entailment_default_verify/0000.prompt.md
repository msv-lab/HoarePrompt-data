You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Suppose there is a h × w grid consisting of empty or full cells. Let's make some definitions:

  * r_{i} is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the left side in the i-th row (1 ≤ i ≤ h). In particular, r_i=0 if the leftmost cell of the i-th row is empty. 
  * c_{j} is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the top end in the j-th column (1 ≤ j ≤ w). In particular, c_j=0 if the topmost cell of the j-th column is empty. 



In other words, the i-th row starts exactly with r_i full cells. Similarly, the j-th column starts exactly with c_j full cells.

<image> These are the r and c values of some 3 × 4 grid. Black cells are full and white cells are empty.

You have values of r and c. Initially, all cells are empty. Find the number of ways to fill grid cells to satisfy values of r and c. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^{9} + 7). In other words, find the remainder after division of the answer by 1000000007 (10^{9} + 7).

Input

The first line contains two integers h and w (1 ≤ h, w ≤ 10^{3}) — the height and width of the grid.

The second line contains h integers r_{1}, r_{2}, …, r_{h} (0 ≤ r_{i} ≤ w) — the values of r.

The third line contains w integers c_{1}, c_{2}, …, c_{w} (0 ≤ c_{j} ≤ h) — the values of c.

Output

Print the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^{9} + 7).

In the second example, it's impossible to make a grid to satisfy such r, c values.

Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (h, w) = map(int, input().split())
    r = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    c = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    base = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    for (i, ri) in enumerate(r):
        for j in range(ri):
            base[i][j] = 1
    for (i, ci) in enumerate(c):
        for j in range(ci):
            base[j][i] = 1
    for i in range(h):
        if r[i] < w and base[i][r[i]] == 1:
            func_2(0)
            return
    for i in range(w):
        if c[i] < h and base[c[i]][i] == 1:
            func_2(0)
            return
    n = 0
    for i in range(1, h):
        for j in range(1, w):
            n += r[i] < j and c[j] < i
    func_2(pow(2, n, 1000000007))

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic required to satisfy both `r` and `c` values simultaneously. Specifically, the function `func_2` is called without proper logic to ensure that the grid satisfies both conditions. Here is a detailed explanation:

1. **Grid Initialization**: The grid initialization part is correct. It sets up the grid based on the `r` and `c` values, ensuring that the first `r_i` cells in each row and the first `c_j` cells in each column are filled.

2. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks if the grid can satisfy the `r` and `c` values by verifying if the conditions hold true. However, it does not properly handle cases where the grid cannot be filled correctly due to conflicting `r` and `c` values.

3. **Counting Valid Configurations**: The logic to count valid configurations using `n` (the number of cells where both `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` holds) is flawed. This logic only counts cells where both conditions are satisfied but does not ensure that the entire grid can be filled correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- **Input**:
  ```
  3 4
  0 3 1
  0 2 3 0
  ```

- **Expected Output**: 
  The expected output should be `2` because there are two valid ways to fill the grid to satisfy the `r` and `c` values. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Here is a revised approach that could work:

```python
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase

def func_1():
    (h, w) = map(int, input().split())
    r = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    c = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    
    # Initialize the grid
    base = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    for (i, ri) in enumerate(r):
        for j in range(ri):
            base[i][j] = 1
    for (i, ci) in enumerate(c):
        for j in range(ci):
            base[j][i] = 1
    
    # Check if the grid can be filled correctly
    for i in range(h):
        if r[i] < w and base[i][r[i]] == 1:
            print(0)
            return
    for i in range(w):
        if c[i] < h and base[c[i]][i] == 1:
            print(0)
            return
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining cells
    n = 0
    for i in range(1, h):
        for j in range(1, w):
            n += r[i] < j and c[j] < i
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining cells
    result = pow(2, n, 1000000007)
    print(result)

# Driver Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the grid can be filled correctly and handles the counting logic properly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2()` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints these arguments to a specified file stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`) with a specified separator (`sep`, defaulting to a space) and an end character (`end`, defaulting to a newline). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, it flushes the file buffer. The function does not modify the input parameters `h`, `w`, `r`, and `c`, which are mentioned in the initial comment but not used in the actual code. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `file` contains the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the file buffer is flushed.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
