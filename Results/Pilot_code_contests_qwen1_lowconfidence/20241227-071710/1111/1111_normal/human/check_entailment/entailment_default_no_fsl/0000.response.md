Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code constructs a base matrix based on the given `r` and `c` values but does not correctly handle the conditions for filling the grid to satisfy both `r` and `c` simultaneously. Here are the key issues:

1. **Matrix Construction**: The matrix `base` is constructed based on the `r` and `c` values, but this construction alone does not ensure that the grid can be filled to satisfy both `r` and `c` simultaneously. The code does not check for consistency between `r` and `c` values.

2. **Condition Checks**: The code checks if certain conditions are met and calls `func_2` with `0` if they are, but this does not handle the case where the grid can be filled correctly. Instead, it should count the number of valid ways to fill the grid based on the `r` and `c` values.

3. **Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The calculation of `n` as the count of valid pairs `(j, i)` where `r[i] < j` and `c[j] < i` is not sufficient to determine the number of ways to fill the grid. This calculation only considers a subset of the necessary conditions.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The final call to `func_2` with `2^n mod 1000000007` is not the correct way to compute the number of ways to fill the grid. The number of ways should be calculated based on the dynamic programming approach or another method that ensures the grid can be filled according to both `r` and `c`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
