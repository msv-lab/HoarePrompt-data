Output State: **`args` is an empty list, `at_start` is `False`, the file contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
- If `at_start` is `False`, it writes `sep` to the file before writing the string representation of `x`.
- After each iteration, `at_start` is set to `False`, ensuring that `sep` is only written the first time.
- Once all elements in `args` are processed, `args` becomes an empty list.
- The file contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, with each element followed by `sep` (except the last one).

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `args` is an empty list initially), `at_start` will still be `False` because the loop never sets it to `True` after the first write operation. The file will remain unchanged as no elements are written to it.
