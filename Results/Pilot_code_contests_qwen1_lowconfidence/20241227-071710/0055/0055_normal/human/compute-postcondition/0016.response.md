Postcondition: ***`args` must have at least one element left, `at_start` is `True`, `x` is the next element in `args`, and the file contains the string representation of `x` appended to its previous contents. If the condition `not at_start` is true, the file now also contains the string representation of `sep` appended to its previous contents.***
