The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `k`: an integer representing the initial number of lines in the file.
- `n`: a positive integer representing the length of Monocarp's sequence of actions.
- `m`: a positive integer representing the length of Polycarp's sequence of actions.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers, where each element can either be 0 or a positive integer not exceeding 300.
- `b`: a list of `m` integers, where each element can either be 0 or a positive integer not exceeding 300.

The function returns an unspecified value based on the provided conditions, but no specific return values or cases are given directly in the problem statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `k`, two positive integers `n` and `m`, and two lists `a` and `b` with specified constraints, and perform some operation based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `k`, two positive integers `n` and `m`, and two lists `a` and `b` with specified constraints, and performs some operation based on these inputs.**
