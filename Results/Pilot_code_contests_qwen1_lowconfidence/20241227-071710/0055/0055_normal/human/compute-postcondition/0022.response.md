The code `file.flush()` is called, which flushes the internal buffer of the file. This means that any buffered data in the file's buffer will be written to the file. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `args`, `at_start`, or `kwargs.pop('flush', False)`. The value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is explicitly mentioned to be `True`, so it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is an empty list, `at_start` is `False`, the file now contains the previous contents plus the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` appended to it, `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`**
