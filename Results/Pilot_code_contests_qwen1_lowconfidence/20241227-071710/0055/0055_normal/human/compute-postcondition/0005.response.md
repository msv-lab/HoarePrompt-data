`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the code does not assign a value to `sep` or modify any existing variables. The only thing affected is the file, which now contains `sep`. The variables `args` and `at_start` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element; `at_start` is `False`**
