`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file, but it does not affect the values of the variables `args` or `at_start`. The value of `x` itself is converted to a string and written to the file, but its value in memory remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the content of the file.

Output State: **`args` must have at least two elements, `at_start` remains `False`, `x` remains the same value, and the file contains the string representation of `x` appended to its previous contents.**
