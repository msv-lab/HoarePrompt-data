The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. The other variables (`args`, `x`, and the file's content) remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element left, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the next element in `args`, and the file contains the string representation of `x` appended to its previous contents.**
