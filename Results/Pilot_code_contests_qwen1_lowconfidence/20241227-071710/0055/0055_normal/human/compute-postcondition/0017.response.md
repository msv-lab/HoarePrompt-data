`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not change the value of `x`, `at_start`, or the contents of `args`. However, it does modify the file by appending the string representation of `x` to its current contents.

Since `at_start` is `True`, writing to the file will not prepend anything (no `sep` will be added). The precondition that `args` must have at least one element left is maintained, and the state of `args` remains unchanged because no elements are removed or modified by this operation.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element left, `at_start` is `True`, `x` is the next element in `args`, and the file contains the string representation of `x` appended to its previous contents.**
