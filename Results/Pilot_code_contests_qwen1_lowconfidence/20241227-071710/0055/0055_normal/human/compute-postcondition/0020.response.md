The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` performs the following actions:
- `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` retrieves the value associated with the key `'end'` from the dictionary `kwargs`. If the key does not exist, it defaults to `\n`.
- The retrieved value (which could be `\n` or any other value from `kwargs`) is written to the file using `file.write`.

Since the initial state specifies that `args` is an empty list, `at_start` is `False`, and the file contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, there is no immediate impact on these variables.

However, the line of code does affect the state of the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the `'end'` key (if it exists) and writing its value to the file.

Output State: **`args` is an empty list, `at_start` is `False`, the file now contains the previous contents plus the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` appended to it.**
