According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. For the loop to execute again, `args` must have at least two elements because the loop iterates over each element in `args`, starting from the first element.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `args` must have at least one element.
- `at_start` is `False`.

Since the loop is iterating over `args` and `at_start` is `False`, it means that the loop has already processed at least one element. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `args` must have at least two elements.

State: **`args` must have at least two elements, `at_start` is `False`**
