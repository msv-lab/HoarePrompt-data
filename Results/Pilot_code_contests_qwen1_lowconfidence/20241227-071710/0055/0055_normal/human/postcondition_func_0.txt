The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes three non-negative integers `k`, `n`, and `m`, along with two arrays `a` and `b`. However, the provided code snippet does not contain any implementation logic, meaning it currently does not perform any specific actions or return any values based on the inputs. Therefore, the function does not have any defined behavior or output for the given inputs, and the state of the program remains unchanged after the function call.
