Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality to generate a valid sequence of actions for Monocarp and Polycarp. The program contains placeholder functions `func_1` and `func_2`, which do not contribute to solving the problem. The main function is missing, and even if we were to write the main logic, the current structure does not handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Initial number of lines \( k = 3 \)
- Monocarp's actions: \( a = [2, 0] \)
- Polycarp's actions: \( b = [0, 5] \)

A valid sequence of actions could be `[2, 0, 0, 5]` or `[0, 2, 0, 5]`. However, the provided program does not attempt to generate such sequences or even define the logic to do so. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements and is thus incorrect.
