Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program does not implement the required functionality to generate a correct common sequence of actions for Monocarp and Polycarp. The provided `func_2` function simply prints `-1` for all test cases without attempting to construct a valid sequence, as demonstrated in the analysis of the specific test cases. The output hints further confirm that the function does not perform the necessary logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
