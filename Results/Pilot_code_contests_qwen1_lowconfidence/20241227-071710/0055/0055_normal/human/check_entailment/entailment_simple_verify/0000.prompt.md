You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Monocarp and Polycarp are learning new programming techniques. Now they decided to try pair programming.

It's known that they have worked together on the same file for n + m minutes. Every minute exactly one of them made one change to the file. Before they started, there were already k lines written in the file.

Every minute exactly one of them does one of two actions: adds a new line to the end of the file or changes one of its lines.

Monocarp worked in total for n minutes and performed the sequence of actions [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]. If a_i = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If a_i > 0, then he changes the line with the number a_i. Monocarp performed actions strictly in this order: a_1, then a_2, ..., a_n.

Polycarp worked in total for m minutes and performed the sequence of actions [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]. If b_j = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If b_j > 0, then he changes the line with the number b_j. Polycarp performed actions strictly in this order: b_1, then b_2, ..., b_m.

Restore their common sequence of actions of length n + m such that all actions would be correct — there should be no changes to lines that do not yet exist. Keep in mind that in the common sequence Monocarp's actions should form the subsequence [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] and Polycarp's — subsequence [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]. They can replace each other at the computer any number of times.

Let's look at an example. Suppose k = 3. Monocarp first changed the line with the number 2 and then added a new line (thus, n = 2, \: a = [2, 0]). Polycarp first added a new line and then changed the line with the number 5 (thus, m = 2, \: b = [0, 5]).

Since the initial length of the file was 3, in order for Polycarp to change line number 5 two new lines must be added beforehand. Examples of correct sequences of changes, in this case, would be [0, 2, 0, 5] and [2, 0, 0, 5]. Changes [0, 0, 5, 2] (wrong order of actions) and [0, 5, 2, 0] (line 5 cannot be edited yet) are not correct.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Then t test cases follow. Before each test case, there is an empty line.

Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains three integers k, n, m (0 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the initial number of lines in file and lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of changes respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 300).

The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (0 ≤ b_j ≤ 300).

Output

For each test case print any correct common sequence of Monocarp's and Polycarp's actions of length n + m or -1 if such sequence doesn't exist.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality to generate a valid sequence of actions for Monocarp and Polycarp. The program contains placeholder functions `func_1` and `func_2`, which do not contribute to solving the problem. The main function is missing, and even if we were to write the main logic, the current structure does not handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Initial number of lines \( k = 3 \)
- Monocarp's actions: \( a = [2, 0] \)
- Polycarp's actions: \( b = [0, 5] \)

A valid sequence of actions could be `[2, 0, 0, 5]` or `[0, 2, 0, 5]`. However, the provided program does not attempt to generate such sequences or even define the logic to do so. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements and is thus incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
