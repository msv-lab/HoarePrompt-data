Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where a change action (either adding a line or changing a line) is attempted before all necessary lines have been added. Specifically, the code allows for changes to lines that do not yet exist, which violates the problem description. For instance, consider the following scenario:

- Initial lines: \( k = 3 \)
- Monocarp's actions: \( n = 2, \: a = [2, 0] \)
- Polycarp's actions: \( m = 2, \: b = [0, 5] \)

Here, Monocarp first changes line 2, and then adds a new line. Polycarp then adds a new line and attempts to change line 5, which requires lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 to exist first. The provided code does not enforce this condition and allows the change to line 5 to proceed, even though lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 are still missing.

This issue can be demonstrated with the example given in the problem description:

- Initial lines: \( k = 3 \)
- Monocarp's actions: \( n = 2, \: a = [2, 0] \)
- Polycarp's actions: \( m = 2, \: b = [0, 5] \)

The correct sequence should ensure that the change to line 5 is preceded by the addition of the necessary lines. The provided code fails to enforce this requirement, making it incorrect.
