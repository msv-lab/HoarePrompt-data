You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Monocarp and Polycarp are learning new programming techniques. Now they decided to try pair programming.

It's known that they have worked together on the same file for n + m minutes. Every minute exactly one of them made one change to the file. Before they started, there were already k lines written in the file.

Every minute exactly one of them does one of two actions: adds a new line to the end of the file or changes one of its lines.

Monocarp worked in total for n minutes and performed the sequence of actions [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]. If a_i = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If a_i > 0, then he changes the line with the number a_i. Monocarp performed actions strictly in this order: a_1, then a_2, ..., a_n.

Polycarp worked in total for m minutes and performed the sequence of actions [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]. If b_j = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If b_j > 0, then he changes the line with the number b_j. Polycarp performed actions strictly in this order: b_1, then b_2, ..., b_m.

Restore their common sequence of actions of length n + m such that all actions would be correct — there should be no changes to lines that do not yet exist. Keep in mind that in the common sequence Monocarp's actions should form the subsequence [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] and Polycarp's — subsequence [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]. They can replace each other at the computer any number of times.

Let's look at an example. Suppose k = 3. Monocarp first changed the line with the number 2 and then added a new line (thus, n = 2, \: a = [2, 0]). Polycarp first added a new line and then changed the line with the number 5 (thus, m = 2, \: b = [0, 5]).

Since the initial length of the file was 3, in order for Polycarp to change line number 5 two new lines must be added beforehand. Examples of correct sequences of changes, in this case, would be [0, 2, 0, 5] and [2, 0, 0, 5]. Changes [0, 0, 5, 2] (wrong order of actions) and [0, 5, 2, 0] (line 5 cannot be edited yet) are not correct.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Then t test cases follow. Before each test case, there is an empty line.

Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains three integers k, n, m (0 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the initial number of lines in file and lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of changes respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 300).

The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (0 ≤ b_j ≤ 300).

Output

For each test case print any correct common sequence of Monocarp's and Polycarp's actions of length n + m or -1 if such sequence doesn't exist.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
