Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality to generate a correct common sequence of actions for Monocarp and Polycarp. Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the following input:
```
3 2 2
2 0
0 5
```

According to the problem description:
- Initially, there are 3 lines in the file.
- Monocarp performs actions `[2, 0]`.
- Polycarp performs actions `[0, 5]`.

A correct common sequence should be `2 0 0 5` because:
1. Monocarp first changes line 2.
2. Polycarp adds a new line (making the file size 4).
3. Monocarp adds another new line (making the file size 5).
4. Polycarp changes line 5.

However, the provided program does not generate this sequence. Instead, it simply prints `-1` for all test cases without attempting to construct a valid sequence.

To confirm this, let's consider another test case:
```
4 3 2
2 0 5
0 6
```

The correct sequence should be `2 0 0 6 5` because:
1. Monocarp changes line 2.
2. Polycarp adds a new line (making the file size 5).
3. Monocarp adds another new line (making the file size 6).
4. Polycarp adds another new line (making the file size 7).
5. Polycarp changes line 6.

Again, the program incorrectly prints `-1`.

Since the program fails to produce the correct output for the given inputs, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
