#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, k, n, and m are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and the arrays a and b consist of non-negative integers not exceeding 300.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes three non-negative integers `k`, `n`, and `m`, along with two arrays `a` and `b`. However, the provided code snippet does not contain any implementation logic, meaning it currently does not perform any specific actions or return any values based on the inputs. Therefore, the function does not have any defined behavior or output for the given inputs, and the state of the program remains unchanged after the function call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer representing the initial number of lines in the file, n and m are positive integers representing the lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of actions respectively, a is a list of n integers representing Monocarp's actions, and b is a list of m integers representing Polycarp's actions. Each element in a and b can either be 0 or a positive integer not exceeding 300.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is an empty list, `at_start` is `False`, the file contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is an empty list, `at_start` is `False`, the file now contains the previous contents plus the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` appended to it. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, then the function flushes the file. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `False`, no additional actions are taken.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes no explicit arguments from the caller (the provided annotations and comments do not correctly reflect its behavior), but rather uses positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the elements of the `args` list to a file object specified by `file` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separated by the string specified by `sep` (defaulting to a single space). After writing the elements, it appends the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the file. The function does not modify the `args` or `at_start` variables and leaves them in their current states. If `args` is an empty list, the function simply writes `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file without any preceding elements. There is a potential edge case where `kwargs` might contain additional keys that are not handled by the function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
