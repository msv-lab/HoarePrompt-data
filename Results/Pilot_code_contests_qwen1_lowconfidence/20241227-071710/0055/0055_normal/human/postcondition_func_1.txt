The function `func_2` takes no explicit arguments from the caller (the provided annotations and comments do not correctly reflect its behavior), but rather uses positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the elements of the `args` list to a file object specified by `file` (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separated by the string specified by `sep` (defaulting to a single space). After writing the elements, it appends the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, it flushes the file. The function does not modify the `args` or `at_start` variables and leaves them in their current states. If `args` is an empty list, the function simply writes `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file without any preceding elements. There is a potential edge case where `kwargs` might contain additional keys that are not handled by the function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
