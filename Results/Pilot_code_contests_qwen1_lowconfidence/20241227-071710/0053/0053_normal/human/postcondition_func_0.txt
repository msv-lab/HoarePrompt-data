The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases, with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of positive integers `a_1,...,a_n` and `b_1,...,b_m`, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 1000\). The function then checks if there is any common element between the sets created from `lst1` and `lst2`. If a common element is found, it prints 'YES' followed by '1' and the common element. If no common elements are found, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any explicit value; instead, it relies on printing the results directly to the console for each test case.
