Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Output Format for Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The problem description requires the program to output "YES" or "NO" for each test case followed by the subsequence if applicable. However, the current implementation outputs the result only once per test case and does not handle multiple test cases correctly.
   - The program reads all inputs at once and processes them sequentially without explicitly handling multiple test cases. It only processes one test case at a time and prints the result for that test case. If there are multiple test cases, the program will not produce the expected output format.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program uses a single loop to process all test cases, but it should use a loop to process each test case individually. For each test case, it should print "YES" or "NO" and, if applicable, the subsequence.
   - The current implementation lacks the necessary logic to iterate over all test cases and print the results for each one separately.

To correct this, the program needs to add a loop to handle each test case individually and ensure that the output format matches the problem description.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        
        nk = 0
        
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

In this corrected version, the program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case individually and prints the result for each test case as required.
