You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two arrays of integers a_1,…,a_n and b_1,…,b_m.

Your task is to find a non-empty array c_1,…,c_k that is a subsequence of a_1,…,a_n, and also a subsequence of b_1,…,b_m. If there are multiple answers, find one of the smallest possible length. If there are still multiple of the smallest possible length, find any. If there are no such arrays, you should report about it.

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1] and [4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the lengths of the two arrays.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the first array.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1,…,b_m (1≤ b_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the second array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i≤ 1000).

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if a solution exists, or "NO" otherwise.

If the answer is "YES", on the next line output an integer k (1≤ k≤ 1000) — the length of the array, followed by k integers c_1,…,c_k (1≤ c_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.

If there are multiple solutions with the smallest possible k, output any.

Example

5 3
1000 2 2 2 3
3 1 5
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5


Output


YES
1 4
YES
1 3
NO
YES
1 3
YES
1 2

Note

In the first test case, [4] is a subsequence of [10, 8, 6, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This array has length 1, it is the smallest possible length of a subsequence of both a and b.

In the third test case, no non-empty subsequences of both [3] and [2] exist, so the answer is "NO".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the arrays a_1,...,a_n and b_1,...,b_m consist of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000. Additionally, the sum of all n across all test cases and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i ≤ 1000).
def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        nk = 0
        
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the value of `n` for the last test case processed, `m` is the value of `m` for the last test case processed, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the last list `a_1,...,a_n`, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the last list `b_1,...,b_m`, `nk` is 0 or 1 depending on whether any element from `lst1` is found in `lst2`. If any element from `lst1` is found in `lst2`, the console displays 'YES' followed by '1' and the corresponding element. Otherwise, the console displays 'NO'.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
