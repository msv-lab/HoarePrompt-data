Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two lists of positive integers \( a_1, ..., a_n \) and \( b_1, ..., b_m \).

2. **Finding Common Elements**:
   - It converts the lists \( a_1, ..., a_n \) and \( b_1, ..., b_m \) into sets \( lst1 \) and \( lst2 \) respectively to efficiently find common elements.
   - It then iterates through the elements of \( lst1 \) and checks if they are present in \( lst2 \).
   - If a common element is found, it prints "YES" followed by "1" and the common element, indicating a valid subsequence. The program then breaks out of the loop early to avoid unnecessary checks.
   - If no common elements are found after checking all elements of \( lst1 \), it prints "NO".

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "YES" followed by "1" and the common element, which matches the required output format if a solution exists.
   - If no solution exists, it correctly outputs "NO".

4. **Guaranteed Termination**:
   - The program guarantees that it will terminate for each test case because it uses a finite loop over the elements of the sets.

Since the program follows the problem description exactly and handles all specified cases appropriately, the correctness is True.
