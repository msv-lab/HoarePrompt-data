You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two arrays of integers a_1,…,a_n and b_1,…,b_m.

Your task is to find a non-empty array c_1,…,c_k that is a subsequence of a_1,…,a_n, and also a subsequence of b_1,…,b_m. If there are multiple answers, find one of the smallest possible length. If there are still multiple of the smallest possible length, find any. If there are no such arrays, you should report about it.

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1] and [4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the lengths of the two arrays.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the first array.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1,…,b_m (1≤ b_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the second array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i≤ 1000).

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if a solution exists, or "NO" otherwise.

If the answer is "YES", on the next line output an integer k (1≤ k≤ 1000) — the length of the array, followed by k integers c_1,…,c_k (1≤ c_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.

If there are multiple solutions with the smallest possible k, output any.

Example

4 5
10 8 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
1 1

2
5 3
1000 2 2 2 3
3 1 5

1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5


Output


YES
1 4
YES
1 3
NO
YES
1 3
YES
1 2

Note

In the first test case, [4] is a subsequence of [10, 8, 6, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This array has length 1, it is the smallest possible length of a subsequence of both a and b.

In the third test case, no non-empty subsequences of both [3] and [2] exist, so the answer is "NO".
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        nk = 0
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program checks only for common elements between the two sets `lst1` and `lst2`. However, the problem requires finding the longest common subsequence, not just the longest common element. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2
4 5
10 8 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
5 3
1000 2 2 2 3
3 1 5
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
1 4
YES
1 3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
YES
1 4
NO
```

This is incorrect because although 4 is a common element, the program does not check for longer common subsequences. The correct output should include a subsequence of length 1 for the second test case. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the requirement of finding the longest common subsequence.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the arrays a_1,...,a_n and b_1,...,b_m consist of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000. Additionally, the sum of all n across all test cases and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i ≤ 1000).
def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        nk = 0
        
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the value of `n` for the last test case processed, `m` is the value of `m` for the last test case processed, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the last list `a_1,...,a_n`, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the last list `b_1,...,b_m`, `nk` is 0 or 1 depending on whether any element from `lst1` is found in `lst2`. If any element from `lst1` is found in `lst2`, the console displays 'YES' followed by '1' and the corresponding element. Otherwise, the console displays 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases, with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of positive integers `a_1,...,a_n` and `b_1,...,b_m`, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 1000\). The function then checks if there is any common element between the sets created from `lst1` and `lst2`. If a common element is found, it prints 'YES' followed by '1' and the common element. If no common elements are found, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any explicit value; instead, it relies on printing the results directly to the console for each test case.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
