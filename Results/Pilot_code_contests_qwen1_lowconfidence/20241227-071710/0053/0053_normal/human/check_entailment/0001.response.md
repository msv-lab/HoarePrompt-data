Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program checks only for common elements between the two sets `lst1` and `lst2`. However, the problem requires finding the longest common subsequence, not just the longest common element. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2
4 5
10 8 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
5 3
1000 2 2 2 3
3 1 5
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
1 4
YES
1 3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
YES
1 4
NO
```

This is incorrect because although 4 is a common element, the program does not check for longer common subsequences. The correct output should include a subsequence of length 1 for the second test case. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the requirement of finding the longest common subsequence.
