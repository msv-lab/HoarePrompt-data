Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code assumes that a solution always exists, which is not true. The problem statement requires the program to handle cases where no common subsequence exists. The current implementation only checks for the presence of any common element between the two lists and prints 'YES' followed by the first common element it finds, without considering whether there are multiple smallest subsequence solutions or reporting 'NO' when no such subsequence exists.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
4 5
10 8 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
5 3
1000 2 2 2 3
3 1 5
```

The output of the provided code would be:

```
YES
1 4
YES
1 3
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
YES
1 4
NO
```

Since the second test case has no common elements, the correct response should be 'NO', indicating that no such subsequence exists. Therefore, the code fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
