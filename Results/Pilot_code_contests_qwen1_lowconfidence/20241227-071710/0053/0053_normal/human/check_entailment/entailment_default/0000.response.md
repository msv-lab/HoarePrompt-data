Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the code only checks for the existence of at least one common element between the two lists and does not guarantee finding a subsequence of both lists. The problem requires finding a non-empty subsequence that is common to both lists, not just a single common element.

For example, consider the following test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 5
  10 8 6 4
  4 5 6 7 8
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  YES
  2 4 6
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  YES
  1 4
  ```

The code only checks if there is at least one common element between the two lists and prints the first common element it finds. In the example above, `4` is a common element, but it is not a subsequence of both lists. The correct output should include a subsequence like `[4, 6]`.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
