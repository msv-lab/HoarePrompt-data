Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the arrays a_1,...,a_n and b_1,...,b_m consist of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000. Additionally, the sum of all n across all test cases and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i ≤ 1000).**
