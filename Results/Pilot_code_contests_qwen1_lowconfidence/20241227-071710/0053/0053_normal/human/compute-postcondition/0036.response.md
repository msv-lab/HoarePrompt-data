The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements in the list. The original values of `lst2`, `nk`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a list of integers created from the input, `nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**
