You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the arrays a_1,...,a_n and b_1,...,b_m consist of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000. Additionally, the sum of all n across all test cases and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i ≤ 1000).
def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        nk = 0
        
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the value of `n` for the last test case processed, `m` is the value of `m` for the last test case processed, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the last list `a_1,...,a_n`, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the last list `b_1,...,b_m`, `nk` is 0 or 1 depending on whether any element from `lst1` is found in `lst2`. If any element from `lst1` is found in `lst2`, the console displays 'YES' followed by '1' and the corresponding element. Otherwise, the console displays 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each test case \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq t\)), the function also accepts two positive integers `n_i` and `m_i` such that \(1 \leq n_i, m_i \leq 1000\), and two arrays `a_1,...,a_{n_i}` and `b_1,...,b_{m_i}` consisting of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_j, b_k \leq 1000\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq n_i\) and \(1 \leq k \leq m_i\). Additionally, the sum of all \(n_i\) across all test cases and the sum of all \(m_i\) across all test cases do not exceed 1000 (\(\sum_{i=1}^t n_i, \sum_{i=1}^t m_i \leq 1000\)).
#
#Case_1: The function returns a value based on some condition involving the arrays `a_1,...,a_{n_i}` and `b_1,...,b_{m_i}` for each test case \(i\).
#
#Case_2: The function returns an error message if any of the constraints are violated.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a parameter `t` and for each test case \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq t\)), accept two positive integers `n_i` and `m_i` along with two arrays `a_1,...,a_{n_i}` and `b_1,...,b_{m_i}`. It then processes these inputs according to some condition and returns a value or an error message based on the given constraints and conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
