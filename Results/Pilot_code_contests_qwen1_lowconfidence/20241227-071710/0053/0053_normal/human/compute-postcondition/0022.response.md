The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables. It only prints the string 'YES' to the console. The variables `lst1`, `lst2`, `i`, and `nk` retain their original states.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, if `i` is in `lst2`, then `nk` is set to 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged; the console prints 'YES'**
