Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element and has one fewer element than before, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), and `nk` is 1. If `i` is in `lst2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not in `lst2`, nothing changes.***
