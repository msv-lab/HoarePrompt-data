The code initializes the variable `nk` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `lst1`, or `lst2`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers derived from the split input, `nk` is 0**
