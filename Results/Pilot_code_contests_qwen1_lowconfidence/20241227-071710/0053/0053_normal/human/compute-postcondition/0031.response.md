To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop runs based on the input provided by `int(input())`.
2. The loop continues as long as there is an integer input.
3. Since `nk` remains 0, it means no element from `lst1` was found in `lst2` and printed in the previous iterations.

Given these points, let's analyze the situation:

- The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `lst1` is a set of integers, `lst2` is a set of integers, and `nk` remains 0.
- The loop is controlled by the input, and as long as the input is an integer, the loop will continue.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide another integer input.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `lst1` is a set of integers (unchanged).
- `lst2` is a set of integers (unchanged).
- `nk` remains 0 (unchanged).

The only thing that changes is the input, which should now be an integer.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`lst1` is a set of integers, `lst2` is a set of integers, and `nk` remains 0**.
