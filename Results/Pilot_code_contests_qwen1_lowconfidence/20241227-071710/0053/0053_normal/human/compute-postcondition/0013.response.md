The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is within. Since there is no loop or if statement context provided in the initial state, the only impact is that the program would break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. The values of `nk`, `lst1`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nk` is 1, `lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is an integer that exists in `lst2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
