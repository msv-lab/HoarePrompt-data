The code `nk = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `nk`. The value of `nk` was previously 1, and this value remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is 1, and we print '1', `i` where `i` is one of the elements from `lst1`.**
