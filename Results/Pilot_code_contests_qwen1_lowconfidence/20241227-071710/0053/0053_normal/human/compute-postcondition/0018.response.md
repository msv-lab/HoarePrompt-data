`nk` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `lst1`, `i`, and the printed output remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, `nk` is `1`, printed output is `1` followed by the value of `i`.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, `nk` is `1`, printed output is `1` followed by the value of `i`**
