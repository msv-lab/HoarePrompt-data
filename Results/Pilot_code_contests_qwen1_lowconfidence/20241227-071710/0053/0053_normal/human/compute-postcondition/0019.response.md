The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but since there is no loop in the given code snippet, its effect is minimal. The output state remains unchanged because the `break` statement does not alter any variable values or create new conditions. However, the printed output is already specified as `1` followed by the value of `i`. This printed output does not affect the state of the variables.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, `nk` is `1`**
