The code `lst2 = set(lst2)` converts the list `lst2` into a set. In doing so, any duplicate elements in `lst2` will be removed, and the order of elements is no longer guaranteed since sets do not maintain order.

Given the initial state:
- `lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list
- `lst2` is a list of integers created from the input
- `nk` is 0
- `n` is an integer from the input
- `m` is an integer from the input

After executing the code `lst2 = set(lst2)`, the following changes occur:
- `lst2` is now a set (with no duplicates and unordered)
- All other variables (`lst1`, `nk`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`lst1` is a set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set (with no duplicates and unordered), `nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**
