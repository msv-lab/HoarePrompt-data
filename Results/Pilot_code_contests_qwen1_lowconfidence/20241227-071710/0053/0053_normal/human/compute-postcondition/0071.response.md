The code `print(1, i)` simply prints the integer 1 followed by the value of `i`. The value of `i` is already known from the initial state and is an element of both `lst1` and `lst2`. The print statement does not affect the values of the variables, it only outputs them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is 0, `i` is the first element of `lst1`, and the string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
