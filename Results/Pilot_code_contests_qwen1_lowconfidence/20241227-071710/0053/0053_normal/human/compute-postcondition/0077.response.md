The code prints `1` followed by the value of `i`. The value of `i` is taken from `lst1`. Since `lst1` is a set of unique integers, `i` is one of those integers. After printing, the variables `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `nk`, and `i` remain in their previous states, except that `i` is now consumed from `lst1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is 1, and we print '1', `i` where `i` is one of the elements from `lst1`.**
