The code `print(1, i)` simply prints the numbers 1 and `i`. It does not assign any new values to variables or change the existing values of `lst1` or `i`. The output of the print statement is shown on the console but does not affect the variables' states.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is an integer that exists in `lst2`**
