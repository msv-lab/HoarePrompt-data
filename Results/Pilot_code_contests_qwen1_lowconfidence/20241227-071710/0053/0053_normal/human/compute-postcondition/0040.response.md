The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, and `i` is in `lst2`. Printed output: 'YES'**
