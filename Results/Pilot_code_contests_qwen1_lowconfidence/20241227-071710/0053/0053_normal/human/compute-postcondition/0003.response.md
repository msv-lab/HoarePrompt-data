The code creates a list `lst1` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. This means that the values of `n` and `m` are taken from the input and stored as elements in `lst1`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged since no operation is performed on it within the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `lst1` is a list containing integers from the input string.**
