The code `nk = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `nk`. The value of `nk` was previously 1, but since it remains 1 after the assignment, it does not change. All other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element and has one fewer element than before, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is 1**
