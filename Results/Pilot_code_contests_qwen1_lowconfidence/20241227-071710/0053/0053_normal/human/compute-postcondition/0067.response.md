The code `lst2 = set(lst2)` converts the list `lst2` into a set. This means that any duplicate elements in `lst2` will be removed, and the order of elements may change. The values of `n`, `m`, `lst1`, and `nk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is 0**
