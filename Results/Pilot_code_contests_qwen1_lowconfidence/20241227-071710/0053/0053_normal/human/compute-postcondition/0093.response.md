Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases, with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of positive integers `a_1,...,a_n` and `b_1,...,b_m`, where \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\) and \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 1000\). The function then checks if there is any common element between the sets created from `lst1` and `lst2`. If a common element is found, it prints 'YES' followed by '1' and the common element. If no common elements are found, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any explicit value; instead, it relies on printing the results directly to the console for each test case.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where there are common elements between the two sets.
- However, it does not handle the case where `lst1` and `lst2` are empty. In such a scenario, the function would still proceed and check for common elements, which might lead to unexpected behavior since the sets are initially created from the input lists without considering the possibility of them being empty.
- Another potential issue is the handling of duplicate elements within `lst1` and `lst2`. Since the code uses sets (`lst1` and `lst2`), duplicate elements are automatically removed, but this behavior should be noted for clarity.

In summary, the function processes multiple test cases, checking for common elements between two sets derived from the input lists and prints the appropriate result for each test case.
