Postcondition: ***`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether an element in `lst1` also exists in `lst2`. If such an element exists, the program prints 'YES' followed by 1 and the element. Otherwise, `nk` remains 0 and no additional print statements are executed.***
