The code `nk = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `nk`. This does not affect the values of `lst1` or `i`. The console prints '1' and `i`, but the code itself does not perform this print action. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `nk`.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, `nk` is 1**
