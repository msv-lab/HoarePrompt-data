The code prints `1` followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is in `lst2`, it does not affect the sets `lst1` and `lst2`, nor does it change the values of `nk`, `n`, or `m`. The printed output `'YES'` is not directly assigned to any variable, so it remains part of the output but not part of the updated state.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, and `i` is in `lst2`. The program printed '1' and `i`.**
