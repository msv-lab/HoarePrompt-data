The code `break` is executed, which does not affect the values of any variables but indicates the exit from the current loop or conditional block. The initial states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, 'YES' is printed, and 1 and `i` are printed to the console.**
