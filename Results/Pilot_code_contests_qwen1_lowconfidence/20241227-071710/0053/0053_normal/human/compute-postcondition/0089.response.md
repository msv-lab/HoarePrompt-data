The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is 0, and no element from `lst1` was found in `lst2`. The console displays 'NO'**.
