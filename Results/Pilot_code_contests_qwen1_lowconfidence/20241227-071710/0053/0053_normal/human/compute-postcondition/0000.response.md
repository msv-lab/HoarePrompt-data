The provided code snippet is a lambda function definition for `input` that reads from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This does not actually perform any operations that would change the values of existing variables or introduce new ones. It simply redefines how the `input` function behaves.

Therefore, the only thing impacted here is how subsequent calls to `input` will operate, but since no actual input or assignment is performed in this snippet, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and the arrays `a_1,...,a_n` and `b_1,...,b_m` consist of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000, and the sum of all n across all test cases and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 1000 ( ∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i ≤ 1000).**
