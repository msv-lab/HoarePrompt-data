The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The only variables mentioned in the initial state are `lst1`, `i`, and `nk`. 

- `lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element.
- `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`.
- `nk` is 0.

Since the code does not alter these variables or their values, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, `nk` is 0**.
