The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables; it only prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the values of `lst1`, `lst2`, `nk`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers from the input, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, print statement outputs 'YES'**
