The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each test case \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq t\)), the function also accepts two positive integers `n_i` and `m_i` such that \(1 \leq n_i, m_i \leq 1000\), and two arrays `a_1,...,a_{n_i}` and `b_1,...,b_{m_i}` consisting of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_j, b_k \leq 1000\) for all \(1 \leq j \leq n_i\) and \(1 \leq k \leq m_i\). Additionally, the sum of all \(n_i\) across all test cases and the sum of all \(m_i\) across all test cases do not exceed 1000 (\(\sum_{i=1}^t n_i, \sum_{i=1}^t m_i \leq 1000\)).

Case_1: The function returns a value based on some condition involving the arrays `a_1,...,a_{n_i}` and `b_1,...,b_{m_i}` for each test case \(i\).

Case_2: The function returns an error message if any of the constraints are violated.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a parameter `t` and for each test case \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq t\)), accept two positive integers `n_i` and `m_i` along with two arrays `a_1,...,a_{n_i}` and `b_1,...,b_{m_i}`. It then processes these inputs according to some condition and returns a value or an error message based on the given constraints and conditions.
