The code `lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer before assigning the resulting list to `lst2`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the list `lst1` remains unchanged.

Let's assume the input for `input().split()` is `a b c`. This means `lst2` would be `[int(a), int(b), int(c)]`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we will denote them as generic integers. Therefore, `lst2` will be a list of integers derived from the split input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers derived from the split input**.
