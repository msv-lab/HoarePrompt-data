The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is 0, `i` is the first element of `lst1`. The current value of `i` is in `lst2` and the string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
