The code splits the input into a list of integers. The input is expected to be a series of space-separated integers. These integers will be converted to a list of integers. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Let's denote the input as `a b c d e ...` where `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, etc., are integers.

- `n` remains an integer from the input.
- `m` remains the next integer from the input.
- `lst1` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the input**.
