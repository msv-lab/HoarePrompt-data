The code `nk = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `nk`. This does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The program also printed '1' and `i`, which is still true after the code execution.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, and `i` is in `lst2`. The program printed '1' and `i`.**
