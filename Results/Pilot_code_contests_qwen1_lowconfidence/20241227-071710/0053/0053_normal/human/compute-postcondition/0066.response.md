The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements in `lst1`. Since the initial state of `lst1` is a list of integers, converting it to a set means that any duplicates in `lst1` will be removed.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer from the input
- `m` is the next integer from the input
- `lst1` is a list of integers from the input
- `lst2` is a list of integers derived from the split input
- `nk` is 0

After executing the code `lst1 = set(lst1)`, the list `lst1` is transformed into a set. The values of `n`, `m`, `lst2`, and `nk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers derived from the split input, `nk` is 0**
