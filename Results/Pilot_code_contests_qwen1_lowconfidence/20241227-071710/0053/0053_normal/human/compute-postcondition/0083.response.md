The code `print(1, i)` will print "1" followed by the value of `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Given the initial state and the lack of definition for `i`, we can infer that `i` might be related to `n` or `m` from the initial state, but since `i` is not explicitly defined in the code, we cannot determine its exact value.

Since `i` is not defined and no operation is performed on `i`, the only thing that happens is the print statement. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be "1" followed by whatever the value of `i` is, which is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element and has one fewer element than before, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), and `nk` is 1; the output of the program is "1" followed by the value of `i`.**
