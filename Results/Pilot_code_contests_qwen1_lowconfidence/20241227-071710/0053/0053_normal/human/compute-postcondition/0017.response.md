The code `print(1, i)` prints the integer 1 followed by the value of `i`. This does not change the values of any variables but rather outputs them. The variable `nk` remains unchanged, and the set `lst1` and the list `lst2` retain their initial state since no operations are performed on them.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, `nk` is 0, printed output is 1 followed by the value of `i`**
