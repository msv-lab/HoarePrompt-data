The code prints the value `1` and the next element in `lst1`. The variable `i` is updated to the next element in `lst1`, and the print statement outputs 'YES'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers from the input, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, print statement outputs 'YES', printed output is `1` and the next element in `lst1`**
