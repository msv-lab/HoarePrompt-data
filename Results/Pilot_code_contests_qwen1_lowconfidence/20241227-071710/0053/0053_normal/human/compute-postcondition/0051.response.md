Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list.
   - `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered.
   - `nk` is 1.
   - `n` and `m` are integers from the input.
   - `i` is the next element in `lst1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst1`.
   - For each element `i` in `lst1`, the program checks if `i` is in `lst2`.
   - If `i` is in `lst2`, it prints "YES" and 1 and `i`.
   - If `i` is not in `lst2`, the program continues without any additional changes to the variables.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `lst1` is a set, it contains unique elements.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `lst1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` will be the next element in `lst1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one of the elements in `lst1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `lst1`.
   - All other variables (`lst1`, `lst2`, `nk`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body (which is not specified here).

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

- `i` will be the next element in `lst1`.

Since the loop is iterating over all elements in `lst1`, and assuming `lst1` still contains elements, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers from the input, `i` is the next element in `lst1`.**
