The code initializes the variable `nk` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`). Therefore, the only change is that `nk` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `lst1` is a list containing integers from the input string; `lst2` is a list of integers from the input string split and converted to integers; `nk` is 0.**
