The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since the input values are not specified, let's denote the input values as `a` and `b` where `a` and `b` are integers.

The code impacts the following:
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `m` is assigned the second integer from the input.

Therefore, the output state will be:
Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input**
