Postcondition: ***`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input. If `i` is in `lst2`, the program prints '1' and `i`. There is no change in `lst1`, `lst2`, `nk`, `n`, and `m` in the absence of the else part.***
