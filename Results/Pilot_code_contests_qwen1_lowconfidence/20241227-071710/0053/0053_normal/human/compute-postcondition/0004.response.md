The code creates a new list `lst2` by converting each element in the input string into an integer using a list comprehension. The input string is split using `split()`, which separates the string into individual elements based on whitespace.

Let's break down the impact:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
- `lst1` is not used in the code, so it remains unchanged.
- `lst2` is created by converting each element of the input string into an integer.

Since the input string is split and then converted to integers, `lst2` will contain integers from the input string. The exact values in `lst2` depend on the input provided during execution, but we know that `lst1` is not altered and remains as a list of integers from the input string.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `lst1` is a list containing integers from the input string; `lst2` is a list of integers from the input string split and converted to integers.**
