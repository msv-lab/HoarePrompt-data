The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set. This operation removes any duplicate elements in `lst1`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in `lst1`, we know that after executing this line of code, `lst1` will become a set, potentially with fewer elements than before if there were duplicates.

The states of other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `lst2`, and `nk`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string; `lst2` is a list of integers from the input string split and converted to integers; `nk` is 0.**
