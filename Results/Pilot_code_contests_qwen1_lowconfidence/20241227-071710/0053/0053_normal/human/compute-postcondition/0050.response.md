Postcondition: ***`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers from the input, `i` is the next element in `lst1`. If `i` is in `lst2`, then 'YES' is printed and 1 and `i` are printed to the console. If `i` is not in `lst2`, the program continues without any additional changes to the variables.***
