The `break` statement is used to exit the closest enclosing loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block present in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change any variable values or add new information to the state. It simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer from the input
- `m` is the next integer from the input
- `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element
- `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed)
- `nk` is `1`
- `i` is the first element of `lst1`
- the string 'YES' is printed to the console

Since the `break` statement does not affect any of these variables or their values, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is `1`, `i` is the first element of `lst1`, and the string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
