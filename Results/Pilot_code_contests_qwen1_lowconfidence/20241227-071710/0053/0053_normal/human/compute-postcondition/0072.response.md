`nk` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `i`, and the string 'YES') remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is `1`, `i` is the first element of `lst1`, and the string 'YES' is printed to the console.
