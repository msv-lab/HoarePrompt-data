According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the set `lst1`. The loop iterates over each element in `lst1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), and `nk` is `1`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- `i` will be the next element from `lst1`.
- `lst1` must still contain at least one element.

Since `lst1` must have at least one element, and it's an iterator, we need to ensure that `lst1` still has elements left to iterate over. If `lst1` has more than one element, the loop can execute again with the next element being `i`.

Let's summarize the states:
- `n` remains as an integer from the input.
- `m` remains as the next integer from the input.
- `lst1` must have at least one element left for the loop to execute again.
- `lst2` remains as a set of integers (with duplicates removed).
- `nk` remains `1`.
- `i` will be the next element from `lst1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is `1`, and `i` is the next element from `lst1`**.
