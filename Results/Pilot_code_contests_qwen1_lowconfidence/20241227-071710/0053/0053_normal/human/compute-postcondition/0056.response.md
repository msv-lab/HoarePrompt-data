Postcondition: ***`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers from the input. If `i` is in `lst2`, the print statement outputs 'YES' and we break out of the most internal loop or match statement. If `i` is not in `lst2`, no change occurs to the variables.***
