The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input.**
