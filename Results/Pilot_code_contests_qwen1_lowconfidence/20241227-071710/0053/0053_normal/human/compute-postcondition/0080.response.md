Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is 1, and if `i` is in `lst2`, we print '1', `i`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
