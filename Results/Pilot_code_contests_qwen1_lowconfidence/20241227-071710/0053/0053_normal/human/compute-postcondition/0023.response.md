The code `print(1, i)` prints the value `1` followed by the value of `i`. The variable `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`. The print statement does not affect the values of the variables, it only outputs them.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, the console prints '1' and `i`**
