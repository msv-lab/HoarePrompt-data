The code `break` is used to exit a loop or the most internal block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block (like a `for`, `while`, or `if` statement) specified in the given code snippet, the break statement does not affect any variables directly. The print statements before the break statement have already executed, and the variables `nk`, `n`, `m`, and `i` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, and `i` is in `lst2`. The program printed '1' and `i`.**
