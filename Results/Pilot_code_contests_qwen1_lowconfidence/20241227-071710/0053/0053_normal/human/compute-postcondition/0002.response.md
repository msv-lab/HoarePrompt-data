The code `n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` splits the input string into two parts and converts them into integers, assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and the input provided to `int(input())` must be greater than 0. After executing the code, `t` remains unchanged, and both `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input string.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input.**
