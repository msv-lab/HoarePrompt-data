Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is 0, and if an element `i` from `lst1` is found in `lst2`, 'YES' is printed followed by '1' and `i'. Since `nk` is 0, no element from `lst1` was found in `lst2`.***
