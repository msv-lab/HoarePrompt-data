The code snippet replaces the content of `lst2` with a new list created from the input split into integers. The previous value of `lst1` remains unchanged. The values of `nk`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged. 

Let's denote the input received from the user as a string, which is then split and converted to integers to form the new `lst2`. 

For example, if the input is "1 2 3", then `lst2` would be `[1, 2, 3]`.

Output State: **`lst1` is a list of integers created from the input, `lst2` is a list of integers created from the input, `nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**
