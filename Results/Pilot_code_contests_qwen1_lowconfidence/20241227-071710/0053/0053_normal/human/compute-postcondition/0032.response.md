The code splits the input into two integers `n` and `m`, which are then assigned to `n` and `m` respectively. This means that `lst1` and `lst2` remain sets of integers, and `nk` remains 0. The values of `n` and `m` are specifically defined as the integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers, `lst2` is a set of integers, `nk` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**
