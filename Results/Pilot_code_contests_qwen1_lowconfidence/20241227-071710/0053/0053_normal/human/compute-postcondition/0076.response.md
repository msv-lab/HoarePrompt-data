The code `print('YES')` does not change any of the variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), `nk` is `1`, and `i` is the next element from `lst1`. The console displays 'YES'.**
