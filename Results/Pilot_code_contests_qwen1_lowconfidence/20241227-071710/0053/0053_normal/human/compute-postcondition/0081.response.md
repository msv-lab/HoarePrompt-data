Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `m` is the next integer from the input.
   - `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element.
   - `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed).
   - `nk` is 1.
   - If `i` is in `lst2`, we print '1', `i`.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `lst1`.
   - For each `i` in `lst1`, it checks if `i` is in `lst2`.
   - If `i` is in `lst2`, it prints '1', `i`.

3. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was processed from `lst1`.
   - Since `lst1` is a set and it must have at least one element, the next `i` to be processed will be the next element in `lst1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should include:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `lst1` loses one element since `i` from the previous iteration was processed. The new state will have one fewer element in `lst1`.
- `lst2` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `nk` remains 1 unless the loop body changes it, but no such change is mentioned.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element and has one fewer element than before, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), and `nk` is 1**.
