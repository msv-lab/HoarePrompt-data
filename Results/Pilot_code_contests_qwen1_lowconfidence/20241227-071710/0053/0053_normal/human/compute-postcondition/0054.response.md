The code `nk = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `nk`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers from the input, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, print statement outputs 'YES', printed output is `1` and the next element in `lst1`**
