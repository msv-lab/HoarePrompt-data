The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, it is used to exit the loop or match where the condition was met, causing the "YES" print statement. However, the code snippet provided does not show which loop or match statement this `break` is exiting. Given the context, we can infer that the `break` statement causes the loop or match to end, and the `print('YES')` statement has already been executed.

After the `break` statement is executed, the following variables and their states remain unchanged:
- `lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list.
- `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered.
- `nk` is 1.
- `n` and `m` are integers from the input.
- `i` is the next element in `lst1`.

The `print('YES')` statement has already outputted `1`, and the next element in `lst1` is yet to be processed or printed after the `break` statement.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers from the input, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, the print statement outputs 'YES', and we break out of the most internal loop or match statement.**
