The code simply prints 'YES', which does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, and 'YES' is printed.**
