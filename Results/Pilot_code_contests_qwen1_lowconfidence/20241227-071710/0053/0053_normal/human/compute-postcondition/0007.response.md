The code `lst2 = set(lst2)` changes the type of `lst2` from a list to a set. Since sets cannot contain duplicate elements, any duplicates in `lst2` will be removed. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `lst1`, and `nk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `lst1` is a set of integers from the input string; `lst2` is a set of integers from the input string split and converted to integers; `nk` is 0.**
