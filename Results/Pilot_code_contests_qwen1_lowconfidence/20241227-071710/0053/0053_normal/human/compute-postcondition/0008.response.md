According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst1`. For the loop to execute, `lst1` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `lst2`, and `nk`) do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they remain as part of the overall program state.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **`t`**: It is given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This constraint is not relevant to the loop's execution condition.
2. **`n`**: This is the first integer from the input. Its value is irrelevant for the loop's execution.
3. **`m`**: This is the second integer from the input. Its value is irrelevant for the loop's execution.
4. **`lst1`**: This is a set of integers from the input string. For the loop to execute, `lst1` must contain at least one element.
5. **`lst2`**: This is a set of integers from the input string split and converted to integers. Its value is irrelevant for the loop's execution.
6. **`nk`**: This is initialized to 0. Its value is irrelevant for the loop's execution.

Given these points, the critical state adjustment required for the loop to execute is that `lst1` must have at least one element.

State: **`lst1` is a set of integers that must have at least one element**
