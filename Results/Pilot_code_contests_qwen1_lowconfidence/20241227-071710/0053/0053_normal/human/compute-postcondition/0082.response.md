The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is the next integer from the input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input that must have at least one element and has one fewer element than before, `lst2` is a set of integers (with duplicates removed), and `nk` is 1**
