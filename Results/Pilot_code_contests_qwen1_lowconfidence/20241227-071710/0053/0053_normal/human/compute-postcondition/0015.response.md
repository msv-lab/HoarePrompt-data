Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is that `lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element. The variable `i` represents an element from `lst1`. There is a condition where if `i` is found in `lst2`, then `nk` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `lst1`.

3. **Possible Outcomes in the Loop**:
   - If `i` is found in `lst2`, then `nk` is set to 1 and the loop is exited.
   - If `i` is not found in `lst2`, the state remains unchanged, and the loop continues to the next element in `lst1`.

4. **Determine the New State**:
   - Since the state must be modified for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that the current element `i` is not found in `lst2` (as this would exit the loop immediately).
   - Therefore, `i` should not be in `lst2` for the loop to continue.

5. **Updated State**:
   - `lst1` still contains at least one element.
   - The current value of `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`.
   - `nk` remains unchanged (which is 0 if no element in `lst1` was found in `lst2`).

Given these points, the new state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, `nk` is 0**.
