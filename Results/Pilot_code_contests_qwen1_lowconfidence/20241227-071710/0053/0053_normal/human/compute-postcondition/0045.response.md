Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list.
   - `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered.
   - `nk` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `m` is an integer from the input.
   
2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `lst1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `i` is in `lst2`, the program prints '1' and `i`.
   - There is no change in `lst1`, `lst2`, `nk`, `n`, and `m` in the absence of the else part.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `lst1` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `lst2` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `nk` remains 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `i` has just been processed, but its value does not affect the sets or the other variables.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `i` must be taken from `lst1`.
   - Since `lst1` is a set and contains unique elements, we simply take the next element in the sequence.

6. **Updated States**:
   - `lst1` remains unchanged.
   - `lst2` remains unchanged.
   - `nk` remains 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `i` changes to the next element in `lst1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`lst1` is a non-empty set containing unique elements from the original list, `lst2` is a set with no duplicates and unordered, `nk` is 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `i` is the next element in `lst1`**
