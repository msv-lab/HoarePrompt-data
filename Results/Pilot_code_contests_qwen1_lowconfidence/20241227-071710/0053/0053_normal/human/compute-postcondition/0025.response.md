The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the current block of code. However, since no block is specified, we assume this is outside any such block, and thus the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst1` is a set of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `lst1` that is not in `lst2`, `nk` is 1**
