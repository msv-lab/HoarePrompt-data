The function reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns the list. This operation can handle lines containing any number of space-separated values. If the input line is empty, the function will still return an empty list. No error handling is included for non-space-separated inputs or other types of invalid input, which could result in a list containing individual characters instead of substrings.
