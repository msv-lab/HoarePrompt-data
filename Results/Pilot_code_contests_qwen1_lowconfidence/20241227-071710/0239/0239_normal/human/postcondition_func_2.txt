The function `func_3` accepts five parameters: `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`. It returns the maximum number of dominoes that can fall within the specified query range `[l, r]` by using a segment tree. The function checks if the current segment `[s, e]` is outside the query range, in which case it returns 0. If the current segment exactly matches the query range or its size is too small, it returns the precomputed value in `seg[x]`. Otherwise, it splits the segment into two halves and recursively queries the left and right halves, returning the maximum value between the two results.
