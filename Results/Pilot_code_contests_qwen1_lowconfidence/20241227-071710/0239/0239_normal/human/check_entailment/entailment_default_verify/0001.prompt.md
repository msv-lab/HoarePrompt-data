You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the functions `func_2` and `func_3`, which are intended to update and query a segment tree. However, these functions do not handle the dominoes' coordinates and heights properly. Specifically:

1. **Segment Tree Initialization**: The segment tree is not initialized or defined anywhere in the code.
2. **Coordinate Handling**: The function `func_4` tries to find the relevant segment to query, but it does not correctly handle the overlap between the pushed domino's range and the segments in the segment tree.
3. **Height Consideration**: The height `h` of the domino is not correctly used to update the segment tree, which means the segment tree will not reflect the correct fall conditions for the dominoes.

To illustrate the failure, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
16 5
20 5
10 10
18 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 1 4 1 
```

However, running the provided code will not produce the correct output. The segment tree approach is fundamentally flawed in this context because it does not correctly propagate the effects of pushing a domino to the right, considering both the coordinate and height constraints.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case and thus is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input and performs a binary search to find the index `e` such that `dom[e][0] >= x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the first and second elements of `dom[i]`. After determining `e`, it calls `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is the length of the `dom` list, and returns the result of this function call. The function handles the case where no such `e` exists by setting `s` to `i` when the loop terminates. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that `i` is a valid index within the range of the `dom` list. If `i` is out of bounds, it would cause an error before the binary search begins. Additionally, the function does not explicitly check if `x + h` is greater than the maximum possible value in the `dom` list, which could lead to incorrect behavior if such a scenario arises.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
