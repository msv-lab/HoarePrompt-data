You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns the list. This operation can handle lines containing any number of space-separated values. If the input line is empty, the function will still return an empty list. No error handling is included for non-space-separated inputs or other types of invalid input, which could result in a list containing individual characters instead of substrings.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(i, val, s, e, x):
    seg[x] = max(seg[x], val)
    if e - s < 2:
        return
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if i < m:
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)
    else:
        func_2(i, val, m, e, 2 * x + 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function updates a specific value in a segment tree. It accepts parameters `i`, `val`, `s`, `e`, and `x`, where `i` is the index of the domino within the range `[s, e)`, `val` is the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, `s` and `e` define the current segment of the segment tree being updated, and `x` is the current node index in the segment tree. The function updates the segment tree by recursively traversing the appropriate segments based on the index `i`.

The function ensures that the segment tree node at index `x` is updated to `max(seg[x], val)`.

Potential edge case: If the difference between `e` and `s` is less than 2, the function returns without updating the segment tree, as indicated by the comment.

Missing functionality: The function does not return any value, which aligns with the provided return postconditions. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `s` and `e` might not form a valid segment, though this would typically be handled by the caller ensuring valid inputs.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(x, s, e, l, r):
    print('infind %d %d-%d %d-%d' % (x, s, e, l, r))
    if s >= r or e <= l:
        return 0
    print('passed')
    if s == l and e == r or e - s < 2:
        print('wtf? %d' % seg[x])
        return seg[x]
    m = (e + s) / 2
    return max(func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)), func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m, l), r))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts five parameters: `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`. It returns the maximum number of dominoes that can fall within the specified query range `[l, r]` by using a segment tree. The function checks if the current segment `[s, e]` is outside the query range, in which case it returns 0. If the current segment exactly matches the query range or its size is too small, it returns the precomputed value in `seg[x]`. Otherwise, it splits the segment into two halves and recursively queries the left and right halves, returning the maximum value between the two results.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(i):
    [x, h] = dom[i][0:2]
    s = i
    e = n
    while e - s > 1:
        m = int((e + s) / 2)
        print('bs %d' % m)
        if dom[m][0] < x + h:
            s = m
        else:
            e = m
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))
    return func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input and performs a binary search to find the index `e` such that `dom[e][0] >= x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the first and second elements of `dom[i]`. After determining `e`, it calls `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is the length of the `dom` list, and returns the result of this function call. The function handles the case where no such `e` exists by setting `s` to `i` when the loop terminates. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that `i` is a valid index within the range of the `dom` list. If `i` is out of bounds, it would cause an error before the binary search begins. Additionally, the function does not explicitly check if `x + h` is greater than the maximum possible value in the `dom` list, which could lead to incorrect behavior if such a scenario arises.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
