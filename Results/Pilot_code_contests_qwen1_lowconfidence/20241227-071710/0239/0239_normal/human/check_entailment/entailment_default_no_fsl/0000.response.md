Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where a domino is pushed to the right and there are no other dominoes that can fall as a result. Specifically, the code does not properly update the segment tree to reflect the fall of dominoes caused by pushing a domino to the right. The function `func_2` only updates the segment tree for the specific domino being pushed and does not propagate the effect to subsequent dominoes that may also fall as a result.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
10 5
15 5
20 5
25 5
```

If we push the first domino (at position 10 with height 5) to the right, it should cause the second, third, and fourth dominoes to fall as well. However, the current implementation only updates the segment tree for the first domino and does not account for the subsequent dominoes falling due to the initial push.

To fix this, the code needs to propagate the fall of dominoes to all subsequent dominoes that are affected by the initial push. This requires additional logic to ensure that the segment tree is updated correctly to reflect the cascading effect of the domino fall.
