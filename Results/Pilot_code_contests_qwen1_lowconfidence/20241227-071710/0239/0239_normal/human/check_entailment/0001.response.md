Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the functions `func_2` and `func_3`, which are intended to update and query a segment tree. However, these functions do not handle the dominoes' coordinates and heights properly. Specifically:

1. **Segment Tree Initialization**: The segment tree is not initialized or defined anywhere in the code.
2. **Coordinate Handling**: The function `func_4` tries to find the relevant segment to query, but it does not correctly handle the overlap between the pushed domino's range and the segments in the segment tree.
3. **Height Consideration**: The height `h` of the domino is not correctly used to update the segment tree, which means the segment tree will not reflect the correct fall conditions for the dominoes.

To illustrate the failure, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
16 5
20 5
10 10
18 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 1 4 1 
```

However, running the provided code will not produce the correct output. The segment tree approach is fundamentally flawed in this context because it does not correctly propagate the effects of pushing a domino to the right, considering both the coordinate and height constraints.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
