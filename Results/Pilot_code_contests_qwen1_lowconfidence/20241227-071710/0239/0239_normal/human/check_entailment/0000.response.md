Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` appear to be related to segment tree operations, but they are not used appropriately to solve the problem. The main issue is with `func_4`, which is supposed to calculate the number of dominoes that would fall if the i-th domino is pushed to the right. However, the logic within `func_4` is flawed.

Here's a detailed explanation of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Range to Consider**: The logic inside `func_4` uses a binary search to find the farthest domino that could be affected by pushing the i-th domino. The current implementation incorrectly updates the search range (`s` and `e`) without considering the actual fall range of the domino.

2. **Incorrect Use of Segment Tree Functions**: The segment tree functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) are not used to accumulate the fall counts correctly. They seem to be set up for a range maximum query, but they are not being utilized in a way that would provide the necessary cumulative information.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a combination of sorting and sweep line technique. Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Sort the Dominoes by Their Coordinates**: This helps in processing them in order.
2. **Use a Sweep Line Approach**: Maintain a variable to track the end of the current fall region and update the count of falling dominoes as needed.

Given these issues, the provided code does not handle the problem correctly, hence the output is incorrect for some cases.
