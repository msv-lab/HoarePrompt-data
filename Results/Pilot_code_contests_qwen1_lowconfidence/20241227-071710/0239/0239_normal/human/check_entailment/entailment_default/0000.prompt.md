You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

print(out)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns the list. This operation can handle lines containing any number of space-separated values. If the input line is empty, the function will still return an empty list. No error handling is included for non-space-separated inputs or other types of invalid input, which could result in a list containing individual characters instead of substrings.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(i, val, s, e, x):
    seg[x] = max(seg[x], val)
    if e - s < 2:
        return
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if i < m:
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)
    else:
        func_2(i, val, m, e, 2 * x + 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function updates a specific value in a segment tree. It accepts parameters `i`, `val`, `s`, `e`, and `x`, where `i` is the index of the domino within the range `[s, e)`, `val` is the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, `s` and `e` define the current segment of the segment tree being updated, and `x` is the current node index in the segment tree. The function updates the segment tree by recursively traversing the appropriate segments based on the index `i`.

The function ensures that the segment tree node at index `x` is updated to `max(seg[x], val)`.

Potential edge case: If the difference between `e` and `s` is less than 2, the function returns without updating the segment tree, as indicated by the comment.

Missing functionality: The function does not return any value, which aligns with the provided return postconditions. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `s` and `e` might not form a valid segment, though this would typically be handled by the caller ensuring valid inputs.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(x, s, e, l, r):
    print('infind %d %d-%d %d-%d' % (x, s, e, l, r))
    if s >= r or e <= l:
        return 0
    print('passed')
    if s == l and e == r or e - s < 2:
        print('wtf? %d' % seg[x])
        return seg[x]
    m = (e + s) / 2
    return max(func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)), func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m, l), r))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts five parameters: `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`. It returns the maximum number of dominoes that can fall within the specified query range `[l, r]` by using a segment tree. The function checks if the current segment `[s, e]` is outside the query range, in which case it returns 0. If the current segment exactly matches the query range or its size is too small, it returns the precomputed value in `seg[x]`. Otherwise, it splits the segment into two halves and recursively queries the left and right halves, returning the maximum value between the two results.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(i):
    [x, h] = dom[i][0:2]
    s = i
    e = n
    while e - s > 1:
        m = int((e + s) / 2)
        print('bs %d' % m)
        if dom[m][0] < x + h:
            s = m
        else:
            e = m
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))
    return func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input and performs a binary search to find the index `e` such that `dom[e][0] >= x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the first and second elements of `dom[i]`. After determining `e`, it calls `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is the length of the `dom` list, and returns the result of this function call. The function handles the case where no such `e` exists by setting `s` to `i` when the loop terminates. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that `i` is a valid index within the range of the `dom` list. If `i` is out of bounds, it would cause an error before the binary search begins. Additionally, the function does not explicitly check if `x + h` is greater than the maximum possible value in the `dom` list, which could lead to incorrect behavior if such a scenario arises.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
