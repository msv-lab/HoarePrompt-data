Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to consider the scenario where a domino is pushed beyond the end of the sequence of dominoes. For example, if the last domino in the sequence is pushed to the right, the code does not account for the fact that no additional dominoes should fall after the end of the sequence.

Here is a case that the code does not handle correctly:
- Suppose the input is:
  ```
  3
  0 5
  4 3
  7 2
  ```
- According to the problem description, if the first domino (at position 0 with height 5) is pushed to the right, the following dominoes should fall: the second domino (at position 4 with height 3) and the third domino (at position 7 with height 2). However, the code does not correctly handle the scenario where the first domino is pushed to the right, causing the second and third dominoes to fall, but then does not correctly account for the sequence ending after the third domino.

The provided code only considers the immediate effect of pushing a domino and does not properly manage the sequence of events when a domino is pushed beyond the last domino in the sequence. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
