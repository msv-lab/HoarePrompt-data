You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` appear to be related to segment tree operations, but they are not used appropriately to solve the problem. The main issue is with `func_4`, which is supposed to calculate the number of dominoes that would fall if the i-th domino is pushed to the right. However, the logic within `func_4` is flawed.

Here's a detailed explanation of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Range to Consider**: The logic inside `func_4` uses a binary search to find the farthest domino that could be affected by pushing the i-th domino. The current implementation incorrectly updates the search range (`s` and `e`) without considering the actual fall range of the domino.

2. **Incorrect Use of Segment Tree Functions**: The segment tree functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) are not used to accumulate the fall counts correctly. They seem to be set up for a range maximum query, but they are not being utilized in a way that would provide the necessary cumulative information.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a combination of sorting and sweep line technique. Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Sort the Dominoes by Their Coordinates**: This helps in processing them in order.
2. **Use a Sweep Line Approach**: Maintain a variable to track the end of the current fall region and update the count of falling dominoes as needed.

Given these issues, the provided code does not handle the problem correctly, hence the output is incorrect for some cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
