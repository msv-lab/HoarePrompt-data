You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and for each domino i, xi and hi are integers satisfying -10^8 ≤ xi ≤ 10^8 and 2 ≤ hi ≤ 10^8.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
    #The program reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns that list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns the list. This operation can handle lines containing any number of space-separated values. If the input line is empty, the function will still return an empty list. No error handling is included for non-space-separated inputs or other types of invalid input, which could result in a list containing individual characters instead of substrings.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer representing the index of the domino within the range [s, e), val is an integer representing the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, s and e are integers defining the current segment of the segment tree being updated, and x is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree.
def func_2(i, val, s, e, x):
    seg[x] = max(seg[x], val)
    if (e - s < 2) :
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is an integer representing the index of the domino within the range [s, e), `val` is an integer representing the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, `s` and `e` are integers defining the current segment of the segment tree being updated, `x` is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree, and `seg[x]` is updated to `max(seg[x], val). The difference between `e` and `s` is greater than or equal to 2
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if (i < m) :
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)
    else :
        func_2(i, val, m, e, 2 * x + 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is an integer representing the index of the domino within the range [s, e), `val` is an integer representing the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, `s` and `e` are integers defining the current segment of the segment tree being updated, `x` is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree, `seg[x]` is updated to `max(seg[x], val)`, `m = (e + s) / 2`. If `i` is less than `m`, the function updates the left child segment of the current node `x` and keeps `i` less than `m`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function updates the right child segment of the current node `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function updates a specific value in a segment tree. It accepts parameters `i`, `val`, `s`, `e`, and `x`, where `i` is the index of the domino within the range `[s, e)`, `val` is the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, `s` and `e` define the current segment of the segment tree being updated, and `x` is the current node index in the segment tree. The function updates the segment tree by recursively traversing the appropriate segments based on the index `i`.

The function ensures that the segment tree node at index `x` is updated to `max(seg[x], val)`.

Potential edge case: If the difference between `e` and `s` is less than 2, the function returns without updating the segment tree, as indicated by the comment.

Missing functionality: The function does not return any value, which aligns with the provided return postconditions. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `s` and `e` might not form a valid segment, though this would typically be handled by the caller ensuring valid inputs.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node x, l and r are integers representing the query range, and seg is a list representing the segment tree where seg[x] contains the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the segment represented by node x.
def func_3(x, s, e, l, r):
    print('infind %d %d-%d %d-%d' % (x, s, e, l, r))
    if (s >= r or e <= l) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node x, l and r are integers representing the query range, and seg is a list representing the segment tree where seg[x] contains the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the segment represented by node x. The start index s is less than the right boundary of the query range r and the end index e is greater than the left boundary of the query range l.
    print('passed')
    if (s == l and e == r or e - s < 2) :
        print('wtf? %d' % seg[x])
        return seg[x]
        #The program returns the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the segment represented by node x, which is stored in seg[x]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node x, l and r are integers representing the query range, and seg is a list representing the segment tree where seg[x] contains the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the segment represented by node x. The start index s is less than the right boundary of the query range r, the end index e is greater than the left boundary of the query range l, and either s is not equal to l or e is not equal to r or e - s is greater than or equal to 2
    m = (e + s) / 2
    return max(func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)), func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m,
    l), r))
    #`The program returns the maximum value between the results of two function calls: func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)) and func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m, l), r)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts five parameters: `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`. It returns the maximum number of dominoes that can fall within the specified query range `[l, r]` by using a segment tree. The function checks if the current segment `[s, e]` is outside the query range, in which case it returns 0. If the current segment exactly matches the query range or its size is too small, it returns the precomputed value in `seg[x]`. Otherwise, it splits the segment into two halves and recursively queries the left and right halves, returning the maximum value between the two results.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: dom is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [xi, hi], representing the coordinate and height of a domino, respectively. i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom). n is an integer representing the number of dominoes, which is also the length of the domino list.
def func_4(i):
    [x, h] = dom[i][0:2]
    s = i
    e = n
    while e - s > 1:
        m = int((e + s) / 2)
        
        print('bs %d' % m)
        
        if dom[m][0] < x + h:
            s = m
        else:
            e = m
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [x_i, h_i]; `i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ i < len(dom); `n` is the length of `dom`; `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`; `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`; `s` is the final value of `s`, which is equal to the index where the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h` is no longer satisfied, or `i` if no such index exists; `e` is the final value of `e`, which is equal to the index of the last comparison made; `m` is the final value of `m`, which is the midpoint of `s` and `e`; the loop terminates when `e - s` is no longer greater than 1.
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))
    return func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)
    #The program returns the result of the function call `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)` where `n` is the length of `dom`, `i` is the initial index, `e` is the final value of `e` which is the index of the last comparison made, and `1` and `0` are the first arguments passed to the function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input and performs a binary search to find the index `e` such that `dom[e][0] >= x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the first and second elements of `dom[i]`. After determining `e`, it calls `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is the length of the `dom` list, and returns the result of this function call. The function handles the case where no such `e` exists by setting `s` to `i` when the loop terminates. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that `i` is a valid index within the range of the `dom` list. If `i` is out of bounds, it would cause an error before the binary search begins. Additionally, the function does not explicitly check if `x + h` is greater than the maximum possible value in the `dom` list, which could lead to incorrect behavior if such a scenario arises.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
