Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Segment Tree Implementation**:
   - The segment tree is used to efficiently query the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from a given domino. However, the implementation of the segment tree is incomplete and lacks the necessary logic to correctly update and query the segment tree.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` updates the segment tree with the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from a given domino. However, the function does not correctly propagate the update through the segment tree. Specifically, the function should update the segment tree in a way that reflects the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the given domino and all subsequent dominoes that could be affected by this update.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function `func_3` queries the segment tree to find the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from a given domino. The implementation of `func_3` is incorrect because it does not properly handle the propagation of the maximum values through the segment tree. The function should return the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the given domino and all subsequent dominoes that could be affected by this query.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is intended to update the segment tree with the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from each domino and then query the segment tree to get the required output. However, the segment tree updates and queries are not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4
16 5
20 5
10 10
18 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3 1 4 1 
```

Actual Output (assuming the program is run as is):
The program will likely produce incorrect results due to the issues in the segment tree implementation. For instance, the segment tree might not correctly propagate the updates or queries, leading to incorrect counts of dominoes falling.

To fix the program, the segment tree should be properly implemented to ensure that updates and queries are handled correctly. Specifically, the segment tree should:
- Correctly update the segment tree when a domino is pushed to the right.
- Correctly query the segment tree to get the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from a given domino.

In conclusion, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described, hence it is incorrect.
