You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is interested in arranging dominoes. He is fed up with common dominoes and he uses the dominoes of different heights. He put n dominoes on the table along one axis, going from left to right. Every domino stands perpendicular to that axis so that the axis passes through the center of its base. The i-th domino has the coordinate xi and the height hi. Now Vasya wants to learn for every domino, how many dominoes will fall if he pushes it to the right. Help him do that. 

Consider that a domino falls if it is touched strictly above the base. In other words, the fall of the domino with the initial coordinate x and height h leads to the fall of all dominoes on the segment [x + 1, x + h - 1].

<image>

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) which is the number of dominoes. Then follow n lines containing two integers xi and hi ( - 108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108) each, which are the coordinate and height of every domino. No two dominoes stand on one point.

Output

Print n space-separated numbers zi — the number of dominoes that will fall if Vasya pushes the i-th domino to the right (including the domino itself).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` appear to be related to segment tree operations, but they are not used appropriately to solve the problem. The main issue is with `func_4`, which is supposed to calculate the number of dominoes that would fall if the i-th domino is pushed to the right. However, the logic within `func_4` is flawed.

Here's a detailed explanation of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Range to Consider**: The logic inside `func_4` uses a binary search to find the farthest domino that could be affected by pushing the i-th domino. The current implementation incorrectly updates the search range (`s` and `e`) without considering the actual fall range of the domino.

2. **Incorrect Use of Segment Tree Functions**: The segment tree functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) are not used to accumulate the fall counts correctly. They seem to be set up for a range maximum query, but they are not being utilized in a way that would provide the necessary cumulative information.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a combination of sorting and sweep line technique. Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Sort the Dominoes by Their Coordinates**: This helps in processing them in order.
2. **Use a Sweep Line Approach**: Maintain a variable to track the end of the current fall region and update the count of falling dominoes as needed.

Given these issues, the provided code does not handle the problem correctly, hence the output is incorrect for some cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

dom = []
n = int(func_1()[0])
for i in range(n):
    dom.append(func_1())
    dom[i].append(i)
    for j in range(len(dom[i])):
        dom[i][j] = int(dom[i][j])
dom.sort()
seg = 4 * n * [0]
res = n * [0]
inf = 1000 * 1000 * 100 + 10
indx = n
while indx > 0:
    indx -= 1
    res[indx] = [dom[indx][2], max(indx + 1, func_4(indx)), indx]
    print('res %d: %d' % (indx, res[indx][1]))
    func_2(indx, res[indx][1], 0, n, 1)
    log = ''
    for x in seg:
        log += str(x) + ' '
    print(log)
print(res)

for i in range(n):
    out += str(res[i][1] - res[i][2]) + ' '
print(out)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and for each domino i, xi and hi are integers satisfying -10^8 ≤ xi ≤ 10^8 and 2 ≤ hi ≤ 10^8.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().split()
    #The program reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns that list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns the list. This operation can handle lines containing any number of space-separated values. If the input line is empty, the function will still return an empty list. No error handling is included for non-space-separated inputs or other types of invalid input, which could result in a list containing individual characters instead of substrings.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer representing the index of the domino within the range [s, e), val is an integer representing the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, s and e are integers defining the current segment of the segment tree being updated, and x is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree.
def func_2(i, val, s, e, x):
    seg[x] = max(seg[x], val)
    if (e - s < 2) :
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` is an integer representing the index of the domino within the range [s, e), `val` is an integer representing the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, `s` and `e` are integers defining the current segment of the segment tree being updated, `x` is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree, and `seg[x]` is updated to `max(seg[x], val). The difference between `e` and `s` is greater than or equal to 2
    m = (e + s) / 2
    if (i < m) :
        func_2(i, val, s, m, 2 * x)
    else :
        func_2(i, val, m, e, 2 * x + 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`i` is an integer representing the index of the domino within the range [s, e), `val` is an integer representing the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, `s` and `e` are integers defining the current segment of the segment tree being updated, `x` is an integer representing the current node index in the segment tree, `seg[x]` is updated to `max(seg[x], val)`, `m = (e + s) / 2`. If `i` is less than `m`, the function updates the left child segment of the current node `x` and keeps `i` less than `m`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function updates the right child segment of the current node `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function updates a specific value in a segment tree. It accepts parameters `i`, `val`, `s`, `e`, and `x`, where `i` is the index of the domino within the range `[s, e)`, `val` is the new value to be updated in the segment tree node, `s` and `e` define the current segment of the segment tree being updated, and `x` is the current node index in the segment tree. The function updates the segment tree by recursively traversing the appropriate segments based on the index `i`.

The function ensures that the segment tree node at index `x` is updated to `max(seg[x], val)`.

Potential edge case: If the difference between `e` and `s` is less than 2, the function returns without updating the segment tree, as indicated by the comment.

Missing functionality: The function does not return any value, which aligns with the provided return postconditions. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `s` and `e` might not form a valid segment, though this would typically be handled by the caller ensuring valid inputs.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node x, l and r are integers representing the query range, and seg is a list representing the segment tree where seg[x] contains the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the segment represented by node x.
def func_3(x, s, e, l, r):
    print('infind %d %d-%d %d-%d' % (x, s, e, l, r))
    if (s >= r or e <= l) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node x, l and r are integers representing the query range, and seg is a list representing the segment tree where seg[x] contains the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the segment represented by node x. The start index s is less than the right boundary of the query range r and the end index e is greater than the left boundary of the query range l.
    print('passed')
    if (s == l and e == r or e - s < 2) :
        print('wtf? %d' % seg[x])
        return seg[x]
        #The program returns the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the segment represented by node x, which is stored in seg[x]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: x is an integer representing the index of the segment tree node, s and e are integers representing the start and end indices of the segment represented by the node x, l and r are integers representing the query range, and seg is a list representing the segment tree where seg[x] contains the maximum number of dominoes that can fall starting from the segment represented by node x. The start index s is less than the right boundary of the query range r, the end index e is greater than the left boundary of the query range l, and either s is not equal to l or e is not equal to r or e - s is greater than or equal to 2
    m = (e + s) / 2
    return max(func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)), func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m,
    l), r))
    #`The program returns the maximum value between the results of two function calls: func_3(2 * x, s, m, l, min(r, m)) and func_3(2 * x + 1, m, e, max(m, l), r)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts five parameters: `x`, `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`. It returns the maximum number of dominoes that can fall within the specified query range `[l, r]` by using a segment tree. The function checks if the current segment `[s, e]` is outside the query range, in which case it returns 0. If the current segment exactly matches the query range or its size is too small, it returns the precomputed value in `seg[x]`. Otherwise, it splits the segment into two halves and recursively queries the left and right halves, returning the maximum value between the two results.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: dom is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [xi, hi], representing the coordinate and height of a domino, respectively. i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom). n is an integer representing the number of dominoes, which is also the length of the domino list.
def func_4(i):
    [x, h] = dom[i][0:2]
    s = i
    e = n
    while e - s > 1:
        m = int((e + s) / 2)
        
        print('bs %d' % m)
        
        if dom[m][0] < x + h:
            s = m
        else:
            e = m
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [x_i, h_i]; `i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ i < len(dom); `n` is the length of `dom`; `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`; `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`; `s` is the final value of `s`, which is equal to the index where the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h` is no longer satisfied, or `i` if no such index exists; `e` is the final value of `e`, which is equal to the index of the last comparison made; `m` is the final value of `m`, which is the midpoint of `s` and `e`; the loop terminates when `e - s` is no longer greater than 1.
    print('find %d %d - %d %d' % (i, e, x, h))
    return func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)
    #The program returns the result of the function call `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)` where `n` is the length of `dom`, `i` is the initial index, `e` is the final value of `e` which is the index of the last comparison made, and `1` and `0` are the first arguments passed to the function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes an integer `i` as input and performs a binary search to find the index `e` such that `dom[e][0] >= x + h`, where `x` and `h` are the first and second elements of `dom[i]`. After determining `e`, it calls `func_3(1, 0, n, i, e)`, where `n` is the length of the `dom` list, and returns the result of this function call. The function handles the case where no such `e` exists by setting `s` to `i` when the loop terminates. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that `i` is a valid index within the range of the `dom` list. If `i` is out of bounds, it would cause an error before the binary search begins. Additionally, the function does not explicitly check if `x + h` is greater than the maximum possible value in the `dom` list, which could lead to incorrect behavior if such a scenario arises.
