The code initializes `m` to the integer value of the average of `e` and `s`. Given that `e` is equal to `n` and `s` is equal to `i`, the calculation for `m` is `int((n + i) / 2)`.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers `[xi, hi]`, `i` is an integer such that `0 <= i < len(dom)`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`, `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`, `s` is the value of `i`, `e` is equal to `n`, `m` is `int((n + i) / 2)`**
