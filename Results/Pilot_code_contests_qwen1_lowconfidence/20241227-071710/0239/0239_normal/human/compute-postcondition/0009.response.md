`e` is assigned the value of `m`. From the initial state, we know that `m` is equal to `int((n + i) / 2)`. The value of `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is the value of `s`. The first element of `dom[m]` is not less than `x + h`, which means the first element of `dom[int((n + i) / 2)]` is not less than `x + h`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [xi, hi], `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom), `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`, `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`, `s` is the value of `i`, `e` is equal to `int((n + i) / 2)`, `m` is `int((n + i) / 2)`, and `'bs %d'` (where `d` is the value of `e`) is printed. The first element of `dom[int((n + i) / 2)]` is not less than `x + h`.**
