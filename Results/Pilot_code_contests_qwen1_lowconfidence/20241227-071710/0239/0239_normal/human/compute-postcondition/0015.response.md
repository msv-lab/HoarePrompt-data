The code `e = m` assigns the value of `m` to `e`. Based on the initial state, `m` is equal to `int((n + i) / 2)`. Therefore, `e` now holds the value of `int((n + i) / 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers \([x_i, h_i]\); `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(dom)\); `n` is greater than \(i + 1\); `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`; `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`; `s` is the value of `i`; `e` is equal to `int((n + i) / 2)`; `m` is equal to `int((n + i) / 2)`; `'bs %d'` (where `d` is the value of `m`) is printed.**
