Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `e - s > 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, this condition must evaluate to `True`.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers `[xi, hi]`.
   - `i` is an integer such that `0 <= i < len(dom)`.
   - `n` is the length of the `dom` list.
   - `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`.
   - `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`.
   - `s` is the value of `i`.
   - `e` is equal to `n`.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustment**:
   - Currently, `s = i` and `e = n`.
   - For `e - s > 1` to be true, `n - i > 1`, which simplifies to `n > i + 1`.

Given that `s = i` and `e = n`, we need to ensure that `n` (which is `e`) is greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

**State:**
- `dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers `[xi, hi]`.
- `i` is an integer such that `0 <= i < len(dom)`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
- `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`.
- `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`.
- `s` is the value of `i`.
- `e` is equal to `n`.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [xi, hi]; `i` is an integer such that `0 <= i < len(dom)`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`; `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`; `s` is the value of `i`; `e` is equal to `n`**
