The variable `s` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so `s` is simply assigned the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [xi, hi]; `i` is an integer such that `0 <= i < len(dom)'; `n` is an integer representing the number of dominoes, which is also the length of the domino list; `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`; `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`; `s` is the value of `i`.**
