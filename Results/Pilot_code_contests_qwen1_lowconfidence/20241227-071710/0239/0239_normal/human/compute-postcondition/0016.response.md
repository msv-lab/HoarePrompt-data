Postcondition: ***`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers \([x_i, h_i]\); `i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(dom)\); `n` is greater than \(i + 1\); `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`; `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`; `s` is the value of `m`; `e` is equal to either `n` or `int((n + i) / 2)`, and must be such that `e - i > 1`; `m` is equal to `int((n + i) / 2)`; `'bs %d'` (where `d` is the value of `m`) is printed. If `dom[m][0] < x + h`, then `dom[m][0]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `dom[m][0]` is updated to `x + h`.***
