Postcondition: ***`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [x_i, h_i]; `i` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ i < len(dom); `n` must be at least 2 more than its current value; `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`; `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`; `s` is now equal to `m`; `e` is equal to either `n` or int((n + i) / 2), and must be such that `e - i > 1`; `m` is the new value of `m`, calculated as int((e + s) / 2); the print statement outputs 'bs %d' where `%d` is replaced by the value of `m`.***

This postcondition covers both cases within the if-else block, ensuring that the final state of the program variables is accurately described regardless of whether the if or else condition is met.
