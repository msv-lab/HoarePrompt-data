Postcondition: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [xi, hi], `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom), `n` must be greater than i + 1, `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`, `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`, `s` is the value of `i`, `e` is equal to `n`, `m` is `int((n + i) / 2)`, and 'bs %d' (where d is the value of `m`) is printed. The current value of `m` satisfies `dom[m][0] < x + h`.**
