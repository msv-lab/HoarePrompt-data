Postcondition: ***`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [xi, hi], `i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(dom), `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`, `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`, `s` is the value of `i`, `e` is equal to either `n` or `int((n + i) / 2)`, `m` is either `int((n + i) / 2)` or `n`, and `'bs %d'` (where `d` is the value of `m` or `e`) is printed. If `dom[m][0] < x + h`, then `m` is set to `int((n + i) / 2)`. Otherwise, `e` is set to `int((n + i) / 2)` and the first element of `dom[int((n + i) / 2)]` is not less than `x + h`.***
