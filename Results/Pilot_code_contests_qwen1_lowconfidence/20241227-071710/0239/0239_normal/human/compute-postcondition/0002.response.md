`e` is assigned the value of `n`, and the value of `n` is the length of the `dom` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [xi, hi]; `i` is an integer such that `0 <= i < len(dom)'; `n` is the length of the `dom` list; `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`; `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`; `s` is the value of `i`; `e` is equal to `n`.**
