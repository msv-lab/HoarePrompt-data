Output State: **`dom` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers [x_i, h_i]; `i` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ i < len(dom); `n` is the length of `dom`; `x` is the first element of `dom[i]`; `h` is the second element of `dom[i]`; `s` is the final value of `s`, which is equal to the index where the condition `dom[m][0] < x + h` is no longer satisfied, or `i` if no such index exists; `e` is the final value of `e`, which is equal to the index of the last comparison made; `m` is the final value of `m`, which is the midpoint of `s` and `e`; the loop terminates when `e - s` is no longer greater than 1.**
