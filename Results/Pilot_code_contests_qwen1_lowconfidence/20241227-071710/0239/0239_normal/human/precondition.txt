The function takes no input arguments. The input data is provided in the standard input stream, where the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), followed by n lines, each containing two integers xi and hi (-108 ≤ xi ≤ 108, 2 ≤ hi ≤ 108), representing the coordinate and height of each domino, respectively. No two dominoes stand on the same point.
