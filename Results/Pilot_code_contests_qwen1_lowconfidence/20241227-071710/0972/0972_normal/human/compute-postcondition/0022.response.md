Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive.
- `m` is at least 1.
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`.
- `ans` is a list.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`.
- `tem` is `mem[1]`.
- `mem[1]` is sorted.
- If the length of `tem` is greater than 2 and the third last tuple in `tem` has its first element present in either the last or the second last tuple in `tem`, `ans` remains empty. Otherwise, `ans` contains the new string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
2. **Current State**: After the previous iteration, `i` is set to 1. The loop will run until `i` reaches `m + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:
- **`i`**: Since the loop runs from `1` to `m`, after the first iteration (`i = 1`), the next value of `i` should be `2`.
- **`tem`**: The list `tem` is `mem[1]`, which is initially empty and gets populated within the loop. Since the exact contents of `tem` depend on the loop body, we cannot determine its contents without knowing the loop body. However, since the loop has just started, `tem` will be updated in the next iteration.
- **`ans`**: The state of `ans` depends on the condition mentioned. Since the loop has just started, we cannot know the state of `ans` yet, but it will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop has just started and `i` needs to be incremented to the next value, the state adjustment needed for the next iteration is as follows:

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list, `i` is 2, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is `mem[1]` (which may be updated in the next iteration), `mem[1]` is sorted.**

This state reflects that the loop has just started, and `i` is now 2, ready to proceed with the next iteration.
