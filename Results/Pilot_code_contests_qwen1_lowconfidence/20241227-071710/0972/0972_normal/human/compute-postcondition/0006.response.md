The code appends a tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` to the sublist in `mem` at index `int(a[1])`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive (unchanged).
- `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive (unchanged).
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists (unchanged structure, but a new element is appended to one of these lists).
- `ans` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).
- `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()` (its components are used in the code).

Let's denote `a` as a list where `a[1]` is an integer between 0 and `m` inclusive, `a[0]` is a string, and `a[-1]` is an integer.

After executing the line of code:
- The sublist in `mem` at index `int(a[1])` gets a new element appended to it, which is the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**.
