The code appends the string `'?'` to the list `ans`. This operation does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list containing `'?'`, `i` is 1, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is `mem[1]`, `mem[1]` is sorted, the length of `tem` is greater than 2, the third last tuple in `tem` has its first element present in either the last or the second last tuple in `tem`**
