The code `n, m = rints()` assigns the values from `rints()` to `n` and `m`. Since `rints()` is not a standard Python function, we assume it returns two integers. However, the exact values are not specified, so we can only state that `n` and `m` are assigned new values from this function.

The initial conditions are:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000
- n ≥ 2m

After executing `n, m = rints()`, these conditions must still hold. Therefore, the updated values of `n` and `m` will satisfy the given constraints.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `n` is between 2 and 100 000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10 000 inclusive, and `n` ≥ 2m**
