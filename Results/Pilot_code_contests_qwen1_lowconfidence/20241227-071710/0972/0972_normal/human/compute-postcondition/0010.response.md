Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive.
   - `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
   - `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists, and one of the sublists contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times using `for _ in range(n)`.

3. **Current Iteration End State:**
   - We need to determine what changes occur at the end of the current iteration for the loop to continue.

Given that the loop runs `n` times, the key variable here is `i`, which starts at 2. Each iteration increments `i` by 1. Therefore, at the end of the current iteration:
- `i` would be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2, making it 3.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `mem`, `ans`, and `a`) do not change based on the loop condition directly; they remain as they were before the loop started or after the previous iteration.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` and another sublist now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**
