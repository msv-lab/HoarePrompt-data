`mem[i].sort()` sorts the sublist `mem[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, the sublist `mem[3]` is sorted. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 3, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list, `i` is 3, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is equal to `mem[2]` and is sorted, `mem[3]` is sorted.**
