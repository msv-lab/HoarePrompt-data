Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 3, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list with an additional element either `'?'` or `' %s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])`, `i` is 3, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is now `mem[3]` and is sorted, `mem[3]` is sorted.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, ensuring that the overall state of the program variables is accurately described after the execution of the if-else block.
