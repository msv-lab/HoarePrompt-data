`a` is assigned the value returned by the function `rstrs()`. The function `rstrs()` returns a value, but since its exact nature (type and content) is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. However, we know that the value of `a` is what `rstrs()` returns.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` and another sublist now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` and another sublist now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**
