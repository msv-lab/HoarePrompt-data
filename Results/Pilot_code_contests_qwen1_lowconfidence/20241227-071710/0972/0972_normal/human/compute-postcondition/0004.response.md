State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates using `_` as the variable name, but this does not change the fact that the loop will run `n` times. Therefore, `i` (or an equivalent iterator variable) must start at 0 and increase with each iteration until it reaches `n`.

2. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `mem`, and `ans` are given. These do not need adjustment because they define the environment in which the loop operates.

3. Since the loop will run `n` times, `i` must start at 0 to ensure that the loop runs the correct number of times.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `i` is 0.
