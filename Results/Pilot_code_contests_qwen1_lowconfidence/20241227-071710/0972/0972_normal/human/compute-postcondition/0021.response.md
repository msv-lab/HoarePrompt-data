Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list, `i` is 1, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is `mem[1]`, `mem[1]` is sorted. If the length of `tem` is greater than 2 and the third last tuple in `tem` has its first element present in either the last or the second last tuple in `tem`, `ans` remains empty. Otherwise, `ans` contains the new string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])` appended to it.***
