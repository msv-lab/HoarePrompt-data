The code prints the contents of the `ans` list using `'\n'.join(ans)`. Since the content of `ans` is determined by the logic inside the loop, and no new values are assigned to `ans` in the given code snippet, the `ans` list remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output will be the joined string of the `ans` list as it was before this line of code was executed.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is a positive integer, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list containing strings either `'?'` or of the form `' %s %s' % (last_value, second_last_value)`, `i` is `m + 1`, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is `mem[m]` and is sorted, the contents of `ans` are printed.**
