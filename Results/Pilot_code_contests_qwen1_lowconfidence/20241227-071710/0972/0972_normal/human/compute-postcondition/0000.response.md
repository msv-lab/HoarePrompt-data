The provided code is a lambda function that reads a line from standard input and splits it into integers. It does not perform any operation that would change the values of the existing variables `n` and `m`. Instead, it defines a function that can be used later to read input data.

Given the initial state where `n` and `m` are integers with specified ranges, and this lambda function is defined, the output state remains the same as the initial state because no changes are made to `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, and n ≥ 2m**
