According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 0, it needs to be incremented to 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `n` remains unchanged, and `i` becomes 1.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**
