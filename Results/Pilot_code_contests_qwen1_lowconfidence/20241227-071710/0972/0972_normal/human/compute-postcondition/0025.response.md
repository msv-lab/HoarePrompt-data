`ans` is appended with the value `'?'`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The value of `a`, `tem`, `mem`, and other variables also remain unchanged since the code only appends a value to `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list with an additional element `'?'`, `i` is 2, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is equal to `mem[2]`, `mem[2]` is sorted**
