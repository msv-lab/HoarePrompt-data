The function `rstrs()` returns a value for `a`. However, since the exact return value of `rstrs()` is not specified in the initial state, we will denote the return value of `rstrs()` as `a`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 after the assignment.

The output state will be:
- `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive
- `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is 2 (since `i` is incremented by 1)
- `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**
