`tem` is assigned the value of `mem[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `tem` is now equal to `mem[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list, `i` is 2, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is equal to `mem[2]`, `mem[2]` is sorted.
