The code appends a formatted string to the `ans` list using the last and second-to-last elements from `tem`. Here, `tem` is `mem[2]` which is sorted. The previous state of `tem` is a list of tuples, each containing two elements.

Let's assume the last tuple in `tem` is `(last_value1, last_value2)` and the second-to-last tuple is `(second_last_value1, second_last_value2)`. 

After executing the line of code:
```python
ans.append('%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1]))
```
- `ans` will append a string formed by concatenating the second element of the last tuple and the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `tem`.

Since the exact contents of `tem` are not specified, we can denote the last and second-to-last tuples in `tem` as follows:
- Let `tem[-1]` be `(last_value1, last_value2)`
- Let `tem[-2]` be `(second_last_value1, second_last_value2)`

Thus, the appended string will be `'%s %s' % (last_value2, second_last_value2)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` contains the additional string `'%s %s' % (last_value2, second_last_value2)` where `last_value2` is the second element of the last tuple and `second_last_value2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `tem`, `i` is 2, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is equal to `mem[2]` and is sorted**.
