The code appends a formatted string to the `ans` list. The string is constructed using the last two elements of the list `tem`. Since `tem` is a subset of `mem[3]` and `mem[3]` is sorted, we know that `tem[-1][1]` and `tem[-2][1]` are the last and second-to-last elements of `tem`, respectively.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- `tem` is a list derived from `mem[3]` and is sorted.
- `ans` is a list that gets appended to.
- The new element in `ans` is the string formed by concatenating the first elements of the last two tuples in `tem`.

Since `tem` is sorted and contains tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, the last tuple in `tem` has the form `(last_value_of_a, last_element_of_a)`, and the second-to-last tuple has the form `(second_last_value_of_a, second_last_element_of_a)`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 3, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list with an additional element '%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1]), `i` is 3, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is now `mem[3]` and is sorted, `mem[3]` is sorted.**
