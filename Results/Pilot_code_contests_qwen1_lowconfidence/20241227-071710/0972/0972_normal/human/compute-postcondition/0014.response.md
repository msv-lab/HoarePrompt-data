According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop starts from `i = 1` and iterates up to `i = m + 1 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` should start at 1 and `m` should be at least 1.

Let's break it down:

1. The initial value of `i` is given as `n`, and `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive.
2. The loop condition is `i` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`.
3. For the loop to start, `i` must be set to 1 initially, and `m` must be at least 1.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` should be 1 (not `n`) and `m` should be at least 1.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**
