The code appends a tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` to the sublist in `mem` indexed by `int(a[1])`. Since `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `a` is a list. The last element of `a` is `a[-1]` and the second element of `a` is `a[1]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive
- `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` and another sublist now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is 3
- `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`

After executing the line `mem[int(a[1])].append((int(a[-1]), a[0]))`, the sublist in `mem` indexed by `int(a[1])` will have an additional tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` and another sublist now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` and a new tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**
