The code initializes two variables: `mem` and `ans`. 

- `mem` is a list of lists, created using a list comprehension. It consists of `m + 1` empty lists. Given that `m` is between 1 and 10,000, `mem` will have `m + 1` elements, each being an empty list.
- `ans` is an empty list.

The initial values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignments made.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists, `ans` is an empty list**
