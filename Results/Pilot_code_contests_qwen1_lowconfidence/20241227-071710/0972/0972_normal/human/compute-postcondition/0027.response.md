Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list, `i` is 2, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is equal to `mem[2]` and is sorted. If `len(tem) > 2` and the third last element's first value is the same as either the last or second last element's first value, `ans` is a list with an additional element `'?'`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the additional string `'%s %s' % (last_value2, second_last_value2)` where `last_value2` is the second element of the last tuple and `second_last_value2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `tem`.***
