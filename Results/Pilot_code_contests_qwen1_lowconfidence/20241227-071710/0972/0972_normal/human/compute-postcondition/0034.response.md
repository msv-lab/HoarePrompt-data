Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is a positive integer, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list containing strings either `'?'` or of the form `' %s %s' % (last_value, second_last_value)`, `i` is `m + 1`, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is `mem[m]` and is sorted. For every iteration, if `len(tem) > 2` and the third last tuple's first element is the same as either the last or second last tuple's first element, `ans` contains `'?'` appended. Otherwise, `ans` contains the string `' %s %s' % (last_value, second_last_value)` where `last_value` is the second element of the last tuple and `second_last_value` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `tem`.**
