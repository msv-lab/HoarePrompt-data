`mem[i]` is sorted. Since `i` is 1, we are sorting the first sublist in `mem`. The sublist contains tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`. The sorting is done based on the first element of each tuple, which is `int(a[-1])`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `mem[1]` is sorted.
