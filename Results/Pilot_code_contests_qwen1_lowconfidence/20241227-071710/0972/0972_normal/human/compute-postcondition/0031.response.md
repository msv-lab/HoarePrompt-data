The code `ans.append('?')` appends the string `'?'` to the list `ans`. No other variables are affected. The initial conditions remain unchanged except for `ans`, which now includes the appended element.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 3, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list with an additional element `'?'`, `i` is 3, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is now `mem[3]` and is sorted, `mem[3]` is sorted.**
