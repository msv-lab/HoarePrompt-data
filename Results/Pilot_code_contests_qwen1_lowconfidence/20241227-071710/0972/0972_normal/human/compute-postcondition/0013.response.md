Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The loop runs exactly `n` times, so `i` (which starts at 0) will be incremented `n` times, making `i` equal to `n`.
- **`m`**: This variable remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
- **`mem`**: Each sublist in `mem` will contain zero or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`. Since the loop iterates `n` times, each sublist will have at least one such tuple, but potentially more depending on the input to `rstrs()`.
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` remains empty as the loop does not modify it.
- **`i`**: This variable starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. After `n` iterations, `i` will be `n`.
- **`a`**: This variable is the return value of the function `rstrs()` called in each iteration of the loop. The exact value of `a` is not specified, but it follows the format described in the loop body.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state of the variables will reflect these conditions.
