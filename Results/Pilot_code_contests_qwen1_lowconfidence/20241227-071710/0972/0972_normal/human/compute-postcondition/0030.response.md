The code `tem = mem[i]` assigns the value of `mem[i]` to the variable `tem`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `tem` will now hold the value of `mem[3]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 3, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list, `i` is 3, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is now `mem[3]` and is sorted, `mem[3]` is sorted.**
