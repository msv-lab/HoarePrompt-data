The given code defines a lambda function `rstrs` that reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each element in the list to a string. However, this function does not execute any logic that changes the values of `n` or `m`. It only defines the function itself.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, and n ≥ 2m**
