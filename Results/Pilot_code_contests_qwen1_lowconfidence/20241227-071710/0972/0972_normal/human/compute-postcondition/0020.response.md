`ans.append('%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1]))` appends a formatted string to the list `ans`. This string is composed of the second last element's first tuple item and the last element's first tuple item from the list `tem`. Since `tem` is derived from `mem[1]`, and `mem[1]` is sorted and its length is less than or equal to 2 or the last three elements do not include the same first element as the last two or last element, the list `tem` can have at most 2 elements.

If `tem` has exactly one element, the string would be empty because there would be no second last element to reference. If `tem` has exactly two elements, the string will be formed using those two elements. Therefore, after the code executes, `ans` will have a new string appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` contains the new string `'%s %s' % (tem[-1][1], tem[-2][1])` appended to it, `i` is 1, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is `mem[1]`, `mem[1]` is sorted, and the length of `tem` is less than or equal to 2 or the last three elements of `tem` do not include the same first element as the last two or last element.**
