Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive.
- `m` is at least 1.
- `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`.
- `ans` is a list.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`.
- `tem` is equal to `mem[2]` and is sorted.
- If `len(tem) > 2` and the third last element's first value is the same as either the last or second last element's first value, `ans` is a list with an additional element `'?'`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the additional string `'%s %s' % (last_value2, second_last_value2)` where `last_value2` is the second element of the last tuple and `second_last_value2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `tem`.

### Loop Information
```
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
The loop starts with `i = 2` and will continue as long as `i < m + 1`.

#### Current Values:
- `i` is currently 2.
- The loop needs to increment `i` by 1 to continue.

#### Conditions for Continuing the Loop:
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m + 1`.

### State Adjustments
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `3`.
- `m` remains unchanged.

### Additional Considerations
- Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust any other variables based on the loop execution itself. However, we should ensure that the loop can continue based on the condition `i < m + 1`.

### Final State
Given that the loop condition is `i < m + 1` and `i` is currently 2, the loop can execute one more time if `m` is at least 3.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 3, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list, `i` is 3, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is equal to `mem[2]` and is sorted.**

This ensures that the loop can continue executing as long as `i < m + 1`.
