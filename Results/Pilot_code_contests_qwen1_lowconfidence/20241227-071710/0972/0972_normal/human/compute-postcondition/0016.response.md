`tem` is assigned the value of `mem[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `tem` becomes `mem[1]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is `mem[1]`, `mem[1]` is sorted**
