The code appends a tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` to the sublist in `mem` at the index `int(a[1])`. Let's break this down:

- `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, but its exact content is not specified. However, we know `a` is a list with at least two elements since `a[1]` and `a[-1]` are being referenced.
- `int(a[1])` gives the index in `mem` where the tuple will be appended.
- `int(a[-1])` and `a[0]` form the tuple to be appended.

Given the initial state, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists, and one of these sublists now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`. After executing the code, the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` will be added to the sublist in `mem` at the index `int(a[1])`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where one of the sublists contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])` and another sublist now contains the tuple `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**
