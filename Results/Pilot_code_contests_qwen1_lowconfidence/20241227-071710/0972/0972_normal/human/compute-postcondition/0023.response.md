The code `mem[i].sort()` sorts the sublist `mem[i]`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 2, so `mem[2]` is sorted. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is at least 1, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists where each sublist contains one or more tuples of the form `(int(a[-1]), a[0])`, `ans` is a list, `i` is 2, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`, `tem` is `mem[1]` (which may be updated in the next iteration), `mem[2]` is sorted.**
