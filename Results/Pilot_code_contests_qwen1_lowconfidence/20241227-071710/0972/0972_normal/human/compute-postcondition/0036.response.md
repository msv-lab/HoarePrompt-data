The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it processes the input data, which consists of n lines, each describing a participant with a surname (a string of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), a region number (an integer from 1 to m), and the number of points scored by the participant (an integer from 0 to 800, inclusive). Each region has at least two participants.

The function does not return a value directly but rather processes the input data according to the given constraints. However, based on the provided output cases, it seems the function might return information about regions, participants, or some aggregated result related to the input data.

Given the structure of the problem, the function likely returns information about the regions or participants after processing the input data. Since no specific return value is mentioned, we can summarize the functionality as:

Functionality: **The function processes input data consisting of n lines, each describing a participant, and returns information related to regions or participants based on the given constraints.**
