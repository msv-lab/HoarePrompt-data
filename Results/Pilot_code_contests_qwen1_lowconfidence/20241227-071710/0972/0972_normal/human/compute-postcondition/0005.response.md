The code snippet `a = rstrs()` assigns the value returned by the function `rstrs()` to the variable `a`. However, since the function `rstrs()` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. We only know that `a` will hold the value returned by this function.

Other variables remain unchanged: `n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100,000 inclusive, `m` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, `mem` is a list of `m + 1` empty lists, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a` is the value returned by `rstrs()`**
