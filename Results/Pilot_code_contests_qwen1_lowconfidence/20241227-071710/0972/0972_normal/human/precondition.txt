There are two lists of strings and integers representing participants' surnames and their scores, and two integers n and m such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, and n ≥ 2m. Each participant is represented by their surname (a string of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), the region number (an integer from 1 to m), and the number of points scored (an integer from 0 to 800, inclusive). At least two participants are from each region, and all surnames are distinct.
