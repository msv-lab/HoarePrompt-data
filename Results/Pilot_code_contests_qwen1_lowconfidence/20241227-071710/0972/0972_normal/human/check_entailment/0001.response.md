Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple teams can be formed uniquely but choosing the wrong pair. According to the problem description, if there are multiple valid teams for a region, the output should be `?`. However, the current implementation only checks if the third-highest score is the same as the highest or second-highest score, which is not sufficient to ensure that no other valid pairs exist.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 800
Semenov 2 503
```

In this case, region 1 has three students with the highest score of 800. The program will output:

```
Ivanov Petrov
Andreev Semenov
```

This is incorrect because there are multiple valid teams, and the output should be `?` for region 1. The program needs to check if there are multiple valid teams by ensuring that the highest score is not the only unique score among the top three scores.
