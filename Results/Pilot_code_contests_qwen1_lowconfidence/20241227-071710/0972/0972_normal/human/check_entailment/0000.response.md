Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the team members for each region based on the given problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the third-highest score is equal to the highest or second-highest score, which is not sufficient to determine if the team is uniquely defined.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5 2
Ivanov 1 800
Andreev 2 763
Petrov 1 800
Sidorov 1 800
Semenov 2 503
```

According to the problem description, the team in region 1 should be indeterminate because there are multiple pairs of students (Ivanov, Sidorov), (Ivanov, Petrov), and (Petrov, Sidorov) that both have the highest score of 800. However, the program incorrectly outputs "?":

```
?
Andreev Semenov
```

The program fails to handle cases where there are multiple valid teams that meet the criteria. It only checks if the third-highest score matches the highest or second-highest score, which is insufficient for determining if the team is uniquely defined.
