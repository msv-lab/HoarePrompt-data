Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly determine the team from each region based on the problem description. Specifically, the logic for identifying the team does not fully adhere to the requirement that no member of a team can be replaced by another participant from the same region who scored higher points. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program fails:

1. **Sorting Logic**:
   - The program sorts the participants within each region based on their scores in descending order (`mem[i].sort()`).
   - It then checks if the third highest score is the same as the highest or second-highest score (`if len(tem) > 2 and tem[-3][0] in (tem[-1][0], tem[-2][0]):`).
   - If this condition is met, it appends `'?'` to the answer list `ans`.

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if len(tem) > 2 and tem[-3][0] in (tem[-1][0], tem[-2][0]):` is flawed because it checks if the third highest score is the same as the highest or second-highest score. However, this does not guarantee that the top two scorers cannot be replaced by higher-scoring participants from the same region.
   - For example, consider the following scenario:
     - Region 1: Participant A (800), Participant B (799), Participant C (798), Participant D (797)
     - The sorted list would be `[800, 799, 798, 797]`
     - According to the current logic, the program would check if `798` is equal to `800` or `799`. Since `798` is not equal to `800` or `799`, the program would return the top two scorers, which is correct. However, this does not handle the case where the second-highest scorer could potentially be replaced by a higher scorer.

3. **Handling of Ties**:
   - The program assumes that the top two scorers cannot be replaced by higher scorers if they are the only two distinct scores among the top three. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that no participant can be replaced.
   - For example, if there are multiple participants with the same highest score and the next highest score is also the same, the program might incorrectly determine the team.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the team, the program should ensure that no participant in the team can be replaced by a higher-scoring participant from the same region. One way to achieve this is by checking all possible pairs of participants in the region and ensuring that no other participant can replace either of them.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    participants = defaultdict(list)
    
    for _ in range(n):
        surname, region, score = input().split()
        participants[region].append((-int(score), surname))
    
    for region in range(1, m + 1):
        participants[region].sort()
        
        if len(participants[region]) < 2:
            print('?')
            continue
        
        team = []
        for score, surname in participants[region]:
            if not team or all(team[0][0] <= -score and team[1][0] <= -score):
                team.append((-score, surname))
            if len(team) == 2:
                break
        
        if len(team) == 2:
            print(' '.join(team[1][1], team[0][1]))
        else:
            print('?')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Mapping Participants to Regions**:
   - Use a dictionary to map each region to a list of participants sorted by their scores in descending order.

2. **Forming Teams**:
   - For each region, sort the participants.
   - Iterate through the sorted participants and check if adding the current participant to the team is valid (i.e., no higher-scoring participant can replace any member of the team).
   - If a valid team of two participants is found, print their surnames.
   - If no valid team can be formed, print `'?'`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the team according to the problem description.
