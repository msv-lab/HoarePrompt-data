n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, and n ≥ 2m. The input consists of n lines, each describing a participant with a surname (a string of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), a region number (an integer from 1 to m), and the number of points scored by the participant (an integer from 0 to 800, inclusive). Each region has at least two participants.
