The function reads three integers from standard input (stdin), representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k), and returns them as a list. There are no parameters passed to the function. The function does not perform any additional operations on the input values beyond reading and returning them as a list. The function handles the case where the input format is incorrect (e.g., fewer than three integers or non-integer values), as `map(int, ...)` will raise a `ValueError` in such cases. If the input is correctly formatted, the function will return a list `[n, m, k]`. If the input is invalid, an exception will be raised.
