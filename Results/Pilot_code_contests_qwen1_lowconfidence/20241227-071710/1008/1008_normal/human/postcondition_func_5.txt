The function accepts no parameters and performs the following actions: It first initializes a list `store` containing all coordinates in a grid of size `rows` by `cols`. It then prints a sequence of coordinates from `store` in a specific pattern. Specifically, it prints the first two coordinates from `store` repeatedly until `k-1` times have been printed, followed by the remaining coordinates in `store` in a linear sequence. The function ensures that the total number of printed coordinates is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`. This process involves iterating over the grid in a zigzag manner and printing pairs of coordinates alternately in forward and backward directions. The function covers the case where `k` is at least 2 and handles the grid dimensions within the specified limits (2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2 * k ≤ rows * cols).
