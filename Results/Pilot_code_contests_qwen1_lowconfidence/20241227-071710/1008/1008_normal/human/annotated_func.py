#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_1()` are described in the problem statement or the function itself. The function reads input from stdin and returns an iterator of integers representing the dimensions of the table (n, m, k), where n and m are the number of rows and columns respectively, and k is the number of tubes.
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns an iterator of integers representing the dimensions of the table (n, m, k), where n and m are the number of rows and columns respectively, and k is the number of tubes, read from stdin
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` reads input from standard input (stdin) in the form of a space-separated line of integers. It then splits this input into individual integers and converts them to a list of integers, which it returns as an iterator. This iterator represents the dimensions of a table, specifically the number of rows (`n`), the number of columns (`m`), and the number of tubes (`k`). The function assumes that the input is always in the correct format (three space-separated integers). If the input does not conform to this format, the function may raise a `ValueError` due to incorrect conversion of the input string to integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters. It reads input from stdin, which consists of three space-separated integers representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k), respectively.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    #The program returns a list of three integers read from stdin, representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k) respectively
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers from standard input (stdin), representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k), and returns them as a list. There are no parameters passed to the function. The function does not perform any additional operations on the input values beyond reading and returning them as a list. The function handles the case where the input format is incorrect (e.g., fewer than three integers or non-integer values), as `map(int, ...)` will raise a `ValueError` in such cases. If the input is correctly formatted, the function will return a list `[n, m, k]`. If the input is invalid, an exception will be raised.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided in the given code snippet. The function does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads a single line from standard input (stdin). It then strips any trailing whitespace from the input line and returns the resulting string. This process covers all potential cases where the input line may contain trailing spaces, and it ensures that the returned value is free of such spaces.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, and at least one of them is positive.
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'x' is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of 'x' and 'y', 'y' is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, given y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, where at least one of them is positive. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. 

Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is 0 initially, in which case the function still correctly computes the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will enter an infinite loop because the condition `while y:` will always be true. Therefore, the function should handle this case by raising an exception or returning a specific value to indicate an invalid input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n*m.
def func_5(x, y):
    return x * y // func_4(x, y)
    #The program returns the integer division of x * y by the result of func_4(x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5(x, y)` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` (with constraints 2 ≤ x, y ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ x*y). It calculates the integer division of `x * y` by the result of calling another function `func_4(x, y)`. The function returns an integer result. Potential edge cases include when `func_4(x, y)` returns 0, which would cause a division by zero error, and when `x * y` is less than `func_4(x, y)`, resulting in a non-positive integer division.

    print(rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1), end=' ')
    while i < rows * cols:
        if i == rows * cols - 1:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and performs the following actions: It first initializes a list `store` containing all coordinates in a grid of size `rows` by `cols`. It then prints a sequence of coordinates from `store` in a specific pattern. Specifically, it prints the first two coordinates from `store` repeatedly until `k-1` times have been printed, followed by the remaining coordinates in `store` in a linear sequence. The function ensures that the total number of printed coordinates is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`. This process involves iterating over the grid in a zigzag manner and printing pairs of coordinates alternately in forward and backward directions. The function covers the case where `k` is at least 2 and handles the grid dimensions within the specified limits (2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2 * k ≤ rows * cols).
