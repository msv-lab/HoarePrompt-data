The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, where at least one of them is positive. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. 

Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is 0 initially, in which case the function still correctly computes the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will enter an infinite loop because the condition `while y:` will always be true. Therefore, the function should handle this case by raising an exception or returning a specific value to indicate an invalid input.
