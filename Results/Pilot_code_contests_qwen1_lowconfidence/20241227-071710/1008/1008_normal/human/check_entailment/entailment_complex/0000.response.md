Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not cover all potential cases described in the problem description. Specifically, the code does not ensure that each cell of the table belongs to some tube and no pair of tubes has common cells. The code simply prints coordinates in a zigzag manner without checking for these conditions. For example, consider a 2x3 table with 2 tubes:

- Input: `2 3 2`
- Expected output (one possible solution): 
```
3 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 2 1
3 2 1 3 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 2
```

However, the given code will produce output that does not necessarily satisfy the conditions mentioned in the problem description. For instance, it might print coordinates in a way that violates the requirement that each cell belongs to exactly one tube and no two tubes share any cells. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
