Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by arranging tubes on a rectangular table in a manner that satisfies the given conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `curr_x` and `curr_y` to 0 and sets up a `turn` variable to alternate between moving right and left across columns.
2. **Tube Placement Logic**: It iterates through each row, placing tubes either from left to right or right to left depending on the value of `turn`. This ensures that each cell is visited exactly once.
3. **Output Generation**: The program prints the number of cells in each tube and the coordinates of those cells. It alternates between two cells per line for the first `k-1` tubes and handles the remaining cells in the last tube.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach should cover all cases where it's possible to arrange the tubes as described. Since the program guarantees that each cell belongs to exactly one tube and no two tubes share any cells, and considering the problem's constraints (2 ≤ n, m, 2k ≤ n·m), the program should work for all valid inputs.

Thus, based on the given problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
