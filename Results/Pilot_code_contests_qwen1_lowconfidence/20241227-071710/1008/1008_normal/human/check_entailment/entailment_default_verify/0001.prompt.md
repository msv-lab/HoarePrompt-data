You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valera has got a rectangle table consisting of n rows and m columns. Valera numbered the table rows starting from one, from top to bottom and the columns – starting from one, from left to right. We will represent cell that is on the intersection of row x and column y by a pair of integers (x, y).

Valera wants to place exactly k tubes on his rectangle table. A tube is such sequence of table cells (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xr, yr), that: 

  * r ≥ 2; 
  * for any integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ r - 1) the following equation |xi - xi + 1| + |yi - yi + 1| = 1 holds; 
  * each table cell, which belongs to the tube, must occur exactly once in the sequence. 



Valera thinks that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * no pair of tubes has common cells; 
  * each cell of the table belongs to some tube. 



Help Valera to arrange k tubes on his rectangle table in a fancy manner.

Input

The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m, k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300; 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of tubes, correspondingly. 

Output

Print k lines. In the i-th line print the description of the i-th tube: first print integer ri (the number of tube cells), then print 2ri integers xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2, ..., xiri, yiri (the sequence of table cells).

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to place \(k\) tubes on an \(n \times m\) table in a fancy manner by iterating through the table in a zigzag pattern and dividing the cells into \(k\) tubes. Here’s a breakdown of why this approach works:

1. **Zigzag Pattern**: The program iterates through the table in a zigzag manner, ensuring that each cell is visited exactly once. This guarantees that each cell belongs to exactly one tube.

2. **Tubes Construction**: For each tube, it takes two consecutive cells from the zigzag traversal. This ensures that the tubes do not overlap and cover the entire table.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the boundary conditions well by reversing the direction when reaching the end of a row. This ensures that the entire table is covered without any overlaps.

Given these points, the program appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 6 : The function accepts no parameters and performs the following actions: It first initializes a list `store` containing all coordinates in a grid of size `rows` by `cols`. It then prints a sequence of coordinates from `store` in a specific pattern. Specifically, it prints the first two coordinates from `store` repeatedly until `k-1` times have been printed, followed by the remaining coordinates in `store` in a linear sequence. The function ensures that the total number of printed coordinates is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`. This process involves iterating over the grid in a zigzag manner and printing pairs of coordinates alternately in forward and backward directions. The function covers the case where `k` is at least 2 and handles the grid dimensions within the specified limits (2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2 * k ≤ rows * cols).+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
