You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valera has got a rectangle table consisting of n rows and m columns. Valera numbered the table rows starting from one, from top to bottom and the columns – starting from one, from left to right. We will represent cell that is on the intersection of row x and column y by a pair of integers (x, y).

Valera wants to place exactly k tubes on his rectangle table. A tube is such sequence of table cells (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xr, yr), that: 

  * r ≥ 2; 
  * for any integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ r - 1) the following equation |xi - xi + 1| + |yi - yi + 1| = 1 holds; 
  * each table cell, which belongs to the tube, must occur exactly once in the sequence. 



Valera thinks that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * no pair of tubes has common cells; 
  * each cell of the table belongs to some tube. 



Help Valera to arrange k tubes on his rectangle table in a fancy manner.

Input

The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m, k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300; 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of tubes, correspondingly. 

Output

Print k lines. In the i-th line print the description of the i-th tube: first print integer ri (the number of tube cells), then print 2ri integers xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2, ..., xiri, yiri (the sequence of table cells).

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. 

Examples

Input

3 3 3

3 1 1 1 2 1 3
3 2 1 2 2 2 3
3 3 1 3 2 3 3


Input

2 3 1


Output

6 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 2 2 1

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to place \(k\) tubes on an \(n \times m\) table in a fancy manner by iterating through the table in a zigzag pattern and dividing the cells into \(k\) tubes. Here’s a breakdown of why this approach works:

1. **Zigzag Pattern**: The program iterates through the table in a zigzag manner, ensuring that each cell is visited exactly once. This guarantees that each cell belongs to exactly one tube.

2. **Tubes Construction**: For each tube, it takes two consecutive cells from the zigzag traversal. This ensures that the tubes do not overlap and cover the entire table.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the boundary conditions well by reversing the direction when reaching the end of a row. This ensures that the entire table is covered without any overlaps.

Given these points, the program appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
