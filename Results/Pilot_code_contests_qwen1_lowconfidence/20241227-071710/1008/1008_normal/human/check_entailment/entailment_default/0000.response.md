Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly place tubes on the rectangle table such that each cell belongs to exactly one tube and no tubes overlap. The code generates a sequence of coordinates in a zigzag manner, but it does not ensure that exactly `k` tubes are formed, nor does it ensure that each cell belongs to exactly one tube. Instead, it simply prints out a sequence of coordinates without adhering to the constraints of forming `k` non-overlapping tubes. This results in an incorrect solution to the problem.
