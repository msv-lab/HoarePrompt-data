Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_6` correctly constructs and prints the required tubes in a fancy manner. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Initialization and Storage**: The program initializes a list `store` that contains all coordinates of the table in a zigzag manner. This ensures that every cell is visited exactly once.

2. **Tube Construction**: The program constructs tubes by printing pairs of coordinates from `store`. It prints the first two coordinates, then skips the next pair, and continues this pattern until `k-1` tubes are printed. After that, it prints the remaining coordinates in a linear sequence.

3. **Coverage and Non-overlapping**: The zigzag pattern ensures that each cell is part of exactly one tube, and the construction method ensures that no cells are shared between tubes.

4. **Correct Output Format**: The program outputs the tubes in the required format, with each tube starting with the number of cells in the tube followed by the coordinates.

Given these points and the annotations, the program correctly arranges \(k\) tubes on the \(n \times m\) table in a fancy manner, meeting all the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
