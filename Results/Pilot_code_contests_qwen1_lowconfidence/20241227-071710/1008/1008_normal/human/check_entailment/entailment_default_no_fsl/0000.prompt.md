You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valera has got a rectangle table consisting of n rows and m columns. Valera numbered the table rows starting from one, from top to bottom and the columns – starting from one, from left to right. We will represent cell that is on the intersection of row x and column y by a pair of integers (x, y).

Valera wants to place exactly k tubes on his rectangle table. A tube is such sequence of table cells (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xr, yr), that: 

  * r ≥ 2; 
  * for any integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ r - 1) the following equation |xi - xi + 1| + |yi - yi + 1| = 1 holds; 
  * each table cell, which belongs to the tube, must occur exactly once in the sequence. 



Valera thinks that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * no pair of tubes has common cells; 
  * each cell of the table belongs to some tube. 



Help Valera to arrange k tubes on his rectangle table in a fancy manner.

Input

The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m, k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300; 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of tubes, correspondingly. 

Output

Print k lines. In the i-th line print the description of the i-th tube: first print integer ri (the number of tube cells), then print 2ri integers xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2, ..., xiri, yiri (the sequence of table cells).

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.

    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1()` reads input from standard input (stdin) in the form of a space-separated line of integers. It then splits this input into individual integers and converts them to a list of integers, which it returns as an iterator. This iterator represents the dimensions of a table, specifically the number of rows (`n`), the number of columns (`m`), and the number of tubes (`k`). The function assumes that the input is always in the correct format (three space-separated integers). If the input does not conform to this format, the function may raise a `ValueError` due to incorrect conversion of the input string to integers.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads three integers from standard input (stdin), representing the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the number of tubes (k), and returns them as a list. There are no parameters passed to the function. The function does not perform any additional operations on the input values beyond reading and returning them as a list. The function handles the case where the input format is incorrect (e.g., fewer than three integers or non-integer values), as `map(int, ...)` will raise a `ValueError` in such cases. If the input is correctly formatted, the function will return a list `[n, m, k]`. If the input is invalid, an exception will be raised.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and reads a single line from standard input (stdin). It then strips any trailing whitespace from the input line and returns the resulting string. This process covers all potential cases where the input line may contain trailing spaces, and it ensures that the returned value is free of such spaces.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, where at least one of them is positive. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. The function iteratively updates `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `x % y` until `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function then returns `x`. 

Potential edge cases include when either `x` or `y` is 0 initially, in which case the function still correctly computes the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will enter an infinite loop because the condition `while y:` will always be true. Therefore, the function should handle this case by raising an exception or returning a specific value to indicate an invalid input.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(x, y):
    return x * y // func_4(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5(x, y)` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` (with constraints 2 ≤ x, y ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ x*y). It calculates the integer division of `x * y` by the result of calling another function `func_4(x, y)`. The function returns an integer result. Potential edge cases include when `func_4(x, y)` returns 0, which would cause a division by zero error, and when `x * y` is less than `func_4(x, y)`, resulting in a non-positive integer division.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (rows, cols, k) = func_1()
    curr_x = curr_y = 0
    turn = 0
    store = []
    for i in range(rows):
        if not turn:
            for j in range(cols):
                store.append([i + 1, j + 1])
        else:
            for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
                store.append([i + 1, j + 1])
        turn ^= 1
    i = 0
    count = 0
    while count < k - 1:
        print(2, end=' ')
        print(*store[i], end=' ')
        print(*store[i + 1])
        i += 2
        count += 1
    print(rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1), end=' ')
    while i < rows * cols:
        if i == rows * cols - 1:
            print(*store[i])
        else:
            print(*store[i], end=' ')
        i += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function accepts no parameters and performs the following actions: It first initializes a list `store` containing all coordinates in a grid of size `rows` by `cols`. It then prints a sequence of coordinates from `store` in a specific pattern. Specifically, it prints the first two coordinates from `store` repeatedly until `k-1` times have been printed, followed by the remaining coordinates in `store` in a linear sequence. The function ensures that the total number of printed coordinates is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`. This process involves iterating over the grid in a zigzag manner and printing pairs of coordinates alternately in forward and backward directions. The function covers the case where `k` is at least 2 and handles the grid dimensions within the specified limits (2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2 * k ≤ rows * cols).



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
