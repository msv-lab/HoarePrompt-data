The function `func_1()` reads input from standard input (stdin) in the form of a space-separated line of integers. It then splits this input into individual integers and converts them to a list of integers, which it returns as an iterator. This iterator represents the dimensions of a table, specifically the number of rows (`n`), the number of columns (`m`), and the number of tubes (`k`). The function assumes that the input is always in the correct format (three space-separated integers). If the input does not conform to this format, the function may raise a `ValueError` due to incorrect conversion of the input string to integers.
