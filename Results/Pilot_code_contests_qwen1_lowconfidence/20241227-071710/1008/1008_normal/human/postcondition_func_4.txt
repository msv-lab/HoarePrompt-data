The function `func_5(x, y)` accepts two positive integers `x` and `y` (with constraints 2 ≤ x, y ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ x*y). It calculates the integer division of `x * y` by the result of calling another function `func_4(x, y)`. The function returns an integer result. Potential edge cases include when `func_4(x, y)` returns 0, which would cause a division by zero error, and when `x * y` is less than `func_4(x, y)`, resulting in a non-positive integer division.
