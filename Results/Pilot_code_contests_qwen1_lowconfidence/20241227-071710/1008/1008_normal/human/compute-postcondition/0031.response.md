Postcondition: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and `store` contains either the list `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 0.**
