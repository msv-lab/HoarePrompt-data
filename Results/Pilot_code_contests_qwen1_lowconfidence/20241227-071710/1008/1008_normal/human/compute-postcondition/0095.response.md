The code `print(*store[i])` prints the elements of the list stored at index `i` of the `store` list. However, the initial state does not specify what `store` is, and no new values are assigned to `total`, `i`, `count`, or `k`. Therefore, the only change is that the elements of `store[i]` are printed.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `rows * cols - 1`
- `count` is `k - 1`
- `k` must be at least 2

The output of `print(*store[i])` is the elements of the list `store[i]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 1`, `count` is `k - 1`, and `k` must be at least 2; the elements of `store[i]` are printed.**
