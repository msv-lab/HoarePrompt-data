Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows-1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols-1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - `rows`, `cols`, and `2 * k` are constraints that define the maximum size of the grid and the limit for `2 * k`.
   - `curr_x` and `curr_y` are both initially 0.
   - `turn` is initially set to some value, and `store` starts as either `[1, 1], [1, 2], ..., [1, cols]` if `turn` is now 1, or `[1, cols], [1, cols-1], ..., [1, 1]` if `turn` is now 0.
   
2. **Loop Code Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `cols-1`.
   - Inside the loop, `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to the `store` list for each iteration of `j`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - Since the loop runs for `cols` times, and `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop (which is not shown explicitly in the provided code snippet), the final value of `i` will be `rows-1`.
   - Therefore, `store` will contain all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows-1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols-1`.

4. **No Further Executions:**
   - The loop only appends new coordinates and does not change any other variables. Thus, if the loop does not execute at all (which is not possible based on the given constraints), the values of `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, and `store` would remain as initially defined.

Given this analysis, the final output state is that `store` will contain all possible coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows-1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols-1`.
