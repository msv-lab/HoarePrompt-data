Postcondition: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is either 0 or 1, and `store` contains either the list `[i + 1, 1], [i + 1, 2], \ldots, [i + 1, cols]` if `turn` is 0, or all the coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is 1.**
