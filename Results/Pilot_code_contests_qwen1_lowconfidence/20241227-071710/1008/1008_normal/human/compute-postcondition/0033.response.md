The code appends a new element to the `store` list, which is currently either a list of coordinates or a list of lists containing `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive). Since `j` is `cols - 1`, the appended element will be `[i + 1, j + 1] = [i + 1, cols]`. 

Let's consider the previous values:
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value
- `store` contains either `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 0
- `j` is `cols - 1`

Since the new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` is added to `store`, and given `j` is `cols - 1`, the new element is `[i + 1, cols]`.

The output state will include the updated `store` and the unchanged `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, and `j`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` is `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 0 plus `[i + 1, cols]`, `j` is `cols - 1`**.
