The code appends a new coordinate `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `j` is `cols`, and `i` starts from 0 and increases as the loop progresses through the rows.

- Initially, `store` contains either the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]` for each `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to 0, plus the new coordinate `[i + 1, 2]`.
- After appending `[i + 1, j + 1]`, the new coordinate `[i + 1, j + 1]` is added to `store`.

Given `i` is 0 and `j` is `cols`, the new coordinate added is `[0 + 1, cols + 1]` which simplifies to `[1, cols + 1]`.

Therefore, the updated `store` will contain all the initial elements plus the new coordinate `[1, cols + 1]`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` contains the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]` for each `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to 0, plus the new coordinate `[i + 1, 2]` and the additional coordinate `[1, cols + 1]`, `j` is `cols`**.
