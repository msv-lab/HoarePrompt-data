Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is a list containing all the coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)`, meaning it starts from `cols - 1` and decrements down to 0.
- For each iteration, it appends the coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to the list `store`.
- Since the loop runs from `cols - 1` down to 0, it will append all possible coordinates for a given row `i` to the list `store`.
- After the loop completes, `store` will contain all the coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(j\) in the specified range.
- The variables `rows`, `cols`, `2 * k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `turn` do not change within the loop, so they retain their original values.

Therefore, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is as described above.
