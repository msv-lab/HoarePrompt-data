The `turn` variable is being toggled using the XOR operator (`^=`). This means if `turn` was originally `True`, it will become `False`, and if it was `False`, it will become `True`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is its original value
- `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, plus either \([rows, cols]\) if `turn` is false or \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to `0` (inclusive) if `turn` is true.

After executing `turn ^= 1`, the `turn` value is flipped. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is flipped from its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, plus either \([rows, cols]\) if `turn` is false or \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to `0` (inclusive) if `turn` is true.**
