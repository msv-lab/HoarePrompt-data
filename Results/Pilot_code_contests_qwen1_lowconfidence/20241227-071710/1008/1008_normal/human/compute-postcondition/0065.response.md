The code prints the elements of `store[i + 1]` using the `print(*store[i + 1])` statement. Given the initial state, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`. Therefore, `store[1]` (since `i` is 1) would contain \([2, 1], [3, 1], \ldots, [rows, 1]\).

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Thus, the output state will be:

- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\),
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\),
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\),
- `curr_x` is 0,
- `curr_y` is 0,
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value,
- `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`,
- `i` is 1,
- `count` is 0,
- `k` must be at least 2,
- The value `1 1` is printed without a newline.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, `i` is 1, `count` is 0, `k` must be at least 2, 1 1 is printed without a newline.**
