The initial state involves `print(2, end=' ')` having been executed, which means it has printed `2` followed by a space. The code snippet `print(*store[i + 1])` impacts the following:

1. It accesses `store[i + 1]`.
2. It unpacks and prints each element of `store[i + 1]` separated by spaces.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `store` or `i`, we can only describe the changes made by the code without specific numerical values. 

Output State: **`print(2, end=' ')` has been executed, followed by printing elements from `store[i + 1]` separated by spaces.**
