Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `rows` and `cols` are initialized as positive integers within the specified ranges.
   - `2 * k` is also initialized as a positive integer within the specified range.
   - `curr_x` and `curr_y` start at 0.
   - `turn` starts at an unknown value (either 0 or 1).
   - `store` starts as an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs `rows` times.
   - Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop that runs `cols` times if `turn` is 0, or `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is 1.
   - Each iteration of the inner loop appends a coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to `store`.

3. **Turn Flipping**:
   - After each complete pass through the outer loop (`rows` times), the `turn` variable flips between 0 and 1.
   - This means that after `rows` iterations, `turn` will be the opposite of its original value.

4. **Final State**:
   - Since the loop runs `rows` times, it covers all possible coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`.
   - `curr_x` and `curr_y` remain 0 as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `turn` is the opposite of its original value.
   - `store` contains all the coordinates generated by the loop, which are \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) and \(j\) as described.

This ensures that after all iterations of the loop, the variables have the specified final values and relationships.
