Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is either `rows * cols` and printed, or remains `rows * cols - 1`
   - `count` is `k - 1`
   - `k` must be at least 2

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs as long as `i < rows * cols`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `rows * cols`.
   - From the initial states, we know that `i` is either `rows * cols` (and then printed) or `rows * cols - 1`.

4. **Analyzing `i`**:
   - If `i` is `rows * cols`, it means the loop has already terminated and `i` was set to `rows * cols` and possibly printed.
   - If `i` is `rows * cols - 1`, then the loop can still execute one more time because `i < rows * cols` would still hold true.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is `rows * cols` in the previous iteration, it indicates that the loop has already completed its execution.
   - Therefore, to make the loop execute again, `i` must start from `rows * cols - 1`.

6. **Other States**:
   - The values of `count` and `k` do not directly affect the condition `i < rows * cols`. They might be part of the loop body, but their values do not influence the loop continuation condition based on the given information.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to `rows * cols - 1`.

Thus, the modified state should be:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 1`, `count` is `k - 1`, and `k` must be at least 2**
