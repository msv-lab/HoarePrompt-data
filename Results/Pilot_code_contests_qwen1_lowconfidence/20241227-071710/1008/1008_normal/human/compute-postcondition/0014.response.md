To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial conditions step by step.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop iterates over the values of `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), with a step of `-1`.

Given initial states:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2 * k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is 1
- `store` is []

The loop condition depends on the value of `cols`, as the loop iterates from `cols - 1` down to `0`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `cols`**: The loop will start if `cols` is at least 1. However, since `cols` is specified to be a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, we know `cols` is always valid for the loop to start.

2. **Range of `j`**: The loop will run as long as `j` remains within the range defined by `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)`. Since the loop runs from `cols - 1` down to `0`, it will definitely execute because `cols` is a positive integer.

### Conclusion:

- The loop will always execute because `cols` is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range, and the range `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)` is well-defined for `cols` starting from `cols - 1` down to `0`.

Thus, no additional adjustments are necessary to the initial states for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:

State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `2 * k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2 * k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is []**

(Note: The initial value of `total` being 0 is mentioned here as an example, but it was not part of the original states given. If you need to adjust `total` for the loop to execute, you would need additional context or conditions.)
