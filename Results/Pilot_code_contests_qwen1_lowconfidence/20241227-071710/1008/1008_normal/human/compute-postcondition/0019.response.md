The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. Given the initial conditions:

- `total` is 0
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is 1
- `store` is \([-1, 0], [i + 1, j + 1]\)
- `j` must be `cols - 2` or higher

Since `store` was initially \([-1, 0], [i + 1, j + 1]\) and now we append `[i + 1, j + 1]` to it, the new `store` will be \([-1, 0], [i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, j + 1]\).

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is \([-1, 0], [i + 1, j + 1], [i + 1, j + 1]\), `j` must be `cols - 2` or higher**
