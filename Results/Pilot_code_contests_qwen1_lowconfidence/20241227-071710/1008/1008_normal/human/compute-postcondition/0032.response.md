According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cols` and the loop variable `j`. The loop will iterate over the range from `cols - 1` to 0, so `cols` must be at least 1. However, given the constraints, `cols` is already guaranteed to be a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\).

The loop variable `j` starts at `cols - 1` and decrements until it reaches 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to `cols - 1`.

Given the initial states:
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value
- `store` contains either the list `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 0.

We need to ensure that `j` is set to `cols - 1` for the loop to start correctly.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` contains either the list `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 0, `j` is `cols - 1`**.
