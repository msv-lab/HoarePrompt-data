Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop step by step:

### Given Program State:
- `count` is equal to the original value of `count` plus 1.
- `print(2, end=' ')` has been executed.
- `i` is increased by 2.

### Loop Condition:
```
while count < k - 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `count < k - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `count` must be less than `k - 1`.

Given the current state:
- `count` is equal to the original value of `count` plus 1.
- Therefore, `count` is now `original_count + 1`.

To satisfy the loop condition `count < k - 1` for the next iteration:
- `count` must be less than `k - 1`.
- Since `count` is already `original_count + 1`, we need `original_count + 1` to be less than `k - 1`.

Thus, `original_count` must be such that when increased by 1, it is still less than `k - 1`. This means `original_count` must be less than `k - 2`.

### Adjusted States:
- `count` is equal to the original value of `count` plus 1.
- `i` is increased by 2.
- To allow the loop to execute one more time, `original_count` must be less than `k - 2`.

Therefore, the modified program state should reflect these adjustments.

### Final Answer:
State: **`count` is equal to the original value of `count` plus 1, `i` is increased by 2, and `original_count` must be less than `k - 2`**
