The code `i += 2` increments the value of `i` by 2. Initially, `print(2, end=' ')` has been executed, which prints `2` followed by a space. After that, elements from `store[i + 1]` are printed separated by spaces. The value of `i` was used in the print statement for indexing into `store`. Now, `i` is incremented by 2, so the next elements from `store[i + 1]` will be accessed.

Output State: **`print(2, end=' ')` has been executed, followed by printing elements from `store[i + 1]` separated by spaces; i is increased by 2.**
