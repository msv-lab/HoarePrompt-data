`store` originally contains `[i + 1, j]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`. The code appends `[i + 1, j + 1]` to `store`. Since `[i + 1, j + 1]` is already in `store`, appending it again does not change its contents. The value of `j` remains `cols - 2`, and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is `cols - 2`, `store` contains `[i + 1, j]`, `[i + 1, j + 1]`, and `[i + 1, j + 1]` (the last element is repeated).

Output State: **`j` is `cols - 2`, `store` contains `[i + 1, cols - 2]`, `[i + 1, cols - 1]`, and `[i + 1, cols - 1]`**
