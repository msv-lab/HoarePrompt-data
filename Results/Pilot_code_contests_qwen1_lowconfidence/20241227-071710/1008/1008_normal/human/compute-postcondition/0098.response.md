The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is `rows * cols - 1`. After incrementing, the new value of `i` is `rows * cols`. The states of the other variables (`total`, `count`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols`, `count` is `k - 1`, and `k` must be at least 2.**
