`store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state, but `j` is between `cols - 1` and `0` (inclusive). After executing the code, the `store` list will contain the new element `[i + 1, j + 1]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is between `cols - 1` and `0` (inclusive); `store` contains `[i + 1, j + 1]`; `i` is unchanged**
