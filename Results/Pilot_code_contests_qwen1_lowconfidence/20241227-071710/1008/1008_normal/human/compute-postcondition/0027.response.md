The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial conditions, `j` is 1, so the new element added to `store` is `[i + 1, 2]`. The values of `rows`, `cols`, `2 * k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `turn` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and `store` contains either the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive), plus the new coordinate \([i + 1, 2]`).**
