According to the code, the loop will iterate over the variable `j` ranging from 0 to `cols - 1`. For the loop to execute, the variable `cols` must be at least 1. However, since `cols` is already defined as a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), this condition is already satisfied.

The key points to consider are:
- The loop will increment `j` starting from 0 up to `cols - 1`.
- Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust the states within the loop itself.

Given the initial states:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- \(2 * k\) is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is 0
- `store` is an empty list
- `turn` is still 0

The only state that needs to be explicitly mentioned for the loop to execute is that `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1 (which is already ensured by the given constraints).

State: **`total` is not applicable here, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), \(2 * k\) is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` is an empty list, and `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1**
