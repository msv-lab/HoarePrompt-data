To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop condition and how they are initialized or should be initialized before the loop starts.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(cols):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Variable `j`**: The loop iterates over the range of `cols`. Therefore, `j` needs to be initialized to 0 and should increase until it reaches `cols`.

2. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is given as `rows - 1`. This is the starting value of `i` but is not directly involved in the loop condition. However, it should remain consistent with the provided state.

3. **Other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `2 * k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `store`)**: These variables are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect the loop execution. They remain unchanged within the loop.

Based on this analysis, the key adjustment needed is to set `j` to 0, as it is the variable being incremented within the loop condition and should start from 0 to reach up to `cols - 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` is 0 (to ensure the loop can start and iterate correctly)

Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, and `i` is `rows - 1**
