The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, `i` and `j` are not specified, but `j` is known to be `cols - 1`. After appending, the `store` list will contain two lists: `[i + 1, j + 1]` and `[i + 1, cols]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable here, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), \(2 * k\) is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` contains the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` and `[i + 1, cols]`, and `j` is equal to `cols - 1`.**
