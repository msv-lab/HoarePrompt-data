According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value
- `store` includes `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 2` if `turn` is now 0 plus `[i + 1, cols]`, a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` has been appended to `store`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 from its current value and still be within the range of `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was decremented by 1, meaning it was just before its current value. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `j` must now be equal to `cols - 2`.

Given that `j` is now `cols - 2`, let's summarize the states needed for the next iteration:

- `rows` remains the same: \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` remains the same: \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` remains the same: \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` remains the same: 0
- `curr_y` remains the same: 0
- `turn` remains the same: the opposite of its original value
- `store` includes `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 2` if `turn` is now 0 plus `[i + 1, cols]`, a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` has been appended to `store`.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` includes `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 2` if `turn` is now 0 plus `[i + 1, cols]`, a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` has been appended to `store`, `j` is `cols - 2`**
