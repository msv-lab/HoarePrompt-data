The value of `i` is increased by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected, except for the fact that now the elements of `store` starting from index `i + 1` can be printed since `i` has been updated. The precondition that `original_count` is less than `k - 2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is equal to its original value plus 1; `i` is increased by 2; the elements of `store` starting from index `i + 1` are printed; `original_count` is less than `k - 2`.**
