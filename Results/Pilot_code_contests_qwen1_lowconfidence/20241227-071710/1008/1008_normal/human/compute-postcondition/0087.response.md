Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is either `rows * cols - 1` or `rows * cols - 2`, `count` is `k - 1`, `k` must be at least 2, and the printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`. If `i` equals `rows * cols - 1`, the elements of `store[i]` are printed. Otherwise, `i` remains `rows * cols - 2`.***
