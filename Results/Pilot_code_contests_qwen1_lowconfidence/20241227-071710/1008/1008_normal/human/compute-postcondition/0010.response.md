Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
   - `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\).
   - \(2 * k\) is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\).
   - `curr_x` is 0.
   - `curr_y` is 0.
   - `turn` is 0.
   - `store` contains the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` and `[i + 1, cols]`.
   - `j` is equal to `cols - 1`.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for j in range(cols):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and iterates up to `cols - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `cols - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `cols`.
   - Since `j` is currently `cols - 1`, it cannot be incremented further without changing the value of `cols`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value of `j`.
   - `j` should be set to 0 (the start of the next iteration).

6. **Updated States**:
   - `rows` remains unchanged.
   - `cols` remains unchanged.
   - `curr_x` remains 0.
   - `curr_y` remains 0.
   - `turn` remains 0.
   - `store` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is now 0.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` contains the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` and `[i + 1, cols]`, and `j` is 0**.
