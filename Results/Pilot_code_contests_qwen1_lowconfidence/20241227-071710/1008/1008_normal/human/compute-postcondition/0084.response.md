The code snippet `print(*store[i])` prints the elements of the list `store[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `rows * cols - 1`, which means `store[i]` refers to the last element in the list `store`. Since no further assignment or modification to `i` is made, `i` remains unchanged. The printed value is specified as `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`, which is already calculated and known.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 1`, `count` is `k - 1`, the printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`, and the elements of `store[i]` are printed.**
