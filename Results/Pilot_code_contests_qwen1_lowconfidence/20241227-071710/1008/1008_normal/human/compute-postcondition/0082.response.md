Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given States:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value
- `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`
- `i` is `rows * cols - 2`
- `count` is `k - 1`
- `k` must be at least 2
- The printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `i < rows * cols`.

### Analysis:
- Right before the loop, `i` is set to `rows * cols - 2`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `rows * cols`.

To make the loop execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `rows * cols`. Since `i` is currently `rows * cols - 2`, the next value of `i` after the first iteration of the loop will be `rows * cols - 1`. 

Thus, we only need to ensure that the loop condition is satisfied, which means `i` should be less than `rows * cols` after the first iteration. This is already the case because `i` is `rows * cols - 2`.

### Conclusion:
No other state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 2`, `count` is `k - 1`, `k` must be at least 2, and the printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`**
