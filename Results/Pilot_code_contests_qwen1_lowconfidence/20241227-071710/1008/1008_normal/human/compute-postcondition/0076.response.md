The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` does not directly assign any new values to variables. It prints the elements in the list `store` starting from index `i` with a space as the separator, but this operation does not affect the values of `count`, `i`, `original_count`, or `store`. The number 2 has already been printed before this line of code.

Output State: **`count` is equal to the original value of `count` plus 1, `i` is increased by 2, and `original_count` must be less than `k - 2`. The number 2 has been printed followed by a space.**
