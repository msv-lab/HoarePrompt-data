Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given Information:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `rows * cols - 1`
- `count` is `k - 1`
- `k` must be at least 2
- The printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i < rows * cols:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State of Variables:**
   - `i` is `rows * cols - 1`
   - This means that `i` is already at the maximum value possible within the range `0` to `rows * cols - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < rows * cols`.
   - Since `i` is currently `rows * cols - 1`, the condition `i < rows * cols` evaluates to `False`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `i` becomes less than `rows * cols` at the start of the next iteration.
   - This can be achieved by decrementing `i` by 1, making it `rows * cols - 2`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `count` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute, we do not need to change this value directly, but we should ensure that `k` remains valid (at least 2).
   - `total` is 0 and is not directly affected by the loop condition.

5. **Printed Value:**
   - The printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should remain at least 2, so this value will be consistent.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be `rows * cols - 2` to allow the loop to execute one more time.
- Other states do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 2`, `count` is `k - 1`, `k` must be at least 2**
