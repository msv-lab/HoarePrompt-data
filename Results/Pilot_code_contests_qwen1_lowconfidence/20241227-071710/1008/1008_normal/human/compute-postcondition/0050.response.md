To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables and conditions involved in the for loop:

1. The loop iterates over the variable `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to `0`.
2. The loop's condition is based on the range function, which uses the starting value (`cols - 1`), the ending value (`-1`), and the step value (`-1`).

Given the initial state:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\).
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\).
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `turn` is not its original value.
- `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`.
- `i` is `rows - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range specified by the `range` function, i.e., `cols - 1` to `0`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `j` being within the range of `cols - 1` to `0`.

State: **`j` is between `cols - 1` and `0` (inclusive)**

Since `j` is initialized to `cols - 1` and will decrement by 1 until it reaches 0, the loop will always execute as long as `cols` is a valid positive integer. No further adjustments are needed for the other variables in this context.
