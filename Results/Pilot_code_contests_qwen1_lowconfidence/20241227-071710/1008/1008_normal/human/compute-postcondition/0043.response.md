The code appends the current coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to the list `store`. Given the initial state, `i` is `rows - 1`, so the coordinates being appended are \([rows, cols]\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state includes the new entry in the `store` list and the unchanged values of other variables.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1` plus \([rows, cols]\), and `i` is `rows - 1**
