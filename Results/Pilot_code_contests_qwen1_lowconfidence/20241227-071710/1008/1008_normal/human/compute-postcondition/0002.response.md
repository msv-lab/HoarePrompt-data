`turn` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `rows`, `cols`, and `k` remain unchanged because they are the return values of `func_1()`, and `curr_x` and `curr_y` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `rows` and `cols` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `rows`, `cols` ≤ 300; `2 * k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2 * `k` ≤ `rows * cols`; `rows`, `cols`, and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`; `curr_x` is 0; `curr_y` is 0; `turn` is 0.

Output State: **`rows` and `cols` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `rows`, `cols` ≤ 300; `2 * k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2 * `k` ≤ `rows * cols`; `rows`, `cols`, and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`; `curr_x` is 0; `curr_y` is 0; `turn` is 0.**
