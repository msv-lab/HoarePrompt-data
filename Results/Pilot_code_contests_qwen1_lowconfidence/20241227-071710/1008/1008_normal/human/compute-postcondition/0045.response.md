The code appends the current coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to the list `store`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `rows - 1`, so the coordinates being appended will be \([rows, cols + 1]\). However, since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `cols - 1`, the correct coordinates will be \([rows, cols]\).

The other variables remain unchanged: `total` is 0, `j` is 1, `rows` and `cols` retain their original values, `2 * k` retains its original value, `curr_x` and `curr_y` retain their original values, `turn` retains its original value, and `store` now includes the new coordinate.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 1, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1` plus \([rows, cols]\), and the new coordinate \([rows, cols]\) is also included.**
