`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `count` was 0 before the increment, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, `i` is 3, `count` is 1, `k` must be at least 2, 1 1 is printed without a newline.**
