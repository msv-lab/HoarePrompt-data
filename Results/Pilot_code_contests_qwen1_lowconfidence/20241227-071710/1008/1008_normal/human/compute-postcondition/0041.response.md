Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
   - `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\).
   - `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\).
   - `curr_x` is 0.
   - `curr_y` is 0.
   - `turn` is its original value.
   - `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(rows):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will iterate over each row from 0 to `rows - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration) must be less than `rows`.

4. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `i` ranges from 0 to `rows - 1`, if the loop just completed an iteration, then `i` was equal to `rows - 2` (assuming zero-based indexing).

5. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will now be incremented by 1, so it will be `rows - 1`.
   - All other variables (`curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `store`) remain unchanged as there is no mention of these variables being modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the updated state for the next iteration should reflect `i` being incremented by 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, and `i` is `rows - 1`**.
