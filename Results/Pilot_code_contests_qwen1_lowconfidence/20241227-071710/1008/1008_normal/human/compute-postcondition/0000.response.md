The code `rows, cols, k = func_1()` assigns the return values of the function `func_1()` to the variables `rows`, `cols`, and `k`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of these variables. However, we know from the precondition that `rows` and `cols` are positive integers between 2 and 300, and `2 * k` is a positive integer between 2 and the product of `rows` and `cols`.

Given this, the output state will reflect that the variables `rows`, `cols`, and `k` have been updated to the return values of `func_1()`, while the conditions on their values remain intact.

Output State: **`rows` and `cols` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ `rows`, `cols` ≤ 300; `2 * k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2 * `k` ≤ `rows * cols`; `rows`, `cols`, and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`**
