The code appends `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. Given the initial state, `j` is between `cols - 1` and `0` (inclusive), `store` contains `[i + 1, j]`, and `i` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `store` will contain both `[i + 1, j]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

Output State: **`j` is between `cols - 1` and `0` (inclusive); `store` contains `[i + 1, j]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`; `i` is unchanged**
