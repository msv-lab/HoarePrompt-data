According to the code, the loop will iterate based on the value of `rows`. The loop can execute as long as `rows` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. The initial values of `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, and `store` provided do not affect the ability of the loop to execute since they are not used to control the loop's condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `rows` is a positive integer within the specified range (2 ≤ rows ≤ 300).

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300, `2 * k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2 * k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` is []**
