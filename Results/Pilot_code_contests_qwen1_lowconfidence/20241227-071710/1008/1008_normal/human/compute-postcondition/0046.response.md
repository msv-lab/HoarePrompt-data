According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `cols`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given:

- `total` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is its original value
- `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1` plus \([rows, cols]\)

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `cols`. Since `j` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2. This means the loop will check if `j` (now 2) is still less than `cols`.

The other states remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are mentioned.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 2, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1` plus \([rows, cols]\)**
