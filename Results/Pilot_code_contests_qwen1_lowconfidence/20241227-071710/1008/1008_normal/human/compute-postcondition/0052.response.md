According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `cols - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is between `cols - 1` and `0` (inclusive), `store` contains `[i + 1, j + 1]`, and `i` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must decrease by 1 from its current value. Since `j` is currently between `cols - 1` and `0` (inclusive), the next value of `j` will be `j - 1`.

Let's summarize the changes:

- The current value of `j` is within the range `cols - 1` to `0` (inclusive).
- After the next iteration, `j` will be `j - 1`, which means it will still be within the same range because `j` was already at its lowest value in the previous iteration.

Since `i` remains unchanged and `j` decreases by 1, the new value of `j` will still be within the valid range, and `store` will contain the updated values `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

State: **`j` is between `cols - 1` and `0` (inclusive); `store` contains `[i + 1, j]`; `i` is unchanged**
