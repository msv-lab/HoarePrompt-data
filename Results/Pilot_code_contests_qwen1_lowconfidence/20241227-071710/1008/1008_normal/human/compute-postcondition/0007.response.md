The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not provided in the initial state, so they remain unknown. The only change is that the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` is added to `store`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable here, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), \(2 * k\) is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` contains the list `[i + 1, j + 1]`, and `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
