The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Since the initial values of `i` and `j` are not specified, they remain as they are in the context of this operation. However, we know that `i` and `j` are supposed to be indices that get incremented by 1 before being appended.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is 1
- `store` is \([-1, 0]\)

After executing the code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])`, the value of `store` will be updated to include the new list. Therefore, the updated `store` will be \([-1, 0], [i + 1, j + 1]\).

Output State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is \([-1, 0], [i + 1, j + 1]\)**
