Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total` is 0
- `j` is 0
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is its original value
- `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1` plus \([rows, cols]\)
- `i` is `rows - 1`

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(cols):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The for loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `cols - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1.

### Updated States:
- `j` will be incremented to 1.
- All other states remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `j` is 1, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1` plus \([rows, cols]\), and `i` is `rows - 1**
