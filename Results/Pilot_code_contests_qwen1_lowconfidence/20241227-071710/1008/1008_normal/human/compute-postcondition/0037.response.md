Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as:
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
   - `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
   - `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
   - `curr_x` is 0
   - `curr_y` is 0
   - `turn` is the opposite of its original value
   - `store` includes `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 2` if `turn` is now 0 plus `[i + 1, cols]`, a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` has been appended to `store`, `j` is `cols - 2`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   store.append([i + 1, j + 1])
   ```

   Here, `i` and `j` are not defined in the provided snippet. However, based on the description, we know the context of `i` and `j`. For simplicity, let's assume the following:
   - If `turn` is 1, `store` includes `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive).
   - If `turn` is 0, `store` includes `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 2` to 0 (inclusive) plus `[i + 1, cols]`.

3. Given the nature of the code, we can infer that `i` and `j` would be within these ranges when the code runs.

4. After executing the line `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])`, a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` is added to `store`.

5. Since the code does not affect any other variables, their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value
- `store` includes `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 2` if `turn` is now 0 plus `[i + 1, cols]`, a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` has been appended to `store`, `j` is `cols - 2` plus the newly added element `[i + 1, j + 1]`

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\); `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\); `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\); `curr_x` is 0; `curr_y` is 0; `turn` is the opposite of its original value; `store` includes `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 2` if `turn` is now 0 plus `[i + 1, cols]`, a new element `[i + 1, j + 1]` has been appended to `store`, `j` is `cols - 2` plus the newly added element `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
