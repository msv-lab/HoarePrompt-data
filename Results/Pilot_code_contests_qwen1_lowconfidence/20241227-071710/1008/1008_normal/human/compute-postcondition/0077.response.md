The code `print(*store[i + 1])` will print the elements of the list `store` starting from index `i + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `store` or `i`. The only variables affected by the code are `store` and `i`.

- `count` is incremented by 1, so `count` is now equal to its original value plus 1.
- `i` is increased by 2, so `i` is now `i + 2`.
- `original_count` is less than `k - 2`, which remains unchanged.

The code prints the elements of `store` starting from index `i + 1`, but since the exact values of `store` and `i` are not given, we cannot specify the exact output. However, we can say that the code has executed and updated the values of `count` and `i`.

Output State: **`count` is equal to its original value plus 1; `i` is increased by 2; the elements of `store` starting from index `i + 1` are printed; `original_count` is less than `k - 2`.**
