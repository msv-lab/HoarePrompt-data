`i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is either `rows * cols - 1` or `rows * cols - 2`. After incrementing, `i` will be `rows * cols - 1` or `rows * cols - 1` respectively. The value of `count` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The printed value also remains the same as it is based on the value of `k`, which is unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 1`, `count` is `k - 1`, `k` must be at least 2, and the printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`.**
