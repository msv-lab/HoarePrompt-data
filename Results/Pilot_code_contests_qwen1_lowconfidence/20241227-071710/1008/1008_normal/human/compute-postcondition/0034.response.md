Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value
- `store` is `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 1` if `turn` is now 0 plus `[i + 1, cols]`

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive). This means it starts from `cols - 1` and decrements `j` until it reaches 0.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is `cols - 1`

### Next Iteration:
Since the loop starts from `cols - 1` and decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `cols - 2`.

### Updated States:
- `j` becomes `cols - 2`

### Other States Remain Unchanged:
- `rows` remains the same
- `cols` remains the same
- `2 * k` remains the same
- `curr_x` remains 0
- `curr_y` remains 0
- `turn` remains the opposite of its original value
- `store` remains the same as the previous state because it does not depend on the value of `j`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` is `[1, j + 1]` for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates `[1, j + 1]`, `j` is `cols - 2` if `turn` is now 0 plus `[i + 1, cols]`**
