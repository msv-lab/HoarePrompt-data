The code `turn ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `turn` and 1, which effectively toggles the value of `turn`. Given the initial state, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, but since the exact original value is not specified, we can infer that toggling it will revert it back to its original value.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- Initially, `turn` is the opposite of its original value.
- After executing `turn ^= 1`, `turn` is toggled to its original value.

Therefore, the output state is: `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, and `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, and `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`.**
