Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value
- `store` contains either:
  - The list `[i + 1, 1], [i + 1, 2], \ldots, [i + 1, cols]` if `turn` is now 1
  - All the coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 0

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(rows):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over `i` from 0 to `rows - 1`.
2. **Initial Values**: At the start of the loop, `i` is 0.
3. **Increment**: `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

### Current State:
- `i` is 0 (since it's the first iteration).

### Next State:
- After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < rows`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be 1.
- `rows` remains unchanged.
- `cols` remains unchanged.
- `2 * k` remains unchanged.
- `curr_x` remains 0.
- `curr_y` remains 0.
- `turn` remains the opposite of its original value.
- `store` remains as previously described based on the value of `turn`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i` to be 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and `store` contains either the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` if `turn` is now 1, or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive) if `turn` is now 0.**
