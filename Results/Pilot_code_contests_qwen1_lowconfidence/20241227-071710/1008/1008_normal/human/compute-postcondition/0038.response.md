Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` contains all the coordinates `[i + 1, j + 1]` for each \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and each \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `cols - 1` to 0. This means that for every row `i`, all columns `j` are appended to `store`.
- After the loop completes, `store` will contain every coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for all rows `i` from 0 to `rows - 1` and all columns `j` from 0 to `cols - 1`.
- The values of `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `rows`, `cols`, and `2 * k` do not change during the loop, so they retain their original values.
- The value of `turn` is updated to be the opposite of its original value, but this does not affect the contents of `store`.

Thus, after the loop executes, `store` will contain all possible coordinates within the grid defined by `rows` and `cols`.
