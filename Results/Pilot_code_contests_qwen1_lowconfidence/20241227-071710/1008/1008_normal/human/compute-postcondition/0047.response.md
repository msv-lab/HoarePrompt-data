The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, plus \([rows, cols]\). Since the code appends another coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to `store`, this new coordinate is added to the existing contents of `store`.

- `total` remains 0.
- `j` remains 2.
- `rows` remains a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
- `cols` remains a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\).
- `2 * k` remains a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\).
- `curr_x` remains 0.
- `curr_y` remains 0.
- `turn` remains its original value.
- `store` now contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, plus \([rows, cols]\) and the new coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\).

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`total` is 0, `j` is 2, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, plus \([rows, cols]\) and \([i + 1, j + 1]`**.
