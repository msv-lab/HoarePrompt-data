The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The previous state was that `count` is equal to its original value plus 1, so after this line, `count` will be equal to its original value plus 2. The states of the other variables (`i`, `store`, and `original_count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is equal to its original value plus 2; `i` is increased by 2; the elements of `store` starting from index `i + 1` are printed; `original_count` is less than `k - 2`.**
