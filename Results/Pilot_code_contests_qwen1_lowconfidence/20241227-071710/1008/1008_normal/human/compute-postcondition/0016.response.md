According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `cols - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `j` starts from `cols - 1` and decreases until it reaches `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `total` is 0
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is 1
- `store` is `[i + 1, j + 1]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. Since the loop decrements `j` starting from `cols - 1`, we need to determine the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration.

Let's denote the current value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `j_prev`. The next value of `j` (let's call it `j_next`) would be `j_prev - 1`.

Given that `j_prev` is the starting value of the previous iteration and the loop runs until `j` becomes `-1`, the next value of `j` should be `-1`.

So, `j` will be `-1` at the start of the next iteration. All other states remain unchanged because the loop body does not modify `rows`, `cols`, `2 * k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, and `store` based on the information given.

State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is \([-1, j + 1]\)**

However, since `j` starts from `cols - 1` and decreases by 1 each time, `j` will reach `-1` when the loop completes its iterations. Therefore, the final state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is \([-1, 0]\)**
