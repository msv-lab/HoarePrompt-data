The code appends a new coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to the `store` list. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact coordinates that will be appended. We know that `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and `store` contains either the list of the first column or the last column depending on the original value of `turn`. After appending \([i + 1, j + 1]\), the structure of `store` will include this new coordinate.

Therefore, the output state is: `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and `store` contains either the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive), plus the new coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\).

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and `store` contains either the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive), plus the new coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\).**
