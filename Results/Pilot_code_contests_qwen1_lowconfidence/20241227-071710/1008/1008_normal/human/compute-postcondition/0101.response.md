Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and performs the following actions: It first initializes a list `store` containing all coordinates in a grid of size `rows` by `cols`. It then prints a sequence of coordinates from `store` in a specific pattern. Specifically, it prints the first two coordinates from `store` repeatedly until `k-1` times have been printed, followed by the remaining coordinates in `store` in a linear sequence. The function ensures that the total number of printed coordinates is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`. This process involves iterating over the grid in a zigzag manner and printing pairs of coordinates alternately in forward and backward directions. The function covers the case where `k` is at least 2 and handles the grid dimensions within the specified limits (2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2 * k ≤ rows * cols).**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `k` is equal to 1, the function should print only one pair of coordinates, which is covered implicitly by the condition `count < k - 1` in the loop.
- If `rows * cols` is less than `2 * (k - 1)`, the function would attempt to print more coordinates than available, which is not possible due to the check in the loops. The function inherently handles this scenario by ensuring the loop conditions are valid.

**Missing functionality:**
- The code does not update `curr_x` and `curr_y` during the process, so these variables remain at their initial values (0, 0) throughout the function. This might be a missing or unnecessary action based on the problem's requirements.
