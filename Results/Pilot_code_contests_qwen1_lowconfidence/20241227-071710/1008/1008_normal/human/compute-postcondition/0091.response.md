The code snippet `print(*store[i], end=' ')` prints the elements of `store[i]` separated by a space without a newline at the end. However, this code does not assign any new values to the variables `total`, `i`, `count`, or `k`. It only prints the elements of `store[i]`. 

Given the initial state: `total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 2`, `count` is `k - 1`, `k` must be at least 2.

After running the code, the values of `total`, `i`, `count`, and `k` remain unchanged. The output of the print statement will be the elements of `store[i]` printed with a space separator, but since no new values are assigned, the variables themselves do not change.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 2`, `count` is `k - 1`, `k` must be at least 2**
