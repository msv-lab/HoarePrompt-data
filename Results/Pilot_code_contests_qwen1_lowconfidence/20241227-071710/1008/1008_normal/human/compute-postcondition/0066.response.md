`i` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, `i` is 3, `count` is 0, `k` must be at least 2, 1 1 is printed without a newline.
