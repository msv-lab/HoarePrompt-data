The code `print(2, end=' ')` does not change any variable values; it only prints the number 2 followed by a space. Therefore, the values of the variables `count`, `i`, `original_count`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is equal to the original value of `count` plus 1, `i` is increased by 2, and `original_count` must be less than `k - 2`. The number 2 has been printed followed by a space.**
