Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
   - `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
   - `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
   - `curr_x` is 0
   - `curr_y` is 0
   - `turn` is 1
   - `store` is \([-1, 0], [i + 1, j + 1]\)

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `cols - 1` down to `0`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was decremented by 1.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range specified by `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)`.
   - Since `j` was decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be `cols - 2`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be `cols - 2` or higher for the loop to continue executing.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `rows`, `cols`, and `2 * k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
   - `curr_x` and `curr_y` remain 0 as they are not affected by the loop.
   - `turn` remains 1 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `store` remains \([-1, 0], [i + 1, j + 1]\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `cols - 2` or higher, and all other states remain the same.

Therefore, the updated states are:

State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is \([-1, 0], [i + 1, j + 1]\), `j` must be `cols - 2` or higher**
