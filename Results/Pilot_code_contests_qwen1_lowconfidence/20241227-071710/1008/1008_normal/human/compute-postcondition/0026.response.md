According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over the variable `j` which ranges from `0` to `cols-1`. The loop will execute again if `j < cols`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value
- `store` contains either the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive), plus the new coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\)

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `cols`. Since the loop starts with `j = 0` and increments `j` at each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `curr_x` remains 0
- `curr_y` remains 0
- `turn` remains the opposite of its original value
- `store` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration

The only change needed is for `j` to become 1.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and `store` contains either the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive), plus the new coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\). `j` is 1**
