The initial state includes that `print(2, end=' ')` has been executed. This means that the number 2 followed by a space has been printed. The code snippet `print(*store[i], end=' ')` implies that `store` is a list and `i` is an index into that list. However, since `store` and `i` are not defined in the given context, we cannot determine their specific values. The only thing we know for certain is that this line of code will print elements from the list `store` at index `i`, followed by a space.

Since we don't have specific values for `store` and `i`, we can only state that the code will print elements from `store[i]`, followed by a space.

Output State: **`print(2, end=' ')` has been executed, the code will print elements from `store[i]`, followed by a space.**
