The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not provided in the initial state, and there are no statements assigning values to `i` and `j` before this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i` and `j` remain undefined, and the output state includes the fact that the list `store` now contains one additional element which is `[i + 1, j + 1]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `2 * k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2 * k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is `[i + 1, j + 1]`**
