Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided code and the initial conditions.

### Initial Conditions:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\).
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\).
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value.
- `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`.
- `i` is `rows * cols - 2`.
- `count` is `k - 1`.
- `k` must be at least 2.
- The printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`.

### Loop Code:
```python
while i < rows * cols:
    if i == rows * cols - 1:
        print(*store[i])
    else:
        print(*store[i], end=' ')
    i += 1
```

### Analysis of Loop Execution:
- The loop starts with `i` set to `rows * cols - 2`.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `rows * cols`.

#### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `i` starts at `rows * cols - 2`.
   - If `i == rows * cols - 1` (which is false here), it prints `*store[i]`.
   - `i` increments to `rows * cols - 1`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `i` is now `rows * cols - 1`.
   - If `i == rows * cols - 1` (which is true here), it prints `*store[i]`.
   - `i` increments to `rows * cols`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - The loop continues until `i` reaches `rows * cols`.
   - For each iteration, `i` increments by 1 and the corresponding coordinate in `store` is printed.

### Final State:
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be `rows * cols`.
- All coordinates from `store` from index `rows * cols - 2` to `rows * cols - 1` will have been printed.
- The loop control variable `i` will be `rows * cols`.
- The variables `count`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `turn` do not change within the loop and retain their initial values.

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, the final state after the loop has executed is:

Output State: **`i` is `rows * cols`, `count` is `k - 1`, `k` must be at least 2, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, and the printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`**.
