The code `print(*store[i])` prints the elements of the list `store[i]`. However, the initial values of the variables are not provided for `store`, `i`, and `rows`, `cols`, and `k`. Since `i` is defined as `rows * cols - 2`, and no specific values are given for `rows`, `cols`, or `store`, the only changes occur in `i` which is printed. The other variables (`total`, `count`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 0
- `i` is `rows * cols - 2`
- `count` is `k - 1`
- `k` must be at least 2

After executing the code, `i` is printed. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is printed, `count` is `k - 1`, `k` must be at least 2**
