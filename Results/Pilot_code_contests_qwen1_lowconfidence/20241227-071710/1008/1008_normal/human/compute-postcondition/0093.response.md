`i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` can be `rows * cols - 1` (if it was printed) or `rows * cols - 2` (otherwise). The states of the other variables (`count`, `k`) are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is either `rows * cols` and printed, or remains `rows * cols - 1`, `count` is `k - 1`, and `k` must be at least 2**
