The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the definition `def func_6()`. The constraints provided are for variables `rows`, `cols`, and `k`, but these are not parameters of the function.

Given the constraints:
- `rows` and `cols` are positive integers such that \(2 \leq rows, cols \leq 300\).
- \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq rows * cols\), where `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tubes.

Since no parameters are listed in the function definition, we can infer that the function might be dealing with these variables internally or using default values, but they are not passed as arguments to the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters.**
