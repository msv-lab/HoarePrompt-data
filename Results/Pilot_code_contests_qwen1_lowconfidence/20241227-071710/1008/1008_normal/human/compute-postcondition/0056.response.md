Output State: **`j` is 0, `store` contains all coordinates `[i + 1, j + 1]` for every `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to `0` (inclusive), `i` is unchanged.**

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order, starting from `cols - 1` down to `0`.
   - For each iteration, the loop appends the coordinate `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the list `store`.

2. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - After the first iteration (`j = cols - 1`), `store` contains `[i + 1, cols]`.
   - After the second iteration (`j = cols - 2`), `store` contains `[i + 1, cols - 1]` and `[i + 1, cols]`.
   - This pattern continues until `j` reaches `0`. At this point, `store` will contain `[i + 1, 1]`, `[i + 1, 2]`, ..., `[i + 1, cols - 1]`, and `[i + 1, 0]`.

3. **Final State:**
   - Since the loop iterates from `cols - 1` down to `0`, `j` will eventually become `0`.
   - `store` will contain all coordinates `[i + 1, j + 1]` for every `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to `0` (inclusive).

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`. Since `cols` is a positive integer, the loop will always execute at least once and continue until `j` reaches `0`.

5. **Unchanged Variables:**
   - `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop because the loop only modifies `j`.

Given these observations, the final state of the loop after all iterations will be that `j` is `0`, `store` contains all required coordinates, and `i` remains unchanged.
