According to the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `cols - 1` down to `-1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was between `cols - 1` and `0` (inclusive).
3. The value of `i` did not change.

To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

- If `j` was `cols - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then the next iteration would start with `j` as `cols - 2`.
- If `j` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, then the loop would have completed all iterations and would not execute again.

Since the problem asks for the state if the loop is to execute one more time, `j` must be `cols - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`j` is `cols - 2`, `store` contains `[i + 1, j]` and `[i + 1, j + 1]`, `i` is unchanged**
