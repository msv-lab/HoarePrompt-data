According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `cols`. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\).
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\).
- \(2 * k\) is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\).
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `turn` is 0.
- `store` contains the list `[i + 1, j + 1]`.
- `cols` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Since the loop is iterating over `j` from 0 to `cols - 1`, if `j` is less than `cols - 1`, the loop can execute again. Given that `j` starts from 0, at the end of the last iteration, `j` would be `cols - 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased to `cols`.

State: **`total` is not applicable here, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), \(2 * k\) is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` contains the list `[i + 1, j + 1]`, and `j` must be equal to `cols - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `cols`.**
