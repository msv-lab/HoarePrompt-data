The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` does not affect the variables `total`, `i`, `count`, `k`, or the value of `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`. It only prints the value at index `i` of the `store` list followed by a space, but it does not change any variable's value. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 2`, `count` is `k - 1`, `k` must be at least 2, and the printed value is `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`, `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`**
