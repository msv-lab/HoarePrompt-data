Postcondition: ***`curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1\), plus either \([rows, cols]\) if `turn` is false or \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every `j` in the range from `cols - 1` to `0` (inclusive) if `turn` is true.***
