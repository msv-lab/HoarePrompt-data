`count` is incremented by 1. The initial state involves `print(2, end=' ')` having been executed and `i` being increased by 2. No other variables are mentioned in the initial state. The code `count += 1` only affects the `count` variable.

Output State: **`count` is equal to the original value of `count` plus 1, `print(2, end=' ')` has been executed, and `i` is increased by 2.**
