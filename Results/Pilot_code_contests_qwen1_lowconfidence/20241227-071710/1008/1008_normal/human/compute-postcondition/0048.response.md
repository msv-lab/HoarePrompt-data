Output State: **`total` is 0, `j` is `cols - 1`, `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is its original value, `store` contains all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, plus \([rows, cols]\)**

### Explanation:

1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`.
   - For each iteration, the code appends the coordinate \([i + 1, j + 1]\) to the `store` list.
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 0` and goes up to `cols - 1`, it will execute exactly `cols` times.

2. **Variables After Loop Execution:**
   - `total`: This variable is not used in the loop, so it remains 0.
   - `j`: After the loop completes, `j` will be `cols - 1`.
   - `rows`, `cols`, `2 * k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `turn`: These variables are not modified by the loop, so they retain their original values.
   - `store`: The `store` list will contain all coordinates \([i + 1, j + 1]\) for every \(i\) in the range from 0 to `rows - 1` and every \(j\) in the range from 0 to `cols - 1`, plus the special coordinate \([rows, cols]\).

Since the loop will always execute `cols` times (as long as `cols` is a positive integer between 2 and 300), the final state of the program will match the above description.
