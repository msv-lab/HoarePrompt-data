Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\)
- `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\)
- `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\)
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is the opposite of its original value
- `store` contains either the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive), plus the new coordinate \([i + 1, 2]`).

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(cols):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `cols - 1`.
2. **Initial Values**: 
   - `j` starts at `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration.
   - `j` will reach `cols - 1` in the last iteration of the loop.

3. **Current Values at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` would be `cols - 1` if this is the last iteration.
   - After the last iteration, `j` would increment to `cols`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and increments to `cols - 1` in the last iteration, `j` will be `cols` in the next iteration.
   - Other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `2 * k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `store`) remain unchanged as the loop does not modify these values within the given constraints.

### Final Adjusted States:
- `j` is `cols`
- `rows` remains the same
- `cols` remains the same
- `2 * k` remains the same
- `curr_x` remains `0`
- `curr_y` remains `0`
- `turn` remains the opposite of its original value
- `store` remains the same

### Final Answer:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{rows} \leq 300\), `cols` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq \text{cols} \leq 300\), `2 * k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq 2 * k \leq \text{rows} * \text{cols}\), `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is the opposite of its original value, `store` contains either the list `[1, 1], [1, 2], \ldots, [1, cols]` or all the coordinates \([1, j + 1]\) for each \(j\) in the range from `cols - 1` to 0 (inclusive), plus the new coordinate \([i + 1, 2]\), `j` is `cols`**.
