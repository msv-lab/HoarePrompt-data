The code snippet `print(*store[i], end=' ')` does not directly modify any of the variables in the initial state. Instead, it prints the elements of the list `store[i]` separated by spaces and ends with a space. Since the code does not reassign any variables, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 1`, `count` is `k - 1`, and `k` must be at least 2**
