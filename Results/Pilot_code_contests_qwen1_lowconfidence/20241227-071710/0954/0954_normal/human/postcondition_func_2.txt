The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: an integer `a` representing the number of cards (1 <= a <= 1000), and two strings `b` and `c` of equal length `a` consisting of digits. It compares the digits of `b` and `c` character by character, counting the number of positions where the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `c` (`first`) and the number of positions where the digit in `b` is less than the digit in `c` (`second`). Based on the comparison results, it prints either 'RED', 'BLUE', or 'EQUAL' to the console. Specifically, if `first` is greater than `second`, it prints 'RED'. If `second` is greater than `first`, it prints 'BLUE'. If `first` equals `second`, it prints 'EQUAL'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console. Potential edge cases include when `a` is at its minimum (1) or maximum (1000), and the strings `b` and `c` can contain any valid single-digit numbers.
