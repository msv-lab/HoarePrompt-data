You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n cards numbered 1, …, n. The card i has a red digit r_i and a blue digit b_i written on it.

We arrange all n cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of 1, …, n having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer R. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer B. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how R and B can be found.

<image>

Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle R > B, and Blue bets that R < B. If in the end R = B, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.

Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Descriptions of T test cases follow. Each test case description starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of cards.

The following line contains a string of n digits r_1, …, r_n — red digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

The following line contains a string of n digits b_1, …, b_n — blue digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

Note that digits in the same line are not separated with any delimiters.

Output

Print T answers for the test cases in order, one per line.

If Red has a strictly higher change to win, print "RED".

If Blue has a strictly higher change to win, print "BLUE".

If both players are equally likely to win, print "EQUAL".

Note that all answers are case-sensitive.

Example

Input


3
3
777
111
3
314
159
5
09281
09281


Output


RED
BLUE
EQUAL

Note

Formally, let n_R be the number of permutations of cards 1, …, n such that the resulting numbers R and B satisfy R > B. Similarly, let n_B be the number of permutations such that R < B. If n_R > n_B, you should print "RED". If n_R < n_B, you should print "BLUE". If n_R = n_B, print "EQUAL".

In the first sample case, R = 777 and B = 111 regardless of the card order, thus Red always wins.

In the second sample case, there are two card orders when Red wins, and four card orders when Blue wins:

  * order 1, 2, 3: 314 > 159;
  * order 1, 3, 2: 341 > 195;
  * order 2, 1, 3: 134 < 519;
  * order 2, 3, 1: 143 < 591;
  * order 3, 1, 2: 431 < 915;
  * order 3, 2, 1: 413 < 951.



Since R < B is more frequent, the answer is "BLUE".

In the third sample case, R = B regardless of the card order, thus the bet is always a draw, and both Red and Blue have zero chance to win.
Annotated Functions:
from __future__ import division, print_function
import sys, math, bisect, itertools

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()

    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_1()` are defined or used within the provided function signature. The function reads input but does not use it in the function body. It returns a list of integers obtained from space-separated inputs on the standard input.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from space-separated inputs on the standard input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1()` accepts no parameters and reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input. It converts these integers into a list and returns this list. There is no validation on the input to ensure that only integers are entered; if non-integer values are entered, `map` will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle cases where the input stream is empty or where the input does not contain any integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the provided function are used, and the function does not take any parameters or return any values. It seems to be a helper function for reading input but is not directly related to solving the problem described. However, based on the context, it should read a space-separated list of integers from input, and these integers are expected to be part of the test cases for the main problem.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program reads a space-separated list of integers from input and returns a map object that applies the int function to each element of the input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element of the input. There are no parameters accepted by the function, and it does not modify any external variables. The function handles the case where the input might be empty, resulting in an empty map object being returned. However, it does not handle cases where the input contains non-integer values, which would raise a `ValueError`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of cards (1 <= a <= 1000), b is a string of length a consisting of digits, and c is a string of length a consisting of digits.
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is greater than `int(c[i])`, and `second` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`.
    if (first > second) :
        print('RED')
    else :
        if (second > first) :
            print('BLUE')
        else :
            print('EQUAL')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is greater than `int(c[i])`, and `second` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`. If `second` is greater than `first`, the string 'BLUE' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they are after evaluating the if-else statement.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is greater than `int(c[i])`, and `second` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`. If `first > second`, no action is taken beyond the condition check. If `second > first`, the string 'BLUE' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they are after evaluating the if-else statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: an integer `a` representing the number of cards (1 <= a <= 1000), and two strings `b` and `c` of equal length `a` consisting of digits. It compares the digits of `b` and `c` character by character, counting the number of positions where the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `c` (`first`) and the number of positions where the digit in `b` is less than the digit in `c` (`second`). Based on the comparison results, it prints either 'RED', 'BLUE', or 'EQUAL' to the console. Specifically, if `first` is greater than `second`, it prints 'RED'. If `second` is greater than `first`, it prints 'BLUE'. If `first` equals `second`, it prints 'EQUAL'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result to the console. Potential edge cases include when `a` is at its minimum (1) or maximum (1000), and the strings `b` and `c` can contain any valid single-digit numbers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and r and b are strings of length n consisting of digits.
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_3()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `num_iterations` is 0, `func_3()` has been executed `T` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function does not define or use the variables `n`, `r`, or `b`, despite the initial annotation suggesting these parameters are passed to the function. Therefore, these variables remain in their initial state after the function execution.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
