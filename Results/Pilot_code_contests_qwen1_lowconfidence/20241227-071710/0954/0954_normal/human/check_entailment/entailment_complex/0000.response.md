Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code assumes that the input strings `b` and `c` will have the same length and will consist of valid digits, but it does not handle cases where the input strings might not meet these criteria. According to the problem description, the input strings `r` and `b` can contain any valid single-digit numbers, meaning they could potentially be of different lengths or contain invalid characters. 

The `func_3` function only compares the digits character by character without checking if the input strings are of the same length. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the input strings are of different lengths. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
123
111
```

In this case, the code will attempt to compare characters at the third position ('3' vs '1'), even though the third position does not exist in `b` for the first string. This will result in an out-of-bounds error, which the current implementation does not handle.

To fix this, the code should include checks to ensure that the input strings are of the same length before attempting to compare their digits. If the strings are of different lengths, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly by considering shorter strings as having trailing zeros or by raising an error to indicate invalid input.

Since the current implementation does not handle this case, the code is not correct according to the problem description.
