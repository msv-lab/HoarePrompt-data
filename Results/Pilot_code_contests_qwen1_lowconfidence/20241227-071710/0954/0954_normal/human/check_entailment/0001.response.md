Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where all digits in the strings `b` and `c` are zeros. According to the problem description, if all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
000
111
```

In this case, both `R` and `B` should be 0, so the result should be "EQUAL". However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "RED" because it does not handle the scenario where all digits are zeros.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if all digits in the strings `b` and `c` are zeros before making a comparison. Here is a corrected version of the function `func_3`:

```python
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    
    # Check if all digits in b are zeros
    if all(digit == '0' for digit in b):
        if all(digit == '0' for digit in c):
            print('EQUAL')
        else:
            print('RED')
        return
    
    # Check if all digits in c are zeros
    if all(digit == '0' for digit in c):
        print('BLUE')
        return
    
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
    if first > second:
        print('RED')
    elif second > first:
        print('BLUE')
    else:
        print('EQUAL')
```

With this correction, the program will handle cases where all digits are zeros correctly.
