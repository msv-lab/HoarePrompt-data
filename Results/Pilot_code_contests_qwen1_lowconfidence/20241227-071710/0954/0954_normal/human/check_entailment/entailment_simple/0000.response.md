Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the logic in `func_3` is flawed because it only compares the individual digits of the red and blue numbers without considering the full permutation of card orders. This means that `func_3` does not correctly simulate all possible permutations of card orders and determine the probability of `R > B` versus `R < B`.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Comparison Logic**: The current implementation in `func_3` only checks if the \(i\)-th digit of the red number is greater than the \(i\)-th digit of the blue number. This is insufficient because the actual value of \(R\) and \(B\) depends on the permutation of all \(n\) cards, not just the \(i\)-th digits.

2. **Permutations Not Considered**: The program should simulate all possible permutations of the cards to compute the exact probabilities of \(R > B\) and \(R < B\). The current implementation only counts the number of positions where the red digit is greater than the blue digit, which does not reflect the full permutation-based probabilities.

3. **Probability Calculation**: To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:
   - Generate all permutations of the card order.
   - For each permutation, calculate the resulting values of \(R\) and \(B\).
   - Count the number of permutations where \(R > B\), \(R < B\), and \(R = B\).
   - Determine the probabilities based on these counts.

### Why the Current Program Fails:
- The program in `func_3` incorrectly assumes that counting the number of positions where red digits are greater than blue digits will give the correct result.
- It fails to account for different permutations and their impact on the final values of \(R\) and \(B\).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution, you would need to generate all permutations of the card order and evaluate the resulting \(R\) and \(B\) for each permutation. Then, count the number of permutations where \(R > B\), \(R < B\), and \(R = B\) to determine the probabilities.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and hence is marked as **False**.
