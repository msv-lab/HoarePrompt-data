Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_3` is defined to take three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the function itself does not use the parameter `a` and instead reads the values of `n`, `r`, and `b` directly from standard input within the function. This means that the function does not correctly match the expected interface as described in the problem statement.

The problem description states that the function should accept `n`, `r`, and `b` as parameters, but the implementation uses `input()` to read these values. This discrepancy indicates that the function does not adhere to the specified interface, making the program incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**.
