Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where all digits are zero. According to the problem description, if all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
000
000
```

The expected output should be "EQUAL" because both `R` and `B` would be 0, making the result a draw. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "RED" because it only compares the counts of digits without properly handling the case where all digits are zero.

To fix this, you can modify the function to explicitly check for this case before performing the digit comparison:
```python
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    
    # Check if all digits are zero
    if all(digit == '0' for digit in b) and all(digit == '0' for digit in c):
        print('EQUAL')
        return
    
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
    
    if first > second:
        print('RED')
    elif second > first:
        print('BLUE')
    else:
        print('EQUAL')
```

With this modification, the program should now handle all cases correctly.
