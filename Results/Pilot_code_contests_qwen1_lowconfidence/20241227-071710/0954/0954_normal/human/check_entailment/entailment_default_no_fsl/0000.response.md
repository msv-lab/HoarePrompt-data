Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_3` does not correctly simulate the shuffling of cards and determining the winner of the bet based on the shuffled order. Instead, it directly compares the strings of red and blue digits character by character without considering all possible permutations of the cards. This means it does not account for the randomness of the card shuffling, which is a critical part of the problem description. For example, consider the following test case:

```
3
123
321
```

In this case, `func_3` would incorrectly compare the strings "123" and "321" character by character, which would lead to the conclusion that the number represented by "123" is greater than "321". However, the actual problem requires us to consider all possible permutations of the cards, and in this specific permutation, "321" is actually greater than "123". Therefore, `func_3` does not handle the problem as described, making the code incorrect.
