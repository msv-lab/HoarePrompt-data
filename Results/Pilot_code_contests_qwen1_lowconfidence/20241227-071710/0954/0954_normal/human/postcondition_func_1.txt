The function `func_2()` reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a map object that applies the `int` function to each element of the input. There are no parameters accepted by the function, and it does not modify any external variables. The function handles the case where the input might be empty, resulting in an empty map object being returned. However, it does not handle cases where the input contains non-integer values, which would raise a `ValueError`.
