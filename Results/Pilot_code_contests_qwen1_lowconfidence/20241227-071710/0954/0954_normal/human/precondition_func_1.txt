None of the variables in the provided function are used, and the function does not take any parameters or return any values. It seems to be a helper function for reading input but is not directly related to solving the problem described. However, based on the context, it should read a space-separated list of integers from input, and these integers are expected to be part of the test cases for the main problem.
