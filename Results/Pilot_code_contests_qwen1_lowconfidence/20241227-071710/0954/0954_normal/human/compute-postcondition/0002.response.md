State at the end of the previous iteration: `T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).

The loop statement is:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To determine the state needed at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens inside the `range()` function. The `range(int(input()))` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `int(input()) - 1`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is the specific integer.
2. For the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 because the `range()` function generates numbers from 0 up to `int(input()) - 1`.
3. Since the loop has already run once, `int(input())` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `T` must be such that when input is taken, the condition `int(input()) > 0` holds true. This means that the next input must be at least 1, ensuring that the loop runs for at least another iteration.

State: **`T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), and the input must be at least 1**.
