Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is 0, and `second` is 1. For all `i` in range `a`, if `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`, then `second` remains 1. Otherwise, `second` remains 1 as well since there is no else part that would change its value.***
