The function `func_3()` is called, but its implementation is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. However, we know that `T` is a specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) and `num_iterations` is the number of remaining iterations after the first execution. Calling `func_3()` does not directly modify these two variables.

Output State: **`T` is a specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `num_iterations` is the number of remaining iterations after the first execution**
