Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State**: The variable `T` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, and `func_3()` has been executed.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations.
3. **Previous Iteration**: We need to determine the state after the previous iteration of the loop.

Since we don't know the exact value of `T`, let's consider the general case where the loop has just completed one iteration. This means that the user has entered an integer value for the number of iterations, and the loop has run once.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Value**: The loop will execute based on the input value provided by the user. Let's denote this input value as `num_iterations`.
2. **Previous Iteration**: After the first iteration of the loop, `num_iterations` would have decreased by 1. Therefore, if the loop ran once, `num_iterations` should now be `num_iterations - 1`.

Given that the loop has just completed its first iteration, we need to adjust the state accordingly:

- `T` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
- The loop has now run once, so the remaining number of iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `num_iterations` is reduced by 1**.

However, since `num_iterations` is derived from user input and not explicitly defined in the state, we can represent it generally as follows:

State: **`T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `num_iterations` is the number of remaining iterations after the first execution**.

To provide a concrete example, if the user input was `5`, then the state would be:

State: **`T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `num_iterations` is 4**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `num_iterations` is the number of remaining iterations after the first execution**.
