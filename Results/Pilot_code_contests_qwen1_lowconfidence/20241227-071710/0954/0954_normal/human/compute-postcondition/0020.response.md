The value of `second` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `a` is a positive integer
- `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits
- `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits
- `first` is set to 2 if for all `i` in range `a`, `int(b[i])` is less than or equal to `int(c[i])`. Otherwise, `first` is set to 0 if there exists at least one index `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`.
- `second` is 2 (initially 1 plus 1)
- `i` is `a`

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is set to 2 if for all `i` in range `a`, `int(b[i])` is less than or equal to `int(c[i])`. Otherwise, `first` is set to 0 if there exists at least one index `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`, `second` is 2, `i` is `a`**
