Output State: **`T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `num_iterations` is 0, `func_3()` has been executed `T` times.**

Explanation:
- The loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` runs for a number of iterations specified by `int(input())`. Since `T` is the input value and it ranges from 1 to 100, the loop will run `T` times.
- After the loop finishes executing, `num_iterations` would be 0 because it starts counting down from `T` and decreases by 1 each time through the loop until it reaches 0.
- `func_3()` is called inside the loop, so it will be executed `T` times.
- The original value of `T` remains unchanged after the loop completes, as the loop does not modify `T`.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `T` will still be within the range of 1 to 100, `num_iterations` will be 0, and `func_3()` will have been executed exactly `T` times.
