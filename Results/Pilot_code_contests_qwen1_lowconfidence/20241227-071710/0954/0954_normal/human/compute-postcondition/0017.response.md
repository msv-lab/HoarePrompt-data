Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits. `first` is set to 2 if for all `i` in range `a`, `int(b[i])` is less than or equal to `int(c[i])`. Otherwise, `first` is set to 0 if there exists at least one index `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`. `second` remains 1 in all cases.***
