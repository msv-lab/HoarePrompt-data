The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `T`, `n`, and `r`, `b`. 
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `r` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of digits.

Based on the given constraints and relationships, the function does not return anything directly mentioned in the problem statement, so we will assume it returns a specific value or type that needs to be determined from the context or further information.

Since no explicit return values are provided in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (an integer between 1 and 100), n (an integer between 1 and 1000), and two strings r and b of length n consisting of digits.**
