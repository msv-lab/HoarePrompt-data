Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is 1 if there exists at least one index `i` where `int(b[i])` is greater than `int(c[i])`, and `first` is 0 while `second` is 1 if for all `i` in range `a`, `int(b[i])` is less than or equal to `int(c[i])`.***
