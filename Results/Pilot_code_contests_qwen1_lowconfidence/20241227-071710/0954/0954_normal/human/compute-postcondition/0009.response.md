Postcondition: **`a` must be greater than 0, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is 0, `second` is 0, and for all `i` in range `a`, `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`. The condition `int(b[i]) < int(c[i])` holds for at least one `i` in the range of `a`.**
