Postcondition: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is greater than `int(c[i])`, and `second` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`. The condition `first > second` holds true.**
