Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts no explicit parameters; instead, it reads an integer `T` from user input, which represents the number of times the function `func_3` should be executed. After executing `func_3` exactly `T` times, the function concludes. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `T` is the integer read from user input, `num_iterations` is 0 (since `num_iterations` is not defined or modified within the function), and `func_3` has been called `T` times. There are no explicitly defined actions on the strings `r` and `b`, nor on the variable `n`.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the user inputs a value for `T` that is less than 1 or greater than 100, the behavior is undefined because the function does not handle such cases.**

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not define or use the variables `n`, `r`, or `b`, despite the initial annotation suggesting these parameters are passed to the function. Therefore, these variables remain in their initial state after the function execution.**
