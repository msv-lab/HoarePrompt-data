The function `func_3()` is called, but the content of this function is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Without knowing what `func_3()` does, we cannot determine the changes to the variables. However, we can state that `func_3()` is executed, and the value of `T` remains unchanged because no assignment or operation is shown to alter `T`.

Output State: **`T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `func_3()` has been executed**
