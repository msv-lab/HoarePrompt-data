Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is greater than `int(c[i])`, and `second` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`. If `first > second`, no action is taken beyond the condition check. If `second > first`, the string 'BLUE' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they are after evaluating the if-else statement.***
