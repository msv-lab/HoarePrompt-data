Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is set to 2 if for all `i` in range `a`, `int(b[i])` is less than or equal to `int(c[i])`, otherwise `first` is set to 0, `second` is always 2, and `i` is `a`***
