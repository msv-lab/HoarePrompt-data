`func_3()` is called, but the implementation of `func_3()` is not provided in the initial state or code snippet. Since the function's behavior is not specified, we cannot determine what changes it might make to the variables. The only information given is that `T` is a specific integer between 1 and 100 and that the input from `int(input())` must be equal to `T`. However, since no variables are updated or assigned within the function call, the only thing we can infer is that `T` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100)**
