Let's break down the given scenario step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information
- `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `r` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of digits.

### For Loop Statement
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The loop runs based on user input. Specifically, the loop will run for the number of times specified by the integer value entered by the user when calling `int(input())`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the value returned by `int(input())` is non-zero. Since `T` is defined as \(1 \leq T \leq 100\), the value of `int(input())` must be within this range for the loop to execute.

### States to Adjust
- **`T`**: The loop will only execute if `int(input())` equals `T`. Therefore, `T` should be set to the value that will be input.
- **Input Value**: The value of `int(input())` must be exactly `T`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes, the initial state should include `T` being set to the value that will be input, and the input itself must match `T`.

### Final Answer
State: **`T` is the specific integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) that will be input, and the input from `int(input())` must be equal to `T`**
