The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. `a` is an integer representing the number of cards (1 <= a <= 1000), `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, and `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits. Based on the provided cases, the function returns different values depending on the conditions met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept an integer `a`, and two strings `b` and `c` of equal length `a` consisting of digits, and return a specific value based on the given conditions.
