Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits. If there exists at least one index `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`, `first` is set to 0. Otherwise, `first` remains 1 and `second` remains 1.***
