The code `print('EQUAL')` simply prints the string 'EQUAL' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is greater than `int(c[i])`, and `second` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`, with the condition that `second` is not greater than `first`.**
