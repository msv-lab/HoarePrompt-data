Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `c` is a string of length `a` consisting of digits, `first` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is greater than `int(c[i])`, `second` is the count of indices `i` where `int(b[i])` is less than `int(c[i])`, and the current value of `second` is greater than `first`***
