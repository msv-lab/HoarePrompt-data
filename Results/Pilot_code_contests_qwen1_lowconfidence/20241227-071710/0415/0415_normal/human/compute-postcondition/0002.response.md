Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `delta` and prompts the user to input a list of integers. It then returns a new list where each integer in the input list is incremented by the value of `delta`. This process covers all input values, including the case where the input list might be empty or contain non-integer values (though such cases would result in an error). If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will raise a ValueError.**

Note: The annotation mentions that the function takes a list of integers as input from the user, but the actual code uses `raw_input().split()`, which implies that the user inputs a string separated by spaces, and each element is converted to an integer. Therefore, if the input string cannot be split into valid integers, a `ValueError` will be raised.
