The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `delta`. `delta` is a non-negative integer. The function takes a list of integers as input from the user and returns a list of integers, each obtained by adding the value of `delta` to the corresponding integer in the input list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `delta` and return a list of integers, where each integer in the list is the result of adding `delta` to the corresponding integer in the input list.
