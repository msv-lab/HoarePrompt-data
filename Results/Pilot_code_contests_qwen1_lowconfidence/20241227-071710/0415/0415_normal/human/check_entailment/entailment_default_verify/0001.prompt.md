You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.

Let's consider a rooted undirected tree with n vertices, numbered 1 through n. There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p1, p2, ..., pn, where pi denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent).

<image> For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2].

Given a sequence p1, p2, ..., pn, one is able to restore a tree:

  1. There must be exactly one index r that pr = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree. 
  2. For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex pi. 



A sequence p1, p2, ..., pn is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.

You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n).

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.

In the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a1, a2, ..., an) in the minimum number of changes. If there are many such sequences, any of them will be accepted.

Examples

Input

4
2 3 3 4


Output

1
2 3 4 4 


Input

5
3 2 2 5 3


Output

0
3 2 2 5 3 


Input

8
2 3 5 4 1 6 6 7


Output

2
2 3 7 8 1 6 6 7

Note

In the first sample, it's enough to change one element. In the provided output, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because p4 = 4), which you can see on the left drawing below. One of other correct solutions would be a sequence 2 3 3 2, representing a tree rooted in vertex 3 (right drawing below). On both drawings, roots are painted red.

In the second sample, the given sequence is already valid.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the problem constraints and requirements. Specifically, the solution does not ensure that the resulting sequence is a valid tree representation. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Root Identification**: The solution attempts to identify roots by checking if `p[i] == i`. However, it does not properly ensure that there is exactly one root. This can lead to multiple roots being identified, which is not allowed.

2. **Cycle Detection and Handling**: The solution uses union-find (disjoint-set) to detect cycles but does not handle the issue of identifying and fixing the minimum number of changes required to make the sequence valid.

3. **Example Counter-Case**:
   - Consider the input `5 3 2 2 5 3`. The provided solution incorrectly outputs `0` and `3 2 2 5 3`, which is valid. However, the correct solution should not change anything since the sequence is already valid.
   - Now consider another input `5 2 3 3 5 4`. The solution incorrectly outputs `1` and `2 3 4 4 5 4`, which does not form a valid tree. The correct output should be `0` and `2 3 3 5 4`.

To fix these issues, the solution needs to properly identify and handle the root, and ensure that the final sequence forms a valid tree with no cycles and exactly one root. The provided code fails to do so in various cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `delta` and prompts the user to input a list of integers. It then returns a new list where each integer in the input list is incremented by the value of `delta`. This process covers all input values, including the case where the input list might be empty or contain non-integer values (though such cases would result in an error). If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will raise a ValueError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
