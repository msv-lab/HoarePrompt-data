Postcondition: ***`ans` is '1', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 29, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `c0` is the count of '0' at index 29 in all elements of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index 29 in all elements of `s`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is the maximum of its previous value and the integer value of the first 29 bits of `s[i]` (where `i` is either 2 or 3), `mx1` is 1 or the maximum of 1 and the integer value of the first 29 characters of `s[i]` reversed (depending on the condition), `leftp` is 536870912, and `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition.***
