The code snippet `print(a1)` does not modify any variables; it simply prints the value of `a1`. Since `a1` is defined as the maximum of its current value and `leftp ^ i` for all `i` in `a`, and `a` is an empty list, `a1` remains unchanged from its initial value. Given the initial state, `a1` is the maximum of its current value (which is 0 because the list `a` is empty) and `leftp ^ i` for all `i` in an empty list, which means `a1` stays at 0.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be 0.

Output State: **`ans` is "0" or "1", `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j \leq 31\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `ans`, `ansl` and `ansr` are -1, `a1` is 0, and the print statement outputs 0.**
