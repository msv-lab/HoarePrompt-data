The code assigns the value of `leftp + mx1` to `ansr`. The variables `i`, `n`, `s`, `mx0`, `mx1`, and `ansl` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `mx0` is the maximum value among all `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` for `s[i][j] == '0'` across all iterations, `mx1` is the maximum value among all `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` for `s[i][j] == '1'` across all iterations, `ansl` is `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`**
