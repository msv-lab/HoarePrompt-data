Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is "0" or "1".
   - `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j \leq 31\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary.
   - `brk` is -1.
   - `leftp` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `ans`.
   - `ansl` and `ansr` are -1.
   - `a1` is \(\max(a1, \text{leftp} \oplus i)\).

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over the list `a`, the next element in the list `a` will be taken as `i`.
   - The list `a` will have one less element after this iteration.
   - All other states remain the same except for the current element `i` which changes to the next element in `a`.

5. **Final State After the Next Iteration:**
   - `ans` remains "0" or "1".
   - `j` remains an integer such that \(0 \leq j \leq 31\).
   - `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` now has one less element (the next element in the list is taken as `i` for the next iteration).
   - `s` remains unchanged as it was generated from the original list `a`.
   - `brk` remains -1.
   - `leftp` remains 0 or 1 depending on the value of `ans`.
   - `ansl` and `ansr` remain -1.
   - `a1` is updated to \(\max(a1, \text{leftp} \oplus \text{next element in } a)\).

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`ans` is "0" or "1", `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j \leq 31\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n-1` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `ans`, `ansl` and `ansr` are -1, `a1` is \(\max(a1, \text{leftp} \oplus \text{next element in } a)\).**
