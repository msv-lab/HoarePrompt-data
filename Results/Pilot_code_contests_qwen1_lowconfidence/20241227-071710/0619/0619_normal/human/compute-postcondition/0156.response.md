Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 29, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `i` is 31, and `c1` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `s[31][j]` is '0', `c0` is incremented by 1, otherwise `c1` is incremented by 1.***
