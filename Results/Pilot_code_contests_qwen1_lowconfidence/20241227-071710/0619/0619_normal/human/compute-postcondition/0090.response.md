Postcondition: ***`j` is 31, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is either "0" or "1", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is the count of '0's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c1` is the count of '1's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`. If `c1` equals `n`, then `ans` is "1". If `c0` equals `n`, then `ans` is "0". Otherwise, `ans` is "1", `leftp` is set to 2147483648, `ansl` is set to `2147483648 + mx0`, and `ansr` is set to `2147483648 + mx1`, where `mx0` is the maximum value of the integer value of the first 31 bits of the reversed binary representation of the integers in `a` where the j-th bit is '0', and `mx1` is the maximum value of the integer value of the first 31 bits of the reversed binary representation of the integers in `a` where the j-th bit is '1'.***
