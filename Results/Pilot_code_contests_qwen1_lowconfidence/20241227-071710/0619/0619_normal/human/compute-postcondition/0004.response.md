The given code snippet `ts = bin(i)[2:]` has an issue in the context provided because `i` is not defined. However, assuming the intention was to convert an integer `i` to its binary representation and remove the '0b' prefix, let's proceed with the assumption that `i` is a placeholder for an integer value from the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers that must contain at least one element
- `s` is an empty list

The code `ts = bin(i)[2:]` converts the integer `i` to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. Since `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `ts` will be a binary string representation of `i`.

Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, the only thing that changes is the creation of the variable `ts` which holds the binary representation of `i`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers that must contain at least one element, `s` is an empty list, `ts` is the binary representation of an integer `i` without the '0b' prefix.**
