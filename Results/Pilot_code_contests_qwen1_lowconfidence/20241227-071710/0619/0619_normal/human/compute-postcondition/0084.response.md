Postcondition: ***`j` is 31, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a` with each string being exactly 32 characters long, `ans` is '1', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 2147483648, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `c0` and `c1` are updated based on the 31st bit position of the current integer in `a`. If `s[i][j]` is '0', `mx0` is the maximum of -1 and the integer value of the reversed first 31 bits of the binary representation of the integer at index `i` in the list `s`. Otherwise, `mx1` is the integer value of `s[1][:31][::-1]` (or `s[0][:31][::-1]` if `i` is 1).***
