Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 29, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` in all elements of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` in all elements of `s`. If `c1` equals `n`, then `ans` is its initial value plus '1'. Otherwise, if `c0` equals `n`, `ans` is '0'. Otherwise, `ansl` is `536870912 + mx0`, `ansr` is `536870912 + mx1`, where `mx0` is the maximum value of the integer values of the first 29 bits of `s[i]` where `s[i][j]` is '0', and `mx1` is the maximum value of the integer values of the first 29 bits of `s[i]` where `s[i][j]` is '1'.***
