The code snippet `mx1 = max(mx1, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))` impacts the variable `mx1`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `s[i][:j][::-1]` extracts a substring from `s[i]` from the beginning up to (but not including) the `j`-th character, and then reverses this substring.
2. `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` converts this reversed substring back to an integer, treating it as a binary number.
3. `mx1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer obtained from the above conversion.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 31.
- `s[i]` is a 32-character long string representing the reversed binary form of an integer in `a`.
- The j-th bit of every string in `s` is '1' (since `s[i][j] != '0'`).

Let's consider the substring `s[i][:j]` which includes the first 31 bits of the reversed binary representation of an integer in `a`. Reversing this substring gives us the last 31 bits of the original binary representation of the integer. Converting this reversed substring to an integer using base 2 will give us the value of these 31 bits interpreted as a binary number.

Since every `s[i][j]` is '1', the j-th bit is set in the original integer. Therefore, the maximum value that `mx1` can take when considering the j-th bit is the maximum of the current `mx1` and the value represented by the first 31 bits of the binary number, which is a number between 0 and 2^31 - 1 (inclusive).

However, without knowing the exact values of `s[i]` or the current value of `mx1`, we can only say that `mx1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the first 31 bits of the reversed binary representation of the integer in `a`.

Output State: **`j` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is `'1'`, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 2147483648, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is the count of '0's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c1` is the count of '1's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `s[i][j]` is '1', `mx1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the first 31 bits of the reversed binary representation of the integer in `a`.**
