The code `ts = bin(i)[2:]` converts the integer `i` to its binary representation using the `bin` function and then slices off the '0b' prefix. The resulting string `ts` will be a binary string of length 32, with all characters being '0'. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `s`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n-1` integers, `s` is a list containing the string '00000000000000000000000000000000', and `ts` is the binary string '00000000000000000000000000000000'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n-1` integers, `s` is a list containing the string '00000000000000000000000000000000', `ts` is the binary string '00000000000000000000000000000000'**
