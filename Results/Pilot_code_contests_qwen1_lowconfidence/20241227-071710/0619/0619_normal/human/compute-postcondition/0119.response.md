The code `leftp <<= j` left shifts `leftp` by `j` positions. Given that `j` is 30, `leftp` (which is initially 1) will be left shifted by 30 positions.

- Initially, `leftp` is 1, which in binary is `00000000000000000000000000000001`.
- Left shifting this by 30 positions results in `10000000000000000000000000000000`, which is 2^30 in decimal, or 1073741824.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `j` is 30; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary; `ans` is "1"; `brk` is -1; `leftp` is 1073741824; `ansl` is -1; `ansr` is -1; `c0` is the total number of '0's at position `j` in the strings of `s`, and `c0` is less than `n`; `c1` is the total number of '1's at position `j` in the strings of `s`; `mx0` is 0; `mx1` is 0**
