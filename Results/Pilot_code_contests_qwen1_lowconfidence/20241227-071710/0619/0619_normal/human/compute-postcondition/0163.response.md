Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 29, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` in all elements of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` in all elements of `s`, and `c0` is not equal to `n`**
