`mx0` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value (5) and the value of `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)`. However, the values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `j` are not provided, making it impossible to determine the exact new value of `mx0`. We know that `mx0` will be updated to the maximum of 5 and the integer value obtained from `s[i][:j][::-1]` when interpreted in base 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings, `mx0` is the maximum of 5 and the integer value of `s[2][:j][::-1]` in base 2**
