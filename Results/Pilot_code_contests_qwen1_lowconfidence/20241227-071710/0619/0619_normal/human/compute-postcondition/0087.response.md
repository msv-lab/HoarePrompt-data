The code `ansr = leftp + mx1` updates the value of `ansr`. Before this line, `ansr` is `-1`, `leftp` is `2147483648`, and `mx1` is some value derived from the integers in list `a` and their reversed binary representations.

After executing this line, `ansr` is updated to `leftp + mx1`, which is `2147483648 + mx1`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`j` is 31, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, `ans` is `'1'`, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 2147483648, `ansl` is `2147483648 + mx0`, `ansr` is `2147483648 + mx1`, `c0` is the count of '0's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c1` is the count of '1's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `mx0` is the maximum value of the integer value of the first 31 bits of the reversed binary representation of the integers in `a` where the j-th bit is '0', and `mx1` is the maximum value of the integer value of the first 31 bits of the reversed binary representation of the integers in `a` where the j-th bit is '1'.**
