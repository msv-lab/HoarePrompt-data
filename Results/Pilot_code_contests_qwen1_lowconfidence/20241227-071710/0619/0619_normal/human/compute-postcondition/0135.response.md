The code `ansl = leftp + mx0` assigns the value of `leftp + mx0` to the variable `ansl`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `mx0`, and `mx1` are not directly used in this assignment, so they remain unchanged. The variable `ansl` is introduced with the value `leftp + mx0`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `mx0` is the maximum value among all `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` for `s[i][j] == '0'` across all iterations, `mx1` is the maximum value among all `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` for `s[i][j] == '1'` across all iterations, `ansl` is `leftp + mx0`**
