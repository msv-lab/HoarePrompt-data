The code `mx1 = max(mx1, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))` impacts the following:

- `mx1` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)`. Here, `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` converts the slice `s[i][:j][::-1]` (a reversed substring of `s[i]` from index 0 to `j-1`) to an integer in base 2 (binary).
- The variables `i` and `j` are not affected by this line of code.
- The variable `s` is not defined in the initial state, and thus cannot be updated or referenced.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s[i][j]` is not '0'

Since `i` is 0, the expression `s[i][:j][::-1]` becomes `s[0][:j][::-1]`, which is a reversed substring of `s[0]` from index 0 to `j-1`.

The exact value of `mx1` depends on its initial value, which is not specified. However, it is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the binary conversion of the substring.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `s[i][j]` is not '0'; `mx1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the binary conversion of the substring `s[0][:j][::-1]`.**
