`c1` is incremented by 1. The value of `c1` was 0 before this operation, so it now becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `j` is 30, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is either "0" or "1", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 1, and `s[i][j]` is not '0'.**
