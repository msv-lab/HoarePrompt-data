`ans` is a string that was initially either "0" or "1". The code `ans += '1'` appends the character '1' to the string `ans`. Since `ans` could be either "0" or "1", appending '1' will change its value to "11" if it was initially "0", or it will remain "11" if it was already "1". The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `j` is 30, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is "11", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is the total number of '0's at position `j` in the strings of `s`, `c1` is the total number of '1's at position `j` in the strings of `s` (and remains equal to `n`).**
