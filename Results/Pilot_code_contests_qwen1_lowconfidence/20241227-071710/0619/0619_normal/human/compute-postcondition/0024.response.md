`s` is a list containing the string '000000000000000000000000000000000'. The code appends `ts` to the list `s`. Since `ts` is equal to '0000000000000000000000000000000000', `s` will now contain two identical strings.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n-1` integers, `s` is a list containing ['000000000000000000000000000000000', '0000000000000000000000000000000000'], `ts` is '0000000000000000000000000000000000'**
