Postcondition: **`j` is 31, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, each string in `s` is exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` and `c1` retain their values based on the given conditions: if `s[0][31]` is '0', then `c0` is 2 (if initially 1) or 1 (if initially 0), and `c1` is 2 or 1 depending on its initial value.**
