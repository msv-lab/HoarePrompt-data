Postcondition: ***`j` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, each string in `s` is exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is either 1 or 0, `c1` is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of `s[i][j]` for some valid index `i` where `0 â‰¤ i < n`: if `s[i][j]` is '0', `c0` is 1 and `c1` is 0; otherwise, `c0` is 0 and `c1` is 1.***
