The code `leftp <<= j` shifts the bits of `leftp` to the left by `j` positions, where `j` is 31. Initially, `leftp` is 1, which in binary is `00000000000000000000000000000001`. Shifting this value to the left by 31 positions results in `10000000000000000000000000000000`, which is the binary representation of `2147483648`.

All other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`j` is 31, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is `'1'`, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 2147483648, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is the count of '0's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c1` is the count of '1's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0**
