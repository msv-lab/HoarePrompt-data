Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings. If `s[0][j]` equals '0', then `mx0` is the maximum of its original value and the binary value of `s[0][:j]`. Otherwise, `mx1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the binary conversion of the substring `s[0][:j][::-1]`.***
