`c0` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c0` is either 1 or 0, so after incrementing, `c0` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or 1 if it was initially 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 31, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, each string in `s` is exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is 2 if it was initially 1, or 1 if it was initially 0, `c1` is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of `s[0][31]`.**
