`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`. The raw_input function reads a line from input, which is typically a string, and then `int` converts it to an integer. This sets the value of `n`. The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1.**
