Output State: **`ans` is "0" or "1", `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j \leq 31\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `0` integers (i.e., `a` is an empty list), `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in an empty list, which is also an empty list, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `ans`, `ansl` and `ansr` are -1, `a1` is the maximum of its current value and `leftp ^ i` for all `i` in `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Values:** Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where `1 \leq n \leq 10^5`. The loop iterates over each element `i` in `a`.
- **Loop Operation:** For each iteration, `a1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `leftp ^ i`.
- **Final Values:**
  - Since the loop iterates over all elements in `a`, after the loop completes, `a` becomes an empty list (`[]`), because each element is processed and removed from the list.
  - `a1` will be the maximum of `leftp` XORed with each element in `a` because `leftp` remains unchanged and `i` takes each value in `a` during the iterations.
  - Other variables like `ans`, `j`, `n`, `s`, `brk`, `leftp`, `ansl`, and `ansr` do not change their values throughout the loop based on the provided information and remain as they were initially or as specified.

Thus, after the loop completes, `a` is an empty list, and `a1` contains the maximum result of `leftp ^ i` for all `i` in the original `a`.
