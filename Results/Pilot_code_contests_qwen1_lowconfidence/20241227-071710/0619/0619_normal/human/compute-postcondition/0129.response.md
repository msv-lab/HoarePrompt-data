Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings. If the character at position `j` in the string `s[i]` is '0', then `mx0` remains unchanged (which is 5). Otherwise, `mx1` is the maximum of its initial value and the integer value obtained by reversing the binary string slice of `s[i]` up to index `j`.***
