Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `j` is 30, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is either "0" or "1", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` and `c1` count the number of '0's and '1's at position `j` in the strings of `s` respectively. If `s[i][j]` is '0', `c0` is incremented by 1. If `s[i][j]` is not '0', `c1` is incremented by 1.***
