Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `j` is 30, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary. If `c1 == n`, then `ans` is "11". Otherwise, `ans` is "00". `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is the total number of '0's at position `j` in the strings of `s`, `c1` is less than `n` and is the total number of '1's at position `j` in the strings of `s`, and if `c0` is not equal to `n`, then `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of strings, `mx0` is the maximum value among all `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` for `s[i][j] == '0'` across all iterations, `mx1` is the maximum value among all `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)` for `s[i][j] == '1'` across all iterations, `ansl` is `leftp + mx0`, `ansr` is `leftp + mx1`.***
