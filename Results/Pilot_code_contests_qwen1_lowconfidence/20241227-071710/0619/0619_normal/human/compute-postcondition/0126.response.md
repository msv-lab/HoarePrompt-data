Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is a list of strings

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Current Values After Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0 (end of the previous iteration)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is a list of strings (no specific values provided)

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` was 0 and it needs to be incremented to 1, `i` will now be 1.
   - The condition `n > 0` remains the same because `n` has not changed.
   - `s` is still a list of strings and no additional information about its contents is given, so we keep it as a list of strings.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings**
