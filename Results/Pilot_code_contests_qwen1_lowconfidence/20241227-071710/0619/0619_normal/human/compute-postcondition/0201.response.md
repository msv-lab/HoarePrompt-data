Postcondition: `ans` is "0" or "1", `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j \leq 31\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is -1, `ansl` and `ansr` are -1 if `ans` is "0", otherwise `ansl` is `2147483648 + mx0` and `ansr` is `2147483648 + mx1`, where `mx0` is the maximum value of the integer value of the first `j` bits of `s[i]` where `s[i][j]` is '0', and `mx1` is the maximum value of the integer value of the first `j` bits of `s[i]` where `s[i][j]` is '1'.
