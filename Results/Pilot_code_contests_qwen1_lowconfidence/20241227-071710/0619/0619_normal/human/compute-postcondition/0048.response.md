Postcondition: **`j` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, each string in `s` is exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, and for all valid indices `i` where `0 ≤ i < n`, the character at position `j` in the string `s[i]` is `'1'`**
