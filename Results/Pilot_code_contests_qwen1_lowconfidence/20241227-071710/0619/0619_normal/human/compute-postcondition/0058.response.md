Postcondition: ***`j` is 31, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1. If `s[i][j]` is '0', then `c0` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `c1` is set to 1.***
