`ans` is a string that gets its value updated by concatenating `'1'` to the existing string. Initially, `ans` is an empty string, so after executing `ans += '1'`, `ans` becomes `'1'`. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and the rest of the variables are also not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 31, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is `'1'`, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is the count of '0's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c1` is the count of '1's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0**
