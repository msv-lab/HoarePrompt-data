Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 29, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, and if `s[i][j]` is '0', `c0` is 1 more than its original value; otherwise, `c1` is increased by 1.**
