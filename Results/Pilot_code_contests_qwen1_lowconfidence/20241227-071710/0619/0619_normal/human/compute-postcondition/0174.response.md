Postcondition: ***`ans` is '1', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 29, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` in all elements of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` in all elements of `s`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, `mx0` is `val`, `mx1` is 1, `leftp` is 536870912, and `i` is 0 if `s[i][j]` is '0'. Otherwise, `mx1` is 1 and `i` is 0.***
