The code `leftp <<= j` shifts the bits of `leftp` to the left by `j` positions. Given that `j` is 29, `leftp` will be multiplied by \(2^{29}\). Initially, `leftp` is 1.

So, the new value of `leftp` will be:
\[ leftp = 1 \times 2^{29} = 536870912 \]

All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`ans` is '1', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 29, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `c0` is the count of '0' at index `j` in all elements of `s`, `c1` is the count of '1' at index `j` in all elements of `s`, and `c0` is not equal to `n`; `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `leftp` is 536870912**
