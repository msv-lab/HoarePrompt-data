Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n-1` integers.
   - `s` is a list containing the string '00000000000000000000000000000000'.
   - `ts` is the binary string '00000000000000000000000000000000'.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `len(ts) < 32`.

3. **Current Condition**:
   - Right before the loop starts, `ts` is '00000000000000000000000000000000', which means `len(ts)` is 32.

4. **Required Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at least one more time, `len(ts)` must be less than 32.

5. **Adjustment Needed**:
   - Since `len(ts)` is currently 32, we need to adjust the state so that `len(ts)` is less than 32 before the loop starts. This can be achieved by modifying `ts` to be a string of length 31 or less.

Given these steps, the necessary adjustment is to change `ts` to a string of length 31 or less. Therefore, the required state before the loop can proceed is:

**State: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n-1` integers, `s` is a list containing the string '00000000000000000000000000000000', `ts` is a binary string of length 31 or less**.
