Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s` is a list of strings
   - `mx0` remains unchanged (which is 5)
   - The loop body involves checking if the character at position `j` in the string `s[i]` is '0'. If it is, `mx0` remains 5. Otherwise, `mx1` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer value obtained by reversing the binary string slice of `s[i]` up to index `j`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` because the previous iteration ended with `i = 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment to `2` (since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time).
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, `n` remains the same but `i` needs to be 2.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` should be 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `s` remains a list of strings.
   - `mx0` remains unchanged at 5.
   - `mx1` may or may not be updated depending on the value of `s[2]` and the specific value of `j` within the loop body, but this information is not provided for the next iteration start.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings, `mx0` is 5**
