The variable `brk` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30} - 1\), `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, each string in `s` is exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary; `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1.**
