`ts` is a string containing the reversed binary representation of an integer `i` without the '0b' prefix and its length is less than 32. The code appends '0' to `ts`. Therefore, the new value of `ts` is the original `ts` plus '0'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers that must contain at least one element, `s` is an empty list, `ts` is the reversed binary representation of an integer `i` without the '0b' prefix followed by '0' and its length is less than 32**
