Postcondition: **`j` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is `'1'`, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 2147483648, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `c0` is the count of '0's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c1` is the count of '1's in the j-th bit position of the reversed binary representations of the integers in `a`, `c0` is not equal to `n`, and for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `s[i][j] != '0'`**
