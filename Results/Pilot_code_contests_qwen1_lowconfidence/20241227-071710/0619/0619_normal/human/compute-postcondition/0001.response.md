The code `a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1, and `a` is now updated to reflect the integers entered by the user.**
