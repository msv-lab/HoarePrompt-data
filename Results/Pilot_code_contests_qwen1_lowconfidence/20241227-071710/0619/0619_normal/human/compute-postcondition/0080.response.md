Postcondition: ***`j` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `ans` is '1', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 2147483648, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition, `c0` is the count of '0's in the 31st bit position of the reversed binary representation of the first integer in `a`, `c1` is the count of '1's in the 31st bit position of the reversed binary representation of the first integer in `a`, and `mx0` and `mx1` are updated according to the 31st bit position of the first element in `s`. If the first element of `s` has a '0' in the 31st bit position, `mx0` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer value of the first 31 bits of the reversed binary representation of the first integer in `a`, otherwise `mx0` remains unchanged and `mx1` is updated accordingly.***
