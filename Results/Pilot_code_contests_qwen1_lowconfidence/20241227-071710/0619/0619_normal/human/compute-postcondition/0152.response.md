Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 29, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, and if `s[i][j]` is '0', `c0` is incremented by 1, otherwise `c1` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `c1` is always incremented by 1 regardless of the condition. `i` is 30.***
