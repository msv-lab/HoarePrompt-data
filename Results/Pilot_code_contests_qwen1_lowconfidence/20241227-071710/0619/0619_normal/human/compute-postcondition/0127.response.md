The initial state of the variables is as follows:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s` is a list of strings

The code snippet is:
```python
mx0 = max(mx0, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))
```

To analyze this step-by-step:

1. The variable `mx0` is being updated using the `max()` function.
2. The `max()` function requires two arguments: `mx0` (the current maximum value) and a new value that is being compared.
3. The new value is generated from `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)`.

However, there are a few issues with the code:
- The variable `mx0` is used in the `max()` function but it is not defined before this line. This will cause a NameError unless `mx0` is defined somewhere else in the code.
- The variable `j` is used in the slicing operation `s[i][:j]`, but `j` is not defined in the given context.

Given these issues, let's assume the following for the sake of analysis:
- `mx0` is initially some value, say `mx0 = 0`.
- `j` is a value that allows the slicing operation to be valid (e.g., `j` is the length of `s[i]`).

Assuming `s[1]` is a string like "101", and `j` is the length of `s[1]`, which is 3, the code will evaluate as follows:
- `s[i][:j]` will be `s[1][:3]`, which is "101".
- `[::-1]` reverses the string, so "101" becomes "101".
- `int("101", 2)` converts the binary string "101" to its integer representation, which is `5`.

So, `mx0` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `5`. If `mx0` was `0` initially, `mx0` will now be `5`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of strings, `mx0` is 5**
