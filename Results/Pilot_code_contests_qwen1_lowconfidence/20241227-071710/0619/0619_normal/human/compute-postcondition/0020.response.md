The code `ts += '0'` appends the string `'0'` to `ts`. Initially, `ts` is set to `'00000000000000000000000000000000'`. After appending `'0'` to `ts`, the new value of `ts` becomes `'000000000000000000000000000000000'`.

The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n-1` integers, `s` is a list containing the string '00000000000000000000000000000000', `ts` is '000000000000000000000000000000000'**
