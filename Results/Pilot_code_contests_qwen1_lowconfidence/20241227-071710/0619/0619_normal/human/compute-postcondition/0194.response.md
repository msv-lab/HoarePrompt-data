Output State: **`ans` is "0" or "1", `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j \leq 31\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary representation of each integer in `a`, with each string in `s` being exactly 32 characters long, padded with leading zeros if necessary, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `ans`, `ansl` and `ansr` are -1, `a1` is max(`a1`, `leftp` ^ `i`).**

Note: The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but the operation `leftp ^ i` indicates that `i` should be an integer used in the bitwise XOR operation. Since `i` is not defined before this operation, its exact value is unknown, but it does not affect the general structure of the output state.
