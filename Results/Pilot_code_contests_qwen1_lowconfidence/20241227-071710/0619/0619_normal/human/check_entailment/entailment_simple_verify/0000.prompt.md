You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Examples

Input

Note

In the first sample, we can choose X = 3.

In the second sample, we can choose X = 5.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using bitwise operations but has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Handling of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is used to construct a binary string representing the optimal `X`, but the program's logic to determine whether to append '0' or '1' to `ans` is flawed. Specifically, the logic to handle cases where both '0' and '1' are present in the current bit position does not correctly minimize the maximum XOR value.

2. **Bitwise Operations and String Manipulation**: The program converts each integer to a binary string, reverses it, and appends zeros to ensure a length of 32 bits. However, this approach is unnecessary and complicates the solution. Instead, directly manipulating the integer values is more straightforward.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Optimal `X`**: The logic to determine the optimal `X` is incomplete and does not correctly handle the bitwise XOR operation across all elements in the array. The program tries to find the maximum value of `X` that minimizes the maximum XOR, but the implementation does not accurately reflect the intended logic.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work correctly:
- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  1 2 3
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  2
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  The program outputs `3` instead of `2`.

To fix the program, a more straightforward approach would be to construct the optimal `X` by comparing the most significant bits of the numbers. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(30, -1, -1):
        mask = 1 << i
        ones = sum(x & mask > 0 for x in a)
        if ones >= (n // 2) + (n % 2):
            ans |= mask
    print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program works by iterating from the most significant bit to the least significant bit and constructing the optimal `X` by setting bits that are present in more than half of the numbers.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
