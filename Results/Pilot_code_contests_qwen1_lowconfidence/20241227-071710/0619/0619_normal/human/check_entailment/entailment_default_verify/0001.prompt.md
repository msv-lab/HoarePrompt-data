You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the optimal `X` value is flawed. Here’s an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 7
```

The program attempts to construct the binary representation of `X` bit by bit, but its logic for deciding the bits of `X` is incorrect. It tries to maximize the number of zeros or ones in each bit position, but this approach doesn’t guarantee the minimum possible value of \(\max_{1 \leq i \leq n} (a_i \oplus X)\).

For the given input, the correct output should be `1`, which can be achieved by setting `X = 7`. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it constructs `X` in such a way that the maximum XOR result is minimized. A more effective approach would involve iterating through each bit position and choosing the bit value of `X` to balance the maximum XOR result across all inputs.

Since the provided program does not handle all cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a list of integers `a` and determines the minimum possible value of the bitwise XOR operation between an integer and the maximum possible value derived from certain conditions. Specifically, the function first reverses the binary representation of each integer in `a` and pads it to 32 bits. It then iterates over the bits from the most significant to the least significant, calculating the maximum possible values that can be obtained by flipping each bit. If all bits are '1', it directly outputs the result based on `ans`. Otherwise, it computes two values, `ansl` and `ansr`, representing the maximum possible values when the current bit is '0' or '1', respectively. Finally, it prints the minimum of either the maximum possible value or the maximum XOR value obtained by flipping the bits.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
