The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun` (an integer representing a coordinate in the maze), `target` (an integer representing the goal coordinate), and `used_coords` (a set of integers representing coordinates that have already been visited). It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the neighboring coordinates of `jibun` that have not been visited yet. If the `target` coordinate is found during the exploration, it returns the string `'found'`. If the `target` is not found, it returns a list of all explored coordinates starting from `jibun` that do not match `target`.
