The code appends the value of `child` to the list `childs`. Since `child` is not specified to have a particular value, we can denote it as a general variable. The initial state includes that `jibun` is a valid coordinate in the `graph` dictionary, and `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element. However, since the code does not affect these variables, their states remain unchanged.

The impact of the code is that the `childs` list now includes the `child` value. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the `graph` dictionary, and `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element; `childs` is a list containing at least one element which is `child`.**
