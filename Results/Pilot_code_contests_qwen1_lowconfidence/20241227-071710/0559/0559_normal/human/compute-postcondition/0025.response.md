`next_childs` is incremented by the value of `res`. If `res` equals 'found', the function would return `cur_depth + 1`, but since the code only increments `next_childs` by `res` and does not perform any return operation, the value of `cur_depth` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur_depth` is the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration; `next_childs` is incremented by the value of `res`.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration; `next_childs` is incremented by the value of `res`.**
