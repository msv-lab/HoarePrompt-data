According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in `childs`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are provided:

- `total` remains the same
- `i` remains the same
- `cur_depth` remains the same
- `used_coords` remains unchanged
- `next_childs` contains its original elements plus the elements of `res`
- `childs` must contain at least one element
- `graph` remains unchanged
- `coord1` remains the same
- `coord2` remains the same
- `depth_dict` remains a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`
- The program returns `cur_depth + 1` if `res == 'found'`. Otherwise, no change in the program state.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. `childs` must contain at least one element (it already does, based on the given information).
2. The loop needs to start with the next element in `childs`.

Since the loop starts with `child` being an element from `childs`, and assuming that `child` was used in the previous iteration, the next iteration will use the next element in `childs`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the current `child` being used, which will be the next element in the list.

State: **`total` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` remains unchanged, `next_childs` contains its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` must contain at least two elements, `graph` remains unchanged, `coord1` remains the same, `coord2` remains the same, `depth_dict` remains a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, and the program continues execution with the next `child` in the list.**
