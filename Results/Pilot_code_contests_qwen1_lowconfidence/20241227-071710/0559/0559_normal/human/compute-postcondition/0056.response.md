Postcondition: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` includes all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `childs`, `next_childs` is unchanged, `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `childs` contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, and the result of the function call `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is 'found'**
