Postcondition: ***`jibun` is a valid coordinate that exists in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element, and `child` is not equal to `target`. After the execution of the if-else block, `child` is either added to `used_coords` (if it was not already in `used_coords`), or the condition `child not in used_coords` does not hold, hence no action is taken.***
