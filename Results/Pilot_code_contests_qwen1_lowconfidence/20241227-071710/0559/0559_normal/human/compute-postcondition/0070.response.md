Output State: **`cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` includes all unique coordinates visited during the search, `next_childs` becomes an empty list if no further search is required, `childs` is an empty list if no further search is required, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to iterate as long as there are elements in `childs`. Each iteration processes each element in `childs` and updates `next_childs` and `used_coords`.
- If `res` is `'found'`, the function returns immediately with `cur_depth + 1`, indicating that the path to `coord2` has been found.
- If `res` is not `'found'`, `next_childs` is updated with the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.
- As the loop continues, `childs` eventually becomes empty when there are no more unique coordinates left to process.
- When `next_childs` also becomes empty, it indicates that no further search is required, and the function has either found a path or determined that no path exists between `coord1` and `coord2`.

If the loop does not execute at all, it means that `childs` is initially empty or all elements in `childs` lead to no further useful coordinates. In this case, `cur_depth` remains the same, and `used_coords` includes only the original coordinates and those from `next_childs` that were not processed.
