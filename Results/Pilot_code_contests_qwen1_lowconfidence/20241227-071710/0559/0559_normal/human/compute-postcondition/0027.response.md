The code `childs = list(set(next_childs))` removes duplicates from the `next_childs` list and assigns the result to `childs`. Since `next_childs` is initially an empty list, `set(next_childs)` will also be an empty set, and converting an empty set to a list will still yield an empty list. Therefore, `childs` will be updated to an empty list, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1`, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is an empty list, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`.**
