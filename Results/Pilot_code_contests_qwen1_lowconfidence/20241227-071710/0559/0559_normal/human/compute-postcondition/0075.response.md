Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two coordinates (`coord1` and `coord2`), a dictionary mapping coordinates to their depths (`depth_dict_org`), and a graph representing the maze structure (`graph`). It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from `coord1` to `coord2`. If such a path exists, it returns the minimum depth required to reach `coord2` from `coord1`, incremented by 1. If no path is found, it returns 0.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `coord1` and `coord2` are the same, the function should immediately return 0 since no movement is needed.
- The function does not handle the case where `coord1` or `coord2` do not exist in the `graph`.
- The function assumes that `depth_dict_org` contains valid depth information for all coordinates in the graph. If this is not true, the function might return incorrect results.
- The function does not account for cycles in the graph, which could lead to infinite loops if not properly handled.
- The function does not provide any error messages or exceptions if the input is invalid (e.g., if `coord1` or `coord2` are not tuples or contain non-integer values).
