According to the provided code snippet and the current state, the loop will continue to execute if there are still elements in the `childs` list. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `total` is the same as given.
- `i` is the same as given.
- `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1.
- `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates.
- `next_childs` is an updated list containing its original elements plus the elements of `res`.
- `childs` must contain at least one element.
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate.
- `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze.
- `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze.
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`.
- `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`.
- `res` is not equal to 'found'.
- `used_coords` is unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `childs` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `childs` is reduced but still contains at least one element.

State: **`total` is the same as given, `i` is the same as given, `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an updated list containing its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `res` is not equal to 'found', `used_coords` is unchanged, and `child` is the first element of `childs`**.
