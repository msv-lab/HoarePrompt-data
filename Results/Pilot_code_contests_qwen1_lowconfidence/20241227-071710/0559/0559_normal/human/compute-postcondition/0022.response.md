`res` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. The values of `cur_depth` and `next_childs` are not affected, and `childs` must have at least one more element. Therefore, the output state is: `cur_depth` is the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration, `next_childs` is updated to include `next_childs + res`, and `childs` must have at least one more element; `res` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.
