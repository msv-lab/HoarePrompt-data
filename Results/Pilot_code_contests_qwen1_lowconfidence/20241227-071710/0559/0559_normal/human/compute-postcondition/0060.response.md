Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1.
   - `used_coords` includes all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `childs`.
   - `next_childs` includes all previous elements plus elements from `res`.
   - `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`.
   - `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate.
   - `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze.
   - `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze.
   - `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`.
   - `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`.
   - `childs` contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`.
   - `res` is not equal to 'found'.
   - `next_childs` includes elements from `res`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for child in childs:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `childs`.
   - Each iteration of the loop will process a single element from `childs`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - After the first iteration, `child` will be the first element in `childs`.
   - Since `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, and we are starting a new iteration, the condition for `childs` remains the same.
   - `next_childs` will include the processed `child` in its next iteration, as it comes from `res`.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `cur_depth` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `used_coords` will include the newly processed `child`.
   - `next_childs` will include the current `child` from `res`.
   - `res` may or may not change depending on the loop body, but it will not be equal to 'found' unless the loop body finds the target.
   - `next_childs` will include the current `child` from `res`.

Given this analysis, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` includes all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `child`, `next_childs` includes all previous elements plus the current `child` from `res`, `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `childs` contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `res` is not equal to 'found', `next_childs` includes the current `child` from `res`**
