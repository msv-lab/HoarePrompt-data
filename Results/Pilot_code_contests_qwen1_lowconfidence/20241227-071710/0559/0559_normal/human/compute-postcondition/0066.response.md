The code `res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` assigns the return value of the function `func_2` to the variable `res`. The function `func_2` takes three arguments: `child`, `coord2`, and `used_coords`. The previous value of `res` is only updated if it was `'found'` in the previous iteration.

Let's analyze the impact:

- `cur_depth` remains the same.
- `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`.
- `next_childs` includes the current `child` and the updated value of `res` if `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration.
- `res` retains its previous value unless it was `'found'` in the previous iteration, in which case it is updated to `cur_depth + 1`.

If `res` was not `'found'` in the previous iteration, the value of `res` remains unchanged. If `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration, the value of `res` is updated to `cur_depth + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`, `next_childs` includes the current `child` and the updated value of `res` if `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration, `res` is either its previous value (if not `'found'`) or `cur_depth + 1` (if `'found'`).**
