The code appends the value of `child` to the list `childs`. Since `child` is checked against `target` earlier and depending on the condition, either 'found' is returned or None is returned, this return statement does not affect the current execution path. Therefore, the value of `child` is added to the `childs` list.

Output State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the `graph` dictionary, `child` equals `target` results in 'found' being returned or None, `childs` contains the value of `child`.**
