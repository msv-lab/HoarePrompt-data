Let's break down the task step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Its Initial Value**: The loop iterates over each `child` in `childs`. For the loop to start executing, `childs` must contain at least one element (a unique coordinate).

2. **Check the Given States**:
   - `cur_depth`: This is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1. This variable itself doesn't affect the loop execution but indicates the starting depth.
   - `used_coords`: Includes all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `childs`. This is already given as including all relevant coordinates.
   - `next_childs`: Is unchanged and not directly involved in the current loop.
   - `childs`: Must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs` to ensure the loop can start executing.
   - `graph`: A dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate. This is not directly involved in the loop execution.
   - `coord1`: Coordinates of a road square in the maze, not directly involved in the loop.
   - `coord2`: Coordinates of another road square in the maze, not directly involved in the loop.
   - `depth_dict`: A copy of `depth_dict_org`, not directly involved in the loop.
   - `end_coord`: Equal to `coord2`, not directly involved in the loop.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - The loop can only execute if `childs` contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `childs` to ensure it contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` includes all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `childs`, `next_childs` is unchanged, `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `childs` contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`**
