`used_coords` is updated by adding the contents of `childs` to it. The initial value of `used_coords` includes `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, and `childs` contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`. After adding `childs` to `used_coords`, the updated `used_coords` will include all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `childs`.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` includes all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `childs`, `next_childs` is unchanged, `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`**.
