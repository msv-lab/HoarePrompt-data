Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun` (an integer representing a coordinate in the maze), `target` (an integer representing the goal coordinate), and `used_coords` (a set of integers representing coordinates that have already been visited). It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the neighboring coordinates of `jibun` that have not been visited yet. If the `target` coordinate is found during the exploration, it returns the string `'found'`. If the `target` is not found, it returns a list of all explored coordinates starting from `jibun` that do not match `target`.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- If `jibun` is not present in the `graph` dictionary, the function will raise a `KeyError`.
- If `target` is the `jibun` itself, the function will immediately return `'found'` without exploring any neighbors.
- If `graph[jibun]` is an empty list, the function will still check its neighbors but will not find any unvisited coordinates, thus returning an empty list.

**Missing functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where the `target` is not reachable from `jibun` within the given graph structure. In such a scenario, the function would explore all reachable coordinates and still return an empty list. However, it does not explicitly inform the caller about the non-reachability of the `target`.
