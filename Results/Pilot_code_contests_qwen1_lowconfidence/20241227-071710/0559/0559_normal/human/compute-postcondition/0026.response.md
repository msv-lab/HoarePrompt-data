Output State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1`, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is the list of directly reachable road squares from `coord1`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop continues searching through the maze until it finds a path from `coord1` to `coord2` or exhausts all possible paths.
- If a path is found, `func_2` returns `'found'` and the function returns `cur_depth + 1`.
- If no path is found, the loop will eventually terminate without finding a path, and the function will return `None` (or a similar indication that no path was found).
- During each iteration, `cur_depth` is incremented and the `next_childs` list is updated with the results of the recursive calls.
- `used_coords` keeps track of all the coordinates visited during the search.
- `next_childs` becomes empty once the search is complete since there are no more children to explore.
- The variables `coord1`, `coord2`, `depth_dict_org`, `graph`, and `end_coord` retain their initial values unless modified by the function or loop, which they do not based on the provided code snippet.
