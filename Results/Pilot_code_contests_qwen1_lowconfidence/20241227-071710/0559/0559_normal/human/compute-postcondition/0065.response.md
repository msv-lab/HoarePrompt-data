Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `cur_depth` remains the same.
   - `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`.
   - `next_childs` includes the current `child` from `res` and the updated value of `res` if `res == 'found'`.
   - `res` is updated to `cur_depth + 1` if `res == 'found'`, or retains its previous value otherwise.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `childs`.

3. **Effect of Loop Iteration:**
   - Each iteration processes a `child`.
   - `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`.
   - Depending on the value of `res`:
     - If `res == 'found'`, `next_childs` includes the current `child` and the updated value of `res` (which would be `cur_depth + 1`).
     - Otherwise, `next_childs` includes the current `child` and retains the previous value of `res`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since each iteration processes a `child` and updates `used_coords` accordingly, we need to ensure that `next_childs` is correctly set for the next iteration.
   - `cur_depth` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop condition.
   - `used_coords` should include the newly processed `child` from the next iteration.
   - `next_childs` should include the current `child` and the updated `res` if `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration.

5. **Final State Calculation:**
   - `cur_depth` remains the same.
   - `used_coords` should include the newly processed `child` from the next iteration.
   - `next_childs` should include the current `child` and the updated `res` if `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration.
   - `res` retains its previous value unless it was `'found'` in the previous iteration, in which case it is updated to `cur_depth + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child` from the next iteration, `next_childs` includes the current `child` and the updated value of `res` if `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration, `res` retains its previous value unless it was `'found'` in the previous iteration, in which case it is updated to `cur_depth + 1`**. 

However, for clarity and consistency, let's reformat it as requested:

State: **`cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`, `next_childs` includes the current `child` and the updated value of `res` if `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration, `res` retains its previous value unless it was `'found'` in the previous iteration, in which case it is updated to `cur_depth + 1`**.
