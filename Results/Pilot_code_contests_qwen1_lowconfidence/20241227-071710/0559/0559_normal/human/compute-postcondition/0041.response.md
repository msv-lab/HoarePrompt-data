Postcondition: ***`total` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` remains unchanged, `next_childs` contains its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `graph` remains unchanged, `coord1` remains the same, `coord2` remains the same, `depth_dict` remains a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, and the program returns `cur_depth + 1` if `res == 'found'`. Otherwise, no change in the program state.***
