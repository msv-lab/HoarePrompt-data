Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over each `child` in the `childs` list. For the loop to execute, `childs` must contain at least one element.

2. **Current States**:
   - `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1.
   - `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates.
   - `next_childs` is an empty list.
   - `childs` is empty.
   - `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate.
   - `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze.
   - `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze.
   - `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`.
   - `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`.
   - `used_coords` is unchanged.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute, `childs` must contain at least one element. Since `next_childs` and `childs` are both currently empty, we need to adjust the state to include at least one child in `childs`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to add at least one element to `childs` for the loop to execute. Since `next_childs` is also empty, we might consider adding elements to either `next_childs` or `childs` to ensure the loop can proceed.

Based on the above reasoning, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`total` is the same as given (if applicable), `i` is the same as given (if applicable), `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` must contain at least one element, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `used_coords` is unchanged**.

However, since the task specifies adjusting the state to allow the loop to execute, the critical adjustment is:

State: **`total` is the same as given (if applicable), `i` is the same as given (if applicable), `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` must contain at least one element, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `used_coords` is unchanged**.
