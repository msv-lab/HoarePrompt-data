The code initializes an empty list named `childs`. This means that no new elements are added to the list, and its initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`jibun` is an integer representing a coordinate in the maze, `target` is a coordinate (also an integer) that represents the goal coordinate, `used_coords` is a set of coordinates (integers) that have already been visited, and `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates (integers) and values are lists of adjacent road coordinates (integers); `childs` is an empty list.**
