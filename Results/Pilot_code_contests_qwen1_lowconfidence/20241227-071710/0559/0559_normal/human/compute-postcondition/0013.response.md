Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `jibun` is a valid coordinate in the `graph` dictionary.
   - `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element.
   - If `child` is not in `used_coords`, then `used_coords` is updated to include `child`.
   - The function does not return anything if `child` is already in `used_coords`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each `child` in `graph[jibun]`.

3. **What Needs to Happen for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be another valid `child` in `graph[jibun]` that is not yet in `used_coords`.
   - If `graph[jibun]` is exhausted (i.e., it no longer contains any elements), the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `jibun` is still a valid coordinate in `graph`, it remains the same.
   - `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue. However, since we are moving to the next iteration, we assume that the current `child` was either not added to `used_coords` or is the first iteration where we check the next `child`.
   - `used_coords` must not include the current `child` for the loop to continue. If `child` is in `used_coords`, the loop would have terminated, so it must not be there.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `jibun` remains a valid coordinate in the `graph` dictionary.
   - `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element (the next `child` to be processed).
   - `used_coords` must not include the current `child`.

Therefore, the state for the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element, and `used_coords` does not include the current `child`**.
