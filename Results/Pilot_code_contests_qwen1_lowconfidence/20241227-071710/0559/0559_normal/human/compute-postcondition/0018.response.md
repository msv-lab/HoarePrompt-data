Output State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[jibun]` is an empty list, `childs` contains all the coordinates that were explored starting from `jibun` and none of them match `target`, and `used_coords` contains all the coordinates that were visited during the exploration.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to iterate as long as there are unvisited neighbors of `jibun` in the `graph`.
- If `graph[jibun]` becomes empty, the loop will stop without finding `target`.
- If `target` is found, the function will return `'found'` and terminate, so the loop will not continue.
- Each time a neighbor (`child`) is explored, it is appended to `childs` and added to `used_coords` if it is not already in `used_coords`.
- If the loop finishes without finding `target`, it means all reachable coordinates from `jibun` have been explored, and none of them match `target`.

Given these points, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `jibun` remains a valid coordinate in the `graph` dictionary.
- `graph[jibun]` becomes an empty list because all its neighbors have been explored.
- `childs` contains all the coordinates that were explored starting from `jibun` and none of them match `target`.
- `used_coords` contains all the coordinates that were visited during the exploration.
