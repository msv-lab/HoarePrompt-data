The code `cur_depth += 1` increments the value of `cur_depth` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `cur_depth` is one more than its previous value. 

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is not empty (contains at least one element), `childs` is empty, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`**
