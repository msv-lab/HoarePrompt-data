`res` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. The function call depends on the values of `child`, `coord2`, and `used_coords`, but their exact values are not specified. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` remains unchanged, `next_childs` contains its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` must contain at least two elements, `graph` remains unchanged, `coord1` remains the same, `coord2` remains the same, `depth_dict` remains a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, and `res` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.

Output State: **`total` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` remains unchanged, `next_childs` contains its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` must contain at least two elements, `graph` remains unchanged, `coord1` remains the same, `coord2` remains the same, `depth_dict` remains a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `res` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
