The code `next_childs += res` appends the value of `res` to the list `next_childs`. Since `res` is not defined as being equal to a specific value before this line of code, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `next_childs` is initially a list, and now it will contain its original elements plus the elements of `res`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is the same as given, `i` is the same as given, `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an updated list containing its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `res` is not equal to 'found', `used_coords` is unchanged.**
