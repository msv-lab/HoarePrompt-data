According to the code, the loop will iterate over each child coordinate in the adjacency list of the current `jibun` coordinate. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. The key `jibun` must exist in the `graph` dictionary, meaning there must be at least one coordinate in the maze that is connected to `jibun`.
2. The `graph` dictionary must have an entry for `jibun` that contains at least one element (i.e., at least one child coordinate).

Let's break this down step by step:

- **`jibun`**: This variable represents the starting coordinate in the maze. For the loop to execute, `jibun` must be a valid coordinate that exists in the `graph` dictionary.
- **`graph[jibun]`**: This should contain at least one element, meaning `jibun` must have at least one adjacent coordinate in the maze.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state such that `jibun` is a valid coordinate and `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element.

Here is the modified state:

State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate that exists in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element**
