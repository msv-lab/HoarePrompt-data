The code snippet `next_childs += res` appends the elements of `res` to `next_childs`. Since `res` is not defined as a list or iterable in the given initial state, we cannot determine its exact contents. However, we know that `next_childs` is a list (or can be treated as such for this operation), and `res` is being added to it.

Given the initial state, the only direct impact is that `next_childs` will now include all elements of `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` includes all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `childs`, `next_childs` includes all previous elements plus elements from `res`, `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `childs` contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `res` is not equal to 'found', `next_childs` includes elements from `res`**
