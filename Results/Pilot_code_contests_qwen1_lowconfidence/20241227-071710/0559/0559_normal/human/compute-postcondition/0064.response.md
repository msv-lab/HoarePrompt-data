`next_childs` is assigned the value of `next_childs + res`. Since `res` can either be `'found'` or retain its previous value, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `res == 'found'`, then `res` is updated to `cur_depth + 1`.
2. Otherwise, `res` retains its previous value.

In either case, `next_childs` will include the current `child` from `res`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `cur_depth` remains the same.
- `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`.
- `next_childs` includes the current `child` from `res` and also includes the updated value of `res` if `res == 'found'`.
- `res` is updated to `cur_depth + 1` if `res == 'found'`, or retains its previous value otherwise.

Output State: **`cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`, `next_childs` includes the current `child` from `res` and the updated value of `res` if `res == 'found'`, `res` is updated to `cur_depth + 1` if `res == 'found'`, or retains its previous value otherwise**.
