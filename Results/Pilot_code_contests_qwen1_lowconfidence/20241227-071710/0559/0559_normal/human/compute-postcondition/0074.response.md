The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `coord1` and `coord2`. Both `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing the coordinates (row, column) of two road squares in the maze. Additionally, the function takes `depth_dict_org`, which is a dictionary mapping coordinates to their depths, and `graph`, which is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate.

Based on the output cases provided, the function seems to be related to finding the shortest path in terms of depth from `coord1` to `coord2` in a maze-like structure. The function may return different values depending on the current depth (`cur_depth`) and the conditions under which the function is executed.

Given the output cases, the most fitting description would be:

Case_1: The program returns 2.
Case_2: The program returns `cur_depth` that has been incremented by 1.
Case_3: The program returns `cur_depth` plus 1, where `cur_depth` is the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration.
Case_4: The program returns `cur_depth` + 1, where `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1.
Case_5: The program returns `cur_depth` + 1 where `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1.
Case_6: The program returns `cur_depth` + 1 where `cur_depth` is the current depth and remains the same as before.
Case_7: The program returns `cur_depth` + 1, where `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1.
Case_8: The program returns `cur_depth` plus 1.
Case_9: The program returns `cur_depth` + 1 where `cur_depth` is the current depth value and +1 indicates the increment in depth by processing the child.
Case_10: The program returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept `coord1`, `coord2`, `depth_dict_org`, and `graph`, and based on the current depth (`cur_depth`) and specific conditions, return either a fixed value (like 2 or 0), the incremented depth, or the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` incremented by 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts `coord1`, `coord2`, `depth_dict_org`, and `graph`. It returns 2, 0, or an incremented depth value (`cur_depth` + 1) based on the specific conditions provided.**
