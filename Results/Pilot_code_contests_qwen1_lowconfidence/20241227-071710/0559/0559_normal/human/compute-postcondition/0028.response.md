Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- **`cur_depth`**: The minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1`.
- **`used_coords`**: A list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates.
- **`next_childs`**: An empty list.
- **`childs`**: An empty list.
- **`graph`**: A dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate.
- **`coord1`**: A tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze.
- **`coord2`**: A tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze.
- **`depth_dict`**: A copy of `depth_dict_org`.
- **`end_coord`**: Equal to `coord2`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while len(childs) != 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop condition checks whether the length of the `childs` list is not zero. For the loop to execute one more time, `len(childs)` must be non-zero.

Given that `childs` is initially empty (`[]`), we need to adjust the state such that `len(childs)` becomes non-zero before the next iteration of the loop.

### States to Adjust:
- Since `next_childs` is initially empty and no operations are specified to populate `next_childs` or `childs` within the loop body, the only way to make `len(childs)` non-zero is to ensure that there are elements added to `childs` before the loop ends.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `next_childs` is populated with some elements before the loop ends. This typically happens through some exploration or search process within the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the state, we assume that this addition has occurred and that `next_childs` now contains at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1`, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is not empty (contains at least one element), `childs` is empty, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`**.
