The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. 

- `jibun` is an integer representing a coordinate in the maze.
- `target` is an integer that represents the goal coordinate.
- `used_coords` is a set of coordinates (integers) that have already been visited.

The function can return one of the following:

- 'found'
- A list 'childs' containing all the coordinates that were explored starting from 'jibun' and none of them match 'target'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `jibun`, an integer `target`, and a set `used_coords`, and if it finds the target, it returns 'found'. If it explores all possible coordinates starting from `jibun` without finding the target, it returns a list of all explored coordinates.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `jibun` (an integer), `target` (an integer), and `used_coords` (a set of integers). It returns 'found' if the target is found during exploration. Otherwise, it returns a list 'childs' containing all explored coordinates starting from `jibun` and none of them matching `target`.**
