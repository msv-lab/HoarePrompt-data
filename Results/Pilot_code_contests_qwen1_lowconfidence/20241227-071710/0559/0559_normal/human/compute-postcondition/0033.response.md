The code `res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` assigns the return value of the function `func_2` to the variable `res`. Since the function `func_2` is not defined here, we cannot determine its exact behavior or return value. However, we know that the function is called with `child` as the first argument, `coord2` as the second argument, and `used_coords` as the third argument.

The output state will include the updated value of `res` and the unchanged values of other variables. 

Output State: **`total` is the same as given, `i` is the same as given, `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` must contain at least one element, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, `used_coords` is unchanged**
