According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `jibun`, `graph`, and `child`. The loop iterates over each `child` in `graph[jibun]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `jibun` is a valid coordinate that exists in the `graph` dictionary.
- `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element.
- `child` is not equal to `target`.
- After the execution of the if-else block, `child` is either added to `used_coords` (if it was not already in `used_coords`), or the condition `child not in used_coords` does not hold, hence no action is taken.

For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one more element that has not yet been processed. Therefore, `child` needs to be updated to the next element in `graph[jibun]`, and `used_coords` must include the previously processed `child`.

Step-by-step adjustment of states:
1. `jibun` remains the same as it is not being changed within the loop.
2. `graph[jibun]` must still contain at least one element, but the specific `child` to be processed is now the next one in the sequence.
3. `child` needs to be the next element in `graph[jibun]`.
4. `used_coords` must include the previously processed `child`.

State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate that exists in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element, and `child` is the next element in `graph[jibun]`, and `used_coords` includes the previously processed `child`**
