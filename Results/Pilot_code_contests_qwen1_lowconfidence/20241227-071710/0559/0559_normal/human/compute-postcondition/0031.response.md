The code `used_coords += childs` appends all elements in the `childs` list to the `used_coords` list. Given that `childs` is an empty list, appending an empty list to `used_coords` does not change the contents of `used_coords`. Therefore, the value of `used_coords` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is empty, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `used_coords` is unchanged**
