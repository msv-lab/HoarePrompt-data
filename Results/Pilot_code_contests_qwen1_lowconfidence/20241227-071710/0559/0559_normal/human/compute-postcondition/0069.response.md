The code snippet `next_childs += res` means that the value of `res` is being added to the list `next_childs`. 

- If `res` is `'found'`, then the function returns `cur_depth + 1` and the addition to `next_childs` does not occur because the function exits early.
- If `res` is not `'found'`, then the value of `res` (which could be an integer) is appended to the list `next_childs`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `cur_depth` remains the same.
- `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`.
- `next_childs` includes the current `child` and the updated value of `res` if `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration.
- `res` is either its previous value (if not `'found'`) or `cur_depth + 1` (if `'found'`).

Since the code is adding `res` to `next_childs` and we know that `res` is either a previous value or `cur_depth + 1`:

Output State: **`cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`, `next_childs` includes the current `child` and the value of `res`, `res` is either its previous value (if not `'found'`) or `cur_depth + 1` (if `'found'`), `next_childs` is updated by adding the value of `res`**.
