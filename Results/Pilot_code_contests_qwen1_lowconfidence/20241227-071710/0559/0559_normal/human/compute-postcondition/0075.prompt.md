You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing the coordinates (row, column) of two road squares in the maze. depth_dict_org is a dictionary mapping coordinates to their depths, graph is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate.
def func_1(coord1, coord2):
    depth_dict = depth_dict_org.copy()
    cur_coord = coord1
    end_coord = coord2
    cur_depth = 0
    used_coords = [coord1]
    childs = graph[coord1]
    while len(childs) != 0:
        cur_depth += 1
        
        next_childs = []
        
        used_coords += childs
        
        for child in childs:
            res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)
            if res == 'found':
                return cur_depth + 1
            next_childs += res
        
        childs = list(set(next_childs))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1`, `used_coords` is a list of all unique coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` is an empty list, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts `coord1`, `coord2`, `depth_dict_org`, and `graph`. It returns 2, 0, or an incremented depth value (`cur_depth` + 1) based on the specific conditions provided.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `The program returns 2`

Case_2: `The program returns cur_depth that has been incremented by 1`

Case_3: `The program returns cur_depth plus 1, where cur_depth is the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration`

Case_4: The program returns `cur_depth` + 1, where `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1

Case_5: `The program returns cur_depth + 1 where cur_depth is the minimum depth found to reach coord2 from coord1 + 1`

Case_6: `The program returns cur_depth + 1 where cur_depth is the current depth and remains the same as before

Case_7: The program returns `cur_depth` + 1, where `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1

Case_8: `The program returns cur_depth plus 1`

Case_9: `The program returns cur_depth + 1 where cur_depth is the current depth value and +1 indicates the increment in depth by processing the child`

Case_10: The program returns 0


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
