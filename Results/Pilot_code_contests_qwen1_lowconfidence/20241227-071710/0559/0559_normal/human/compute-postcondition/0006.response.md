`child` is appended to the list `childs`. The value of `jibun`, the contents of `graph[jibun]`, and the condition that `child` is not equal to `target` and is not in `used_coords` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `jibun` is a valid coordinate that exists in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element, `child` is not equal to `target`, the current value of `child` is not in `used_coords`, and `childs` is now a list containing at least `child`.

Output State: **`jibun` is a valid coordinate that exists in the `graph` dictionary, `graph[jibun]` contains at least one element, `child` is not equal to `target`, the current value of `child` is not in `used_coords`, and `childs` is a list containing at least `child`**
