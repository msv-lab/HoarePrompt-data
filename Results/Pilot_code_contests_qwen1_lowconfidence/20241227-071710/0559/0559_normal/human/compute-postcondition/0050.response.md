Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the provided program state to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Analysis:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while len(childs) != 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `childs` list.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:

- `cur_depth`: The minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1`.
- `used_coords`: A list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates.
- `next_childs`: A list of coordinates that were checked and their results.
- `childs`: Contains unique coordinates from `next_childs`.
- `graph`: A dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate.
- `coord1`: A tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze.
- `coord2`: A tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze.
- `depth_dict`: A copy of `depth_dict_org`.
- `end_coord`: Equal to `coord2`.
- `used_coords` is unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Condition Check**: The loop continues as long as `len(childs)` is not zero.
2. **Loop Body Execution**: During each iteration, some operations are performed, but the specific details of the loop body are omitted. After each iteration, `childs` might change (coordinates might be added or removed based on the operations inside the loop).
3. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `len(childs)` must be non-zero after the current iteration.

Since the only condition for the loop to continue is that `len(childs)` is not zero, we need to ensure that `len(childs)` is non-zero after the current iteration.

### Adjustment Needed:

To ensure that the loop executes one more time, we need to guarantee that `len(childs)` is non-zero after the current iteration. This can be achieved by ensuring that the loop body adds at least one element to `childs`.

Given that the exact operations inside the loop body are not specified, we assume that the loop body modifies `childs` in such a way that it either adds new elements or removes elements based on certain conditions. However, without knowing the exact behavior, the most straightforward adjustment is to ensure that `len(childs)` is non-zero.

### Final State:

State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1`, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is a list of coordinates that were checked and their results, `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `used_coords` is unchanged.**

This ensures that `len(childs)` is non-zero, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
