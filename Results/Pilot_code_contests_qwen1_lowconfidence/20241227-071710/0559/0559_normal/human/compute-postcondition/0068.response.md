Postcondition: ***`cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` includes the newly processed `child`, `next_childs` includes the current `child` and the updated value of `res` if `res` was `'found'` in the previous iteration, `res` is either its previous value (if not `'found'`) or `cur_depth + 1` (if `'found'`). If `res` equals `'found'`, the function returns `cur_depth + 1`. Otherwise, the function continues with the original `res` value.***
