The function `func_2` is called with parameters `child` (which is an element from `childs`), `coord2`, and `used_coords`. However, the specific return value of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `res`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given the initial conditions:

- `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1
- `used_coords` includes all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `childs`
- `next_childs` is unchanged
- `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate
- `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze
- `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`
- `childs` contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`

After the code `res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is executed, `res` will hold the return value of the function `func_2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` includes all the original coordinates plus the new coordinates from `childs`, `next_childs` is unchanged, `childs` must contain at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `childs` contains at least one unique coordinate from `next_childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`.**
