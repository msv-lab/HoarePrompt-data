The code `childs = list(set(next_childs))` converts `next_childs` into a set to remove duplicates and then back into a list. This means that `next_childs` is converted to a set first, removing any duplicate coordinates, and then converted back to a list.

Given the initial state:
- `cur_depth` remains the same
- `used_coords` includes all unique coordinates visited during the search
- `next_childs` becomes an empty list if no further search is required (though it might contain elements before this operation)
- `childs` is an empty list if no further search is required (though it might contain elements before this operation)
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate
- `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze
- `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`

After executing the code:
- `next_childs` is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list, which becomes `childs`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `cur_depth` remains the same
- `used_coords` includes all unique coordinates visited during the search
- `next_childs` becomes an empty list if no further search is required
- `childs` is updated to be a list of unique coordinates from `next_childs`
- `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate
- `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze
- `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze
- `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`

Output State: **`cur_depth` remains the same, `used_coords` includes all unique coordinates visited during the search, `next_childs` becomes an empty list if no further search is required, `childs` is updated to be a list of unique coordinates from `next_childs`, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`.**
