The code assigns the result of the function call `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` to the variable `res`. Since `child` is the first element of `childs`, and `coord2` is already defined, the function `func_2` is called with `child` as the first argument, `coord2` as the second argument, and `used_coords` as the third argument. The value of `res` is determined by the function, but since the function itself is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `res` will take the value returned by `func_2`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is the same as given, `i` is the same as given, `cur_depth` is the minimum depth found to reach `coord2` from `coord1` + 1, `used_coords` is a list of all coordinates visited during the search, including `coord1` and all reachable coordinates, `next_childs` is an updated list containing its original elements plus the elements of `res`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are coordinates of road squares and values are lists of coordinates of directly reachable road squares from the key coordinate, `coord1` is a tuple representing the coordinates of a road square in the maze, `coord2` is a tuple representing the coordinates of another road square in the maze, `depth_dict` is a copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is equal to `coord2`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, and `used_coords` is unchanged.
