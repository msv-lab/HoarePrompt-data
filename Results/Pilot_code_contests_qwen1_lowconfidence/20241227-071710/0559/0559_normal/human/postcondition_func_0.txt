The function `func_1` accepts two coordinates (`coord1` and `coord2`), a dictionary mapping coordinates to their depths (`depth_dict_org`), and a graph representing the maze structure (`graph`). It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from `coord1` to `coord2`. If such a path exists, it returns the minimum depth required to reach `coord2` from `coord1`, incremented by 1. If no path is found, it returns 0.
