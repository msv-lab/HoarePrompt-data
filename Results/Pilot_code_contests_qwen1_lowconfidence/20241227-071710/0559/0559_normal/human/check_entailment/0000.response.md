Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires finding the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make to travel from a starting road square to a goal road square in the maze. However, the provided code appears to be attempting to implement some form of depth-first search or breadth-first search, but it is not correctly structured to achieve the desired outcome.

The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to handle the problem as described. Specifically:

- `func_1` and `func_2` involve searching for paths, but they do not account for the requirement to find the maximum possible number of moves between any two road squares.
- There is no clear definition of the graph representation (`graph`) or the initial setup that would allow these functions to work correctly for the given problem.
- The program does not read the input maze grid (`H`, `W`, and the grid itself), nor does it process the maze to find the maximum distance between any two road squares.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
