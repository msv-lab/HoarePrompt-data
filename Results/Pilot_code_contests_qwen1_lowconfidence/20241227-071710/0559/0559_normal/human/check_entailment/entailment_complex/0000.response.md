Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided code seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the input to get the dimensions of the maze (`H` and `W`) and constructs the maze grid (`meiro`), as well as a list of all road squares (`coords`).

2. **Graph Construction**: The code constructs a graph (`graph`) where each road square is a node, and edges connect nodes that are adjacent road squares. This is done correctly based on the problem description.

3. **Finding Maximum Path Length**: The main loop iterates over all pairs of road squares and uses the `func_1` function to find the shortest path between them. If such a path exists, it calculates the depth and updates the maximum path length accordingly.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: 
   - `func_1` performs a BFS to find the shortest path between two road squares.
   - `func_2` performs a DFS to explore the neighbors of a given road square, ensuring that no coordinate is revisited.

Given these observations, the code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here are a few additional checks to ensure completeness:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the maze has only one road square, the code would correctly report the maximum path length as 0 because there are no other road squares to reach.
  - If the maze has multiple disconnected components (i.e., isolated road squares), the code would correctly calculate the maximum path length between any pair of road squares within the same component.

- **Graph Connectivity**: The problem constraints ensure that any road square can be reached from any other road square, so the graph is guaranteed to be connected.

- **BFS and DFS Implementation**: The BFS in `func_1` and DFS in `func_2` handle all possible paths correctly without revisiting nodes, which ensures the shortest path is found.

Since the code handles all the described cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately, the correctness of the code is **True**.
