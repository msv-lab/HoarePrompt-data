Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the entire maze grid effectively. They seem to attempt to find a path from one coordinate to another, but they do not explore all possible paths to find the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make. Instead, they appear to be part of a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, but the implementation is incomplete and does not account for all possible road squares or ensure that the maximum distance is calculated.

To properly solve the problem, the program needs to:

1. Parse the maze grid correctly.
2. Represent the grid in a suitable data structure (e.g., adjacency list).
3. Use BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm to find the longest path between any two road squares.

Since the provided code does not fulfill these requirements, it is incorrect.
