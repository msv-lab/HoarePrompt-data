Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make. Specifically, the function `func_1` uses a BFS approach but does not consider the entire graph structure properly. It attempts to find the shortest path between two coordinates, which is not what is required. Instead, it should find the longest path in the graph.

The function `func_1` performs a BFS from `coord1` to `coord2` and returns the depth of the shortest path, which is not useful for finding the maximum possible number of moves. Additionally, the function `func_2` is used within `func_1` but it is designed for DFS and returns a list of unvisited neighbors, which is not necessary for finding the maximum path length.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a different approach, such as finding the diameter of the graph, which represents the longest path between any two nodes. This involves performing BFS twice to find the farthest node from an arbitrary starting node and then finding the farthest node from that farthest node. This will give us the maximum distance between any two nodes in the graph, which is the desired output.

Here is a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. Perform BFS to find the farthest node from an arbitrary starting node.
2. Use the farthest node from step 1 as the new starting point and perform BFS again to find the farthest node.
3. The distance between these two farthest nodes will be the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
