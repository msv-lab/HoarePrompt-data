Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the solution for finding the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to find the shortest path between two coordinates using BFS and DFS, but the main program logic incorrectly uses these functions to calculate the maximum possible moves.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect BFS Implementation in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` performs a BFS to find the shortest path from `coord1` to `coord2`. However, it is designed to return the depth of the path plus one, which is not necessary for the problem's requirement. The problem asks for the maximum possible number of moves, not the shortest path.
   
2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` in Main Program:**
   - In the main program, the variable `max_depth` is updated by calling `func_1` for all pairs of coordinates. This approach is inefficient and incorrect because it finds the shortest paths rather than the maximum possible moves.

### Example of a Counterexample:
Consider a simple 2x2 maze with the following configuration:
```
..
.#
```

- The road squares are `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)`.
- The shortest path between these two points is 1 move (diagonal movement is not allowed).
- However, the maximum possible number of moves to go from one road square to another would be 3 (going around the wall).

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number of moves. It instead calculates the shortest paths, which is not what the problem requires. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
