The code changes the values of `r[x]` to `0` and `c[y]` to `0`. The values of `n`, `m`, `ban`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `ban` is a list of `m` integers.
- `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at index `x` and all other elements still `1`.
- `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at index `y` and all other elements still `1`.
- `ans` is `0`.

After executing the code:

- `r[x]` is now `0`.
- `c[y]` is now `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive); `m` must be greater than 1; `ban` is a list of `m` integers; `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at index `x` and all other elements still `1`; `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at index `y` and all other elements still `1`; `ans` is `0`; `r[x]` is `0`; `c[y]` is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive); `m` must be greater than 1; `ban` is a list of `m` integers; `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at index `x` and all other elements still `1`; `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at index `y` and all other elements still `1`; `ans` is `0`; `r[x]` is `0`; `c[y]` is `0`.**
