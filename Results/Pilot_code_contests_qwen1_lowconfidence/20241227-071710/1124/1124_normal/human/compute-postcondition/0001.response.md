`n` and `m` are integers with the specified ranges. The code `n, m = rints()` attempts to read two integers from the input and assign them to `n` and `m`. However, since `rints()` is not a standard function in Python, we assume it is a custom function that reads two integers separated by whitespace. After executing this line, `n` and `m` will be assigned the values of these two integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 0 and 105 (inclusive)**
