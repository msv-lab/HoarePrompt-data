Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive); `m` is less than or equal to the number of updates made to `r` and `c` through the loop; `ban` is a list of `m` integers; `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `x` in `ban` and all other elements still `1`; `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `y` in `ban` and all other elements still `1`; `ans` is `0`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Variables `n` and `m`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop because the loop only modifies the lists `r` and `c` based on the values in `ban`.
   - `m` is initially an integer between 0 and 105. After each iteration of the loop, `m` decreases by 1 since each call to the loop removes one element from `ban`.

2. **List `ban`:**
   - `ban` is a list of pairs `(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are indices that get updated in the lists `r` and `c` respectively.
   - Since the loop runs `m` times, `ban` must contain exactly `m` pairs.

3. **Lists `r` and `c`:**
   - `r` and `c` are initialized as lists of length `n + 1`, all elements set to `1`.
   - For each pair `(x, y)` in `ban`, the corresponding elements `r[x]` and `c[y]` are set to `0`.
   - After `m` iterations, `r` and `c` will have `0` at the positions specified by `x` and `y` from `ban`.

4. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is initially set to `0` and is not modified within the loop.

By following the loop code and the constraints given, we can deduce the final state of the variables after the loop completes its iterations.
