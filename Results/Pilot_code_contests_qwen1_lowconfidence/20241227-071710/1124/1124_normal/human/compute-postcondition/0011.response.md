Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `m` is less than or equal to the number of updates made to `r` and `c` through the loop, `ban` is a list of `m` integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `x` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `y` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`, `ans` is `ans + sum([r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1]])`**
