Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State Recap
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `m` is less than or equal to the number of updates made to `r` and `c` through the loop.
- `ban` is a list of `m` integers.
- `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `x` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`.
- `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `y` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`.
- `ans` is `0`.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(2, 2 + (n - 2) // 2):
    ans += sum([r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1]])
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `i` from 2 to `(n - 2) // 2`. This means the loop will execute exactly `(n - 2) // 2` times.
2. **What the Loop Does**: For each iteration, the loop adds the sum of four elements from lists `r` and `c` to `ans`. Specifically, it adds `r[i] + r[n - i + 1] + c[i] + c[n - i + 1]`.

### Understanding the Sum
- Each term in the sum `[r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1]]` is either `0` or `1` depending on whether the index `i` (or `n - i + 1`) is in `ban`.
- Therefore, the sum will always be either `0`, `2`, or `4`.

### Final Values of Variables
- **`ans`**: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the sum of all such terms for each valid `i` as described above.
- **`i`**: The final value of `i` will be `(n - 2) // 2`, but this is not a variable we need to explicitly mention in the output state since it's the last value `i` takes.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop only increments `i` and doesn't modify `n`.
- **`m`**: The value of `m` remains unchanged because the loop doesn't affect `m`.
- **`ban`**: The value of `ban` remains unchanged because the loop doesn't modify `ban`.
- **`r` and `c`**: The values of `r` and `c` remain unchanged because the loop doesn't modify them directly. The elements are set to `0` based on `ban`, but these assignments happen outside the loop.

### Output State
Given that the loop will execute exactly `(n - 2) // 2` times, the final value of `ans` will be the sum of the terms `r[i] + r[n - i + 1] + c[i] + c[n - i + 1]` for all valid `i` from 2 to `(n - 2) // 2`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
**Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `r[i] + r[n - i + 1] + c[i] + c[n - i + 1]` for all valid `i` from 2 to `(n - 2) // 2`, `n` must be at least 4, `m` is less than or equal to the number of updates made to `r` and `c` through the loop, `ban` is a list of `m` integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `x` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `y` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`.**
