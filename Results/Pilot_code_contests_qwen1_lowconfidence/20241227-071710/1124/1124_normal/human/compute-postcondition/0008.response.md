The code `r[x], c[y] = 0, 0` assigns the value `0` to both `r[x]` and `c[y]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `ban`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive); `m` must be greater than 1; `ban` must contain at least one pair of integers; `r` and `c` remain as defined; `ans` is `0`; `r[x]` is `0`; `c[y]` is `0`**
