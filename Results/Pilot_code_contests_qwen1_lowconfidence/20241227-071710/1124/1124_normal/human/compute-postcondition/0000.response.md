The provided code snippet defines a lambda function named `rints`. This lambda function reads a line from standard input and splits it into integers, returning them as a list. However, this lambda function does not assign any values to any variables or perform any operations that would alter the existing state. It merely describes how a function would behave if called.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000` and `0 ≤ m ≤ 105`.
- There are `m` lines, each containing two integers `xi` and `yi` such that `1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n`, representing the coordinates of the banned cells. All given cells are distinct.

Since the lambda function does not modify any of these variables or perform any operations, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000` and `0 ≤ m ≤ 105`; there are `m` lines, each containing two integers `xi` and `yi` such that `1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n`, representing the coordinates of the banned cells. All given cells are distinct.**
