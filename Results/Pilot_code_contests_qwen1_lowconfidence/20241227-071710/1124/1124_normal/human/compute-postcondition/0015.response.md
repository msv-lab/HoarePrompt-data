Let's analyze the given code step by step:

- Initial State:
  - `total` is 0
  - `i` is 4
  - `n` must be at least 4
  - `m` is less than or equal to the number of updates made to `r` and `c` through the loop
  - `ban` is a list of `m` integers
  - `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `x` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`
  - `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `y` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`
  - `ans` is `ans + 4`

- Code:
  ```python
  ans += sum([r[i], r[n - i + 1], c[i], c[n - i + 1]])
  ```

  - This line adds the sum of four elements from the lists `r` and `c` to `ans`.
  - Specifically, it calculates `r[4] + r[n - 4 + 1] + c[4] + c[n - 4 + 1]`.

Given that `i` is 4 and `n` must be at least 4:
- `r[i]` is `r[4]`. Since `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements set to `0` at indices specified by `x` in `ban` and `1` otherwise, `r[4]` is `0` if `4` is in `ban` and `1` otherwise.
- `r[n - i + 1]` is `r[n - 4 + 1]` which simplifies to `r[n - 3]`. Similarly, this is `0` if `n - 3` is in `ban` and `1` otherwise.
- `c[i]` is `c[4]`. Since `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements set to `0` at indices specified by `y` in `ban` and `1` otherwise, `c[4]` is `0` if `4` is in `ban` and `1` otherwise.
- `c[n - i + 1]` is `c[n - 4 + 1]` which simplifies to `c[n - 3]`. Similarly, this is `0` if `n - 3` is in `ban` and `1` otherwise.

Therefore, the sum of these four elements is calculated and added to `ans`.

Since the exact values of `r[4]`, `r[n - 3]`, `c[4]`, and `c[n - 3]` depend on whether `4` and `n - 3` are in `ban`, let's denote the sum of these elements as `s` where `s` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the state of `ban`.

- The new value of `ans` is `ans + s` where `s = r[4] + r[n - 3] + c[4] + c[n - 3]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 4, `m` is less than or equal to the number of updates made to `r` and `c` through the loop, `ban` is a list of `m` integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `x` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `y` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`, `ans` is `ans + 4 + s` where `s = r[4] + r[n - 3] + c[4] + c[n - 3]`**
