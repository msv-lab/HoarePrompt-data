Postcondition: ***`ans` is the sum of `r[i] + r[n - i + 1] + c[i] + c[n - i + 1]` for all valid `i` from 2 to `(n - 2) // 2`, plus 1 if the condition `(n % 2 and (r[(n + 1) // 2] or c[(n + 1) // 2]))` holds true. `n` must be at least 4, `m` is less than or equal to the number of updates made to `r` and `c` through the loop, `ban` is a list of `m` integers, `r` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `x` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`, `c` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated to `0` at indices specified by `y` in `ban` and all other elements are `1`.***
