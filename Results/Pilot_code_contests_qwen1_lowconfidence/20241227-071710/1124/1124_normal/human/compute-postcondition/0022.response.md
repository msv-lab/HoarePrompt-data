Functionality: **The function processes an integer \( n \) (the size of the grid) and another integer \( m \) (the number of banned cells). It then takes \( m \) lines of input, each containing two integers \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) representing the coordinates of banned cells on a \( n \times n \) grid. After processing the banned cells, the function calculates the number of paths from the top-left corner (1,1) to the bottom-right corner (n,n) that do not pass through any of the banned cells. This is done by summing up the values of specific grid positions and adding a potential additional path if the grid size \( n \) is odd. The function returns the total count of such paths as an integer.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( n \) is 2, the function will only check the single path from (1,1) to (2,2) and return 0 if both cells are banned, otherwise return 1.
- If \( n \) is odd, the middle cell (grid index \((n+1)/2, (n+1)/2\)) is checked for availability, and if it can be used, an additional path is counted.
- If no cells are banned, the function will count all possible paths, which is \( 2^{(n-1)} \).

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not handle the case where \( n \) is 1, which should return 1 if there are no banned cells and 0 otherwise.
- The code does not validate the input constraints for \( n \) and \( m \) strictly within their specified ranges, although the provided constraints ensure these checks are implicitly met.
