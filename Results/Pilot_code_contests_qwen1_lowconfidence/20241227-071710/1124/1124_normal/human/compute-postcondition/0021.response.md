The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it processes an internal state defined by the constraints and relationships given. Specifically, it considers two integers `n` and `m` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 105. Additionally, it processes `m` lines, each containing two integers `xi` and `yi` such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, representing the coordinates of banned cells. All given cells are distinct.

Based on the provided information, the function likely determines if a certain cell or path is allowed based on the banned cells but does not explicitly return a value in the prompt. Given the structure, we infer the possible return values from the problem context, which are not detailed here.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the integers `n` and `m`, and the subsequent `m` lines of coordinates, and based on this information, determine if certain conditions or paths are allowed (though the exact return value is not specified).

Functionality: **The function processes two integers `n` and `m` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 105, and `m` lines each containing two integers `xi` and `yi` such that 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, representing the coordinates of banned cells. It then determines if certain conditions or paths are allowed based on these inputs.**
