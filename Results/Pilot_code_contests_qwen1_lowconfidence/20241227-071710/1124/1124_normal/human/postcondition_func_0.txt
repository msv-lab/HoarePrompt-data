The function processes an integer \( n \) (the size of the grid) and another integer \( m \) (the number of banned cells). It then takes \( m \) lines of input, each containing two integers \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) representing the coordinates of banned cells on a \( n \times n \) grid. After processing the banned cells, the function calculates the number of paths from the top-left corner (1,1) to the bottom-right corner (n,n) that do not pass through any of the banned cells. This is done by summing up the values of specific grid positions and adding a potential additional path if the grid size \( n \) is odd. The function returns the total count of such paths as an integer.
