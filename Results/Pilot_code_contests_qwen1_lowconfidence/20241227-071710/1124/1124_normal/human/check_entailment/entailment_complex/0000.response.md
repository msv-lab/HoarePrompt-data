Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values \( n \) and \( m \) along with the coordinates of the banned cells, which matches the problem description.

2. **Banned Cell Handling**: The program initializes two lists `r` and `c` to keep track of banned cells on the rows and columns, respectively. For each banned cell, it sets the corresponding index in `r` and `c` to 0. This ensures that banned cells are properly accounted for.

3. **Chip Placement Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the possible positions for chip placement, starting from the second row and column to the second-to-last row and column.
   - It sums the values of the relevant positions in `r` and `c` for each position \( i \), considering both directions (from top to bottom and from left to right).
   - This approach ensures that only valid positions for chip placement are considered, avoiding banned cells and ensuring that chips move to opposite edges without colliding or landing on the same cell.

4. **Handling Odd Grid Sizes**:
   - If the grid size \( n \) is odd, the program checks if the central row and column cells are still available. If they are, it adds 1 to the final count, ensuring that a chip can be placed in the center and moved to the opposite edge.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the maximum points (number of chips that can be placed) based on the described logic.

Since the program follows the steps and logic described in the problem statement accurately and handles all potential valid inputs as required, the program is correct.
