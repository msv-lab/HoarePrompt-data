Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the field size `n` is even and the center cell is not banned but still cannot place a chip in it due to the movement constraints. Specifically, for even `n`, the center row and column do not have opposite boundary cells to move to, so no chip can be placed there. However, the program incorrectly counts the center row and column cells as available for placing chips.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 0
```

The correct output should be `2` because Gerald can place chips in cells `(2, 1)` and `(2, 4)`, or `(1, 2)` and `(4, 2)`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `4`, counting all non-corner cells in the middle row and column as valid, which is not correct.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if the center row and column can be used when `n` is even and adjust the count accordingly.
