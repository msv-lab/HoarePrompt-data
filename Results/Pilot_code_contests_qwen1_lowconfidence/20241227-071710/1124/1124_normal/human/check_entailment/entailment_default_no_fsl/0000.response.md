Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code attempts to calculate the number of possible paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner without passing through banned cells, which is not the correct approach according to the problem description.

The problem requires placing chips on border cells (not corner cells) and moving them such that they do not fall on banned cells, do not occupy the same cell at any time, and do not swap positions mid-move. The code does not address these constraints at all.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
4 3
3 1
3 2
3 3

Output:
1
```
According to the problem description, the correct output should be `0` because it is impossible to place chips on border cells (not corner cells) such that they can move from one side of the board to the other without violating the game rules. However, the code incorrectly outputs `1`.

Additionally, the code does not handle the movement of chips correctly. It simply counts potential paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, which is irrelevant to the actual game mechanics described.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to a verdict of **False**.
