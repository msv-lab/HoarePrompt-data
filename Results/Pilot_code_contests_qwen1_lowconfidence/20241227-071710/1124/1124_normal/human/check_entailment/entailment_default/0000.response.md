Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code aims to count the number of valid paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of an \( n \times n \) grid, avoiding banned cells, which does not align with the game's rules.

The game requires placing chips on border cells (not corner cells) and moving them such that no two chips swap positions or land on banned cells during the \( n-1 \) minute process. The code does not handle this logic at all. Instead, it counts paths, which is not relevant to the game's mechanics.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 1
2 2
```
In this case, the correct output should be `0` because placing a chip on any border cell (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), or (3,2) would result in the chip eventually landing on the banned cell (2,2) at some point during the movement, causing Gerald to lose. However, the provided code does not account for this and would incorrectly output a non-zero value.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
