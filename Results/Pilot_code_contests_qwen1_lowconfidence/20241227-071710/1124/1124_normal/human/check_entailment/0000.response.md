Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple chips can be placed on the same row or column without violating the game rules. Specifically, the program incorrectly sums the available cells in each row and column, leading to an overestimation of the number of chips that can be placed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4 0
```
The correct output should be 2 because we can place one chip on (2, 1) and another on (2, 4), or similarly on (1, 2) and (3, 2). However, the program will incorrectly calculate the maximum points as 4, which is incorrect.

The program needs to ensure that no two chips are placed on the same cell and that no chip falls on a banned cell during its movement. The current logic does not account for these constraints properly, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
