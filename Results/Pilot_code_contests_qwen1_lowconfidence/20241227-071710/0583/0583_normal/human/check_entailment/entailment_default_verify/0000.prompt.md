You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dima and his friends have been playing hide and seek at Dima's place all night. As a result, Dima's place got messy. In the morning they decided that they need to clean the place.

To decide who exactly would clean the apartment, the friends want to play a counting-out game. First, all the guys stand in a circle, and then each of them shows some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), and then the boys count in a circle, starting from Dima, the number of people, respective to the total number of fingers shown. The person on who the countdown stops will clean the apartment.

For example, if Dima and one of his friends played hide and seek, and 7 fingers were shown during the counting-out, then Dima would clean the place. If there were 2 or say, 8 fingers shown, then his friend would clean the place.

Dima knows how many fingers each of his friends will show during the counting-out. Now he is interested in the number of ways to show some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), so that he did not have to clean the place. Help Dima.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of Dima's friends. Dima himself isn't considered to be his own friend. The second line contains n positive integers, not exceeding 5, representing, how many fingers the Dima's friends will show. 

The numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem.

Note

In the first sample Dima can show 1, 3 or 5 fingers. If Dima shows 3 fingers, then the counting-out will go like that: Dima, his friend, Dima, his friend.

In the second sample Dima can show 2 or 4 fingers.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
    print(5 - temp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he does not have to clean the apartment. The logic in the program is flawed because it sums the fingers shown by Dima's friends and then tries to find the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that the total sum modulo \(k\) (where \(k\) is the number of people including Dima) equals zero. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the circular nature of the counting-out process properly.

For example, consider the input:

```
2
3 5
```

According to the problem description, Dima needs to show a number of fingers such that the total number of fingers shown (including Dima's) modulo the number of people (Dima + friends) does not equal zero. The correct solution should check each possible number of fingers Dima can show (1 to 5) and see if it results in a non-zero remainder when the total number of fingers is taken modulo \(k\).

The correct approach would involve iterating over each possible number of fingers Dima can show and checking if the condition \((s + i) \% k \neq 0\) holds true, where \(i\) is the number of fingers Dima shows and \(s\) is the sum of fingers shown by his friends.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):  # Dima can show 1 to 5 fingers
        if (s + i) % k != 0:
            temp += 1
    print(temp)

func()
```

This version correctly counts the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he does not have to clean the apartment.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes an integer `n` representing the number of Dima's friends and a list of `n` integers representing the fingers shown by Dima's friends, where each integer does not exceed 5. It calculates the sum of these integers and then checks if adding any integer from 0 to 4 to this sum results in a value divisible by `n + 1`. If such an integer exists, `temp` is incremented. After the loop, the function prints the number of integers from 0 to 4 that do not satisfy the divisibility condition, which is `5 - temp`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is 1, the value of `k` will be 2, and the loop will check divisibility by 2.
- If the sum `s` plus any integer from 0 to 4 is already divisible by `k`, `temp` will be incremented.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-integer values for `n` or non-integer or out-of-range values in the list).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
