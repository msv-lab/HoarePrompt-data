Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he does not have to clean the apartment. The logic in the program is flawed because it sums the fingers shown by Dima's friends and then tries to find the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that the total sum modulo \(k\) (where \(k\) is the number of people including Dima) equals zero. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the circular nature of the counting-out process properly.

For example, consider the input:

```
2
3 5
```

According to the problem description, Dima needs to show a number of fingers such that the total number of fingers shown (including Dima's) modulo the number of people (Dima + friends) does not equal zero. The correct solution should check each possible number of fingers Dima can show (1 to 5) and see if it results in a non-zero remainder when the total number of fingers is taken modulo \(k\).

The correct approach would involve iterating over each possible number of fingers Dima can show and checking if the condition \((s + i) \% k \neq 0\) holds true, where \(i\) is the number of fingers Dima shows and \(s\) is the sum of fingers shown by his friends.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):  # Dima can show 1 to 5 fingers
        if (s + i) % k != 0:
            temp += 1
    print(temp)

func()
```

This version correctly counts the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he does not have to clean the apartment.
