Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly calculate the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he does not have to clean the apartment. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program checks if the sum of the fingers shown by Dima's friends plus any integer from 0 to 4 is divisible by \( k \) (which is \( n + 1 \)). If such a number exists, `temp` is incremented. However, this approach does not directly address the problem of finding how many different finger counts (from 1 to 5) Dima can show to avoid having to clean the apartment.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that the total number of fingers shown (including Dima's) is not divisible by \( k \). The current implementation checks divisibility by \( k \) but does not account for the possible finger counts (1 to 5) Dima can show to avoid cleaning.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
   - Calculate the sum of the fingers shown by Dima's friends.
   - Check for each possible number of fingers Dima can show (1 to 5) whether the total number of fingers (sum + Dima's fingers) is not divisible by \( k \).
   - Count the number of such valid finger counts.

Given the current logic, the program does not implement the correct solution to the problem. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
