You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Dima and his friends have been playing hide and seek at Dima's place all night. As a result, Dima's place got messy. In the morning they decided that they need to clean the place.

To decide who exactly would clean the apartment, the friends want to play a counting-out game. First, all the guys stand in a circle, and then each of them shows some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), and then the boys count in a circle, starting from Dima, the number of people, respective to the total number of fingers shown. The person on who the countdown stops will clean the apartment.

For example, if Dima and one of his friends played hide and seek, and 7 fingers were shown during the counting-out, then Dima would clean the place. If there were 2 or say, 8 fingers shown, then his friend would clean the place.

Dima knows how many fingers each of his friends will show during the counting-out. Now he is interested in the number of ways to show some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), so that he did not have to clean the place. Help Dima.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of Dima's friends. Dima himself isn't considered to be his own friend. The second line contains n positive integers, not exceeding 5, representing, how many fingers the Dima's friends will show. 

The numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.

Output

In a single line print the answer to the problem.

Output

3

Note

In the first sample Dima can show 1, 3 or 5 fingers. If Dima shows 3 fingers, then the counting-out will go like that: Dima, his friend, Dima, his friend.

In the second sample Dima can show 2 or 4 fingers.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The number of Dima's friends is represented by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) in the input, and the fingers shown by Dima's friends are represented by a list of n integers, each not exceeding 5.
def func():
    n = input()
    s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 5, `s` is the sum of the integers represented by the string `n`, and `temp` is 1 if the condition `(s + i) % k == 0` holds for any `i` in the range [0, 4], otherwise `temp` is 0.
    print(5 - temp)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `n` representing the number of Dima's friends and a list of `n` integers representing the fingers shown by Dima's friends, where each integer does not exceed 5. It calculates the sum of these integers and then checks if adding any integer from 0 to 4 to this sum results in a value divisible by `n + 1`. If such an integer exists, `temp` is incremented. After the loop, the function prints the number of integers from 0 to 4 that do not satisfy the divisibility condition, which is `5 - temp`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is 1, the value of `k` will be 2, and the loop will check divisibility by 2.
- If the sum `s` plus any integer from 0 to 4 is already divisible by `k`, `temp` will be incremented.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-integer values for `n` or non-integer or out-of-range values in the list).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
