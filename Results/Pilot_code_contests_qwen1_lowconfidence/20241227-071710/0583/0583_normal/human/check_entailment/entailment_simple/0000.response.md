Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of friends (`n`) and the number of fingers each friend will show. However, it assumes that the input for the number of fingers is a single string with multiple space-separated integers, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the fingers shown by Dima's friends using `sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))`. This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Logic Error**: The program checks if Dima can show a number of fingers such that the total sum plus the number of fingers Dima shows results in a multiple of the total number of participants (Dima + his friends). This is incorrect because the problem description requires Dima to find out the number of ways he can show fingers such that he is not chosen to clean the apartment.

4. **Output Logic**: The program prints `5 - temp`, which is the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he is not chosen to clean the apartment. This logic is flawed because `temp` should count the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he is chosen to clean the apartment, and then subtract this from 5.

To fix the program, the logic should be:
- Calculate the sum of the fingers shown by Dima's friends.
- Count the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he is chosen to clean the apartment.
- Subtract this count from 5 to get the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he is not chosen to clean the apartment.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = sum(map(int, input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
    
    # Corrected output logic
    print(5 - temp)
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of ways Dima can show fingers such that he is not chosen to clean the apartment and prints the result.
