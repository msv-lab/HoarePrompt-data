Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function aims to determine the number of ways Dima can show a certain number of fingers such that he does not have to clean the apartment. However, the code has a few issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads input using `input()` and `raw_input()`, which are not standard Python functions in modern Python versions (Python 3.x). The correct functions to use are `int(input())` and `list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Logic for Counting Ways**: The logic in the loop is flawed. It checks if `(s + i) % k == 0` for `i` in range(5), which means it checks if the sum of the fingers plus 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 is divisible by `k`. If such a number exists, `temp` is incremented. This does not correctly determine the number of ways Dima can show his fingers such that he does not clean the apartment.

3. **Calculation of `k`**: The value of `k` is calculated as `n + 1`, which is correct. However, the loop logic should be checking if `(s + i) % k != 0` for `i` in range(5), and increment `temp` only if the condition is true. The current implementation increments `temp` whenever the sum is divisible by `k`, which is not what the problem requires.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
