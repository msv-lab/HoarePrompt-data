Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code calculates the number of ways Dima can show his fingers such that he does not have to clean the place. However, the code incorrectly calculates the number of valid finger combinations by simply checking divisibility conditions without considering all possible combinations of Dima's fingers.

For instance, consider the following input:
- Input: 
  ```
  2
  1 2
  ```

According to the problem description, Dima needs to show a number of fingers such that the total sum of fingers shown (including Dima's) is not divisible by the total number of people (Dima + 2 friends). 

The code, however, only checks if the sum of fingers shown by friends plus any number from 0 to 4 is divisible by `n + 1` (which is 3 in this case). This is not sufficient because it does not account for all possible combinations of Dima's fingers.

For example, if Dima shows 1 finger, the total sum would be `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`, which is not divisible by 3. However, the code does not correctly handle this scenario.

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
