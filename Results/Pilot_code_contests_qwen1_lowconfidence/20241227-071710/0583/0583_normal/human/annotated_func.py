#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. The number of Dima's friends is represented by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) in the input, and the fingers shown by Dima's friends are represented by a list of n integers, each not exceeding 5.
def func():
    n = input()
    s = sum(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    k = n + 1
    temp = 0
    for i in range(5):
        if (s + i) % k == 0:
            temp += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 5, `s` is the sum of the integers represented by the string `n`, and `temp` is 1 if the condition `(s + i) % k == 0` holds for any `i` in the range [0, 4], otherwise `temp` is 0.
    print(5 - temp)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `n` representing the number of Dima's friends and a list of `n` integers representing the fingers shown by Dima's friends, where each integer does not exceed 5. It calculates the sum of these integers and then checks if adding any integer from 0 to 4 to this sum results in a value divisible by `n + 1`. If such an integer exists, `temp` is incremented. After the loop, the function prints the number of integers from 0 to 4 that do not satisfy the divisibility condition, which is `5 - temp`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is 1, the value of `k` will be 2, and the loop will check divisibility by 2.
- If the sum `s` plus any integer from 0 to 4 is already divisible by `k`, `temp` will be incremented.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-integer values for `n` or non-integer or out-of-range values in the list).
