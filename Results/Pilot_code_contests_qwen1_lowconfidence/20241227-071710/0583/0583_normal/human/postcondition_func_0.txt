The function processes an integer `n` representing the number of Dima's friends and a list of `n` integers representing the fingers shown by Dima's friends, where each integer does not exceed 5. It calculates the sum of these integers and then checks if adding any integer from 0 to 4 to this sum results in a value divisible by `n + 1`. If such an integer exists, `temp` is incremented. After the loop, the function prints the number of integers from 0 to 4 that do not satisfy the divisibility condition, which is `5 - temp`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is 1, the value of `k` will be 2, and the loop will check divisibility by 2.
- If the sum `s` plus any integer from 0 to 4 is already divisible by `k`, `temp` will be incremented.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., non-integer values for `n` or non-integer or out-of-range values in the list).
