`temp` is initialized to 0. The value of `s` is the sum of the integers represented by the string `n`, and `n` is a string representing an integer number of Dima's friends. The value of `k` is the string `n` concatenated with `1`. The code does not change the values of `s` or `k`, but initializes `temp` to 0. 

Output State: **`s` is the sum of the integers represented by the string `n`, `n` is a string representing an integer number of Dima's friends, `k` is the string `n` concatenated with `1`, `temp` is 0**
