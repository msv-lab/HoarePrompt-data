`temp` is incremented by 1, but the initial values of `i` being less than 5 and `s + i` being divisible by `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `temp` and retains the conditions for `i` and `s + i`.

Output State: **`i` must be less than 5, the current value of `s + i` is divisible by `k`, `temp` is increased by 1**
