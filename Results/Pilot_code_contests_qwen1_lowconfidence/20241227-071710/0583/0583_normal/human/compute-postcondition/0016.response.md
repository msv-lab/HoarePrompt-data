The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it processes an integer `n` representing the number of Dima's friends and a list of `n` integers representing the fingers shown by Dima's friends. Each integer in the list does not exceed 5.

Based on the given information, the function will analyze the list of integers and return some form of output based on the fingers shown. Since the specific output is not detailed, we will only describe the input parameters and the expected structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes an integer `n` representing the number of Dima's friends and a list of `n` integers representing the fingers shown by Dima's friends, where each integer does not exceed 5.**
