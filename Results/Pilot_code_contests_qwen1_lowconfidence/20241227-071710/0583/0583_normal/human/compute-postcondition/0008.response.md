According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than 5.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is that `i` must be less than 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against the condition again. Since the loop is iterating over a range of 5, `i` will be incremented from its current value to the next integer.

Given that `i` was less than 5 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 5 (if it was 4 before, or the next integer less than 5). The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than 5. However, once `i` reaches 5, the loop will terminate.

Since the loop is about to enter a new iteration, `i` will be set to 5 (the next integer in the range).

The state after the next iteration starts will be:

State: **`i` is 5**
