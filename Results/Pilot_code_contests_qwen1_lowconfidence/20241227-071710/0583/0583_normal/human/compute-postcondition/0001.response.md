The code reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then calculates the sum of these integers using `sum(...)`. The result of this sum is stored in the variable `s`.

Since the initial state mentions that `n` is a string that represents an integer number of Dima's friends, we can assume that `n` is not directly affected by this code. The only affected variable is `s`.

Let's denote the input as a space-separated line of numbers. For example, if the input is "1 2 3", then `s` would be the sum of these numbers, which is 6.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:

Output State: **`s` is the sum of the integers represented by the string `n`, and `n` remains a string representing an integer number of Dima's friends.**
