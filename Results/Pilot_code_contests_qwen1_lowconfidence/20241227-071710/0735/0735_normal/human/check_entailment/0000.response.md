Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of button presses required to make each \( A_i \) a multiple of \( B_i \). Specifically, the program uses an incorrect loop direction and logic for calculating the number of increments needed.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

For the input:
```
3
3 5
2 7
9 4
```

The expected output is 7, which is correct according to the problem description. However, the program logic has issues:

1. The program iterates from `n-1` to `0`, but it should start from `0` to `n-1`.
2. The logic to calculate the number of increments is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the current value of \( A_i \) plus the accumulated count is already a multiple of \( B_i \).

To fix this, the program should iterate from `0` to `n-1` and ensure that each \( A_i \) is made a multiple of \( B_i \) by incrementing as necessary. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = (ab[i][0], ab[i][1])
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of button presses needed to satisfy the condition for each \( A_i \) being a multiple of \( B_i \).
