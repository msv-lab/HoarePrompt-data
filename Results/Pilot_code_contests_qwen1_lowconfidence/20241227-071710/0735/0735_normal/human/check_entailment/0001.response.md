Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the integer \(N\) and the pairs \((A_i, B_i)\) from standard input.
2. **Iterating in Reverse**: The program iterates over the pairs from the last pair to the first pair, which ensures that the operations are performed starting from the end, minimizing the total number of button presses.
3. **Updating Count**: For each pair, it checks if adding the current count of button presses makes \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). If not, it calculates how many additional button presses are needed to make \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\).
4. **Accumulating Presses**: It accumulates the required button presses in the variable `cnt`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should handle all valid inputs correctly. Since the provided code logic aligns with the problem statement and no counterexamples were found, the program is deemed correct.
