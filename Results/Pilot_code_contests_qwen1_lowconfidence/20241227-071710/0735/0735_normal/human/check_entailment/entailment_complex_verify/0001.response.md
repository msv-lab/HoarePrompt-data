Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). 

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the integer \(N\) and the pairs \((A_i, B_i)\) from standard input.
2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates over the pairs from the last pair to the first pair, ensuring that the operations are performed starting from the end, which minimizes the total number of button presses.
3. **Condition Check and Update**: For each pair, it checks if adding the current count of button presses makes \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). If not, it calculates how many additional button presses are needed to make \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\).
4. **Accumulated Button Presses**: It accumulates the required button presses in the variable `cnt`.

The annotated version provides further clarity that supports the correctness of the program. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
