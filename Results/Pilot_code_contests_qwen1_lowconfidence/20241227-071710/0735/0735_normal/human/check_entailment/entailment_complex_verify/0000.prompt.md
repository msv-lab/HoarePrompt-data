You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are an integer sequence A_1,...,A_N consisting of N terms, and N buttons. When the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N) button is pressed, the values of the i terms from the first through the i-th are all incremented by 1.

There is also another integer sequence B_1,...,B_N. Takahashi will push the buttons some number of times so that for every i, A_i will be a multiple of B_i.

Find the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)
* 1 ≦ B_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 B_1

A_N B_N


Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        (a, b) = (ab[i][0], ab[i][1])
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of button presses required to make each \( A_i \) a multiple of \( B_i \). Specifically, the program uses an incorrect loop direction and logic for calculating the number of increments needed.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

For the input:
```
3
3 5
2 7
9 4
```

The expected output is 7, which is correct according to the problem description. However, the program logic has issues:

1. The program iterates from `n-1` to `0`, but it should start from `0` to `n-1`.
2. The logic to calculate the number of increments is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the current value of \( A_i \) plus the accumulated count is already a multiple of \( B_i \).

To fix this, the program should iterate from `0` to `n-1` and ensure that each \( A_i \) is made a multiple of \( B_i \) by incrementing as necessary. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = (ab[i][0], ab[i][1])
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of button presses needed to satisfy the condition for each \( A_i \) being a multiple of \( B_i \).

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and two lists A and B of integers are provided where A[i] and B[i] represent the i-th terms of the sequences A and B respectively, with 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ B[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        a, b = ab[i][0], ab[i][1]
        
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    print(cnt)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts three parameters: an integer `N`, a list `A` of integers, and a list `B` of integers. It calculates a cumulative value `cnt` based on the elements of `A` and `B`. Specifically, for each element in `B` starting from the last element and moving towards the first, it checks if adding the current value of `cnt` to the corresponding element in `A` results in a multiple of the corresponding element in `B`. If not, it adjusts `cnt` by adding the difference required to make the sum a multiple of the corresponding element in `B`. After processing all elements, it prints the final value of `cnt`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `N` is at its minimum value (1), the function will process only one element.
- When `N` is at its maximum value (10^5), the function will process up to 10^5 elements, which may require efficient handling to avoid performance issues.

The function does not handle missing or invalid input (e.g., non-integer values for `N` or elements in `A` and `B`). These should be considered as potential improvements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
