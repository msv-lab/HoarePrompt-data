You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are an integer sequence A_1,...,A_N consisting of N terms, and N buttons. When the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N) button is pressed, the values of the i terms from the first through the i-th are all incremented by 1.

There is also another integer sequence B_1,...,B_N. Takahashi will push the buttons some number of times so that for every i, A_i will be a multiple of B_i.

Find the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)
* 1 ≦ B_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 B_1
:
A_N B_N


Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        (a, b) = (ab[i][0], ab[i][1])
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)


```
Output hints: The function `func()` accepts three parameters: an integer `N`, a list `A` of integers, and a list `B` of integers. It calculates a cumulative value `cnt` based on the elements of `A` and `B`. Specifically, for each element in `B` starting from the last element and moving towards the first, it checks if adding the current value of `cnt` to the corresponding element in `A` results in a multiple of the corresponding element in `B`. If not, it adjusts `cnt` by adding the difference required to make the sum a multiple of the corresponding element in `B`. After processing all elements, it prints the final value of `cnt`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `N` is at its minimum value (1), the function will process only one element.
- When `N` is at its maximum value (10^5), the function will process up to 10^5 elements, which may require efficient handling to avoid performance issues.

The function does not handle missing or invalid input (e.g., non-integer values for `N` or elements in `A` and `B`). These should be considered as potential improvements.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
