You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are an integer sequence A_1,...,A_N consisting of N terms, and N buttons. When the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N) button is pressed, the values of the i terms from the first through the i-th are all incremented by 1.

There is also another integer sequence B_1,...,B_N. Takahashi will push the buttons some number of times so that for every i, A_i will be a multiple of B_i.

Find the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)
* 1 ≦ B_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 B_1
:
A_N B_N


Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        (a, b) = (ab[i][0], ab[i][1])
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
    print(cnt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). Here’s a breakdown of why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the integer \(N\) and the pairs \((A_i, B_i)\) from standard input.
2. **Iterating in Reverse**: The program iterates over the pairs from the last pair to the first pair, which ensures that the operations are performed starting from the end, minimizing the total number of button presses.
3. **Updating Count**: For each pair, it checks if adding the current count of button presses makes \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). If not, it calculates how many additional button presses are needed to make \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\).
4. **Accumulating Presses**: It accumulates the required button presses in the variable `cnt`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should handle all valid inputs correctly. Since the provided code logic aligns with the problem statement and no counterexamples were found, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and two lists A and B of integers are provided where A[i] and B[i] represent the i-th terms of the sequences A and B respectively, with 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ B[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        a, b = ab[i][0], ab[i][1]
        
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    print(cnt)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
