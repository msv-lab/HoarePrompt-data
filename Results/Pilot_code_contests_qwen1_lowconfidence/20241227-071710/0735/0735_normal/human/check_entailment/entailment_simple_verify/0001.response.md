Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of button presses required to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). 

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the integer \(N\) and the pairs \((A_i, B_i)\) from standard input, which matches the problem requirements.
2. **Iterating in Reverse**: The program iterates over the pairs from the last pair to the first pair, ensuring that the operations are performed starting from the end, which minimizes the total number of button presses.
3. **Updating Count**: For each pair, it checks if adding the current count of button presses makes \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). If not, it calculates the additional button presses needed and updates the count accordingly.
4. **Accumulating Presses**: The program accumulates the required button presses in the variable `cnt`.

The annotated version confirms that the program handles the input and operations as expected, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained as **True**.
