Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the integer \( N \) and then reads \( N \) pairs of integers \((A_i, B_i)\).
   - The input format and constraints are handled appropriately, assuming valid input.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - The program initializes `cnt` to 0, which will accumulate the total number of button presses.
   - It iterates over the pairs \((A_i, B_i)\) from the last to the first.
   - For each pair, it checks if \((A_i + cnt)\) is already a multiple of \(B_i\). If it is, no additional button presses are needed for that term.
   - If \((A_i + cnt)\) is not a multiple of \(B_i\), it calculates the required increment to make \((A_i + cnt)\) a multiple of \(B_i\) and adds this to `cnt`.

3. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The algorithm ensures that after processing all pairs, the value of \(A_i\) will be a multiple of \(B_i\) for all \(i\).
   - By working backwards from the last term to the first, it minimizes the total number of button presses required.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(N\) is 1 by processing only one pair.
   - For larger \(N\), the program processes up to \(10^5\) pairs efficiently.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum number of button presses needed to make each \(A_i\) a multiple of \(B_i\). Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
