You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are an integer sequence A_1,...,A_N consisting of N terms, and N buttons. When the i-th (1 ≦ i ≦ N) button is pressed, the values of the i terms from the first through the i-th are all incremented by 1.

There is also another integer sequence B_1,...,B_N. Takahashi will push the buttons some number of times so that for every i, A_i will be a multiple of B_i.

Find the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 1 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 0 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)
* 1 ≦ B_i ≦ 10^9(1 ≦ i ≦ N)

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 B_1
:
A_N B_N


Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of times Takahashi will press the buttons.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and two lists A and B of integers are provided where A[i] and B[i] represent the i-th terms of the sequences A and B respectively, with 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ B[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]
    cnt = 0
    for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
        a, b = ab[i][0], ab[i][1]
        
        if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
            continue
        
        cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    print(cnt)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func()` accepts three parameters: an integer `N`, a list `A` of integers, and a list `B` of integers. It calculates a cumulative value `cnt` based on the elements of `A` and `B`. Specifically, for each element in `B` starting from the last element and moving towards the first, it checks if adding the current value of `cnt` to the corresponding element in `A` results in a multiple of the corresponding element in `B`. If not, it adjusts `cnt` by adding the difference required to make the sum a multiple of the corresponding element in `B`. After processing all elements, it prints the final value of `cnt`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `N` is at its minimum value (1), the function will process only one element.
- When `N` is at its maximum value (10^5), the function will process up to 10^5 elements, which may require efficient handling to avoid performance issues.

The function does not handle missing or invalid input (e.g., non-integer values for `N` or elements in `A` and `B`). These should be considered as potential improvements.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
