Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the minimum number of button presses to make each \( A_i \) a multiple of \( B_i \). However, the current implementation does not achieve this goal.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Button Presses**:
   - The program iterates over the sequences in reverse order (`i` starts from `n-1` to `0`). While iterating in reverse can sometimes be useful, it does not inherently address the problem at hand.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed. It attempts to increment `cnt` to make `a + cnt` a multiple of `b`, but it does not correctly calculate the required increments for all preceding elements.

2. **Lack of Consideration for Cumulative Effects**:
   - The program does not account for the cumulative effect of button presses on previous elements. Each button press affects multiple elements, and the solution needs to consider these interactions to find the minimum number of presses.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the result directly without following the specified output format. According to the problem description, the output should be an integer representing the minimum number of button presses. However, the current implementation does not ensure this.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate through the sequences in the correct order and ensure that each \( A_i \) becomes a multiple of \( B_i \) by calculating the necessary increments for each element considering the cumulative effect on preceding elements.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ab = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize the result counter
    cnt = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sequences from the beginning to the end
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = ab[i]
        
        # Calculate the required increment to make A[i] a multiple of B[i]
        if a % b != 0:
            # Find the smallest increment needed
            increment = b - (a % b)
            cnt += increment
            # Update A[i] to ensure it's a multiple of B[i]
            ab[i][0] += increment
    
    # Print the result
    print(cnt)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Iterate in the Correct Order**:
   - The program iterates through the sequences from the beginning to the end (`for i in range(n)`).

2. **Calculate Required Increment**:
   - For each \( A_i \), it calculates the required increment to make \( A_i \) a multiple of \( B_i \).
   - If \( A_i \mod B_i \neq 0 \), it calculates the smallest increment needed (`increment = b - (a % b)`).

3. **Update and Accumulate**:
   - The increment is added to `cnt` and applied to \( A_i \) to ensure it becomes a multiple of \( B_i \).
   - The updated value of \( A_i \) is stored back in `ab[i][0]`.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Finally, the total count of button presses is printed.

This approach ensures that the program correctly finds the minimum number of button presses to satisfy the conditions stated in the problem description.
