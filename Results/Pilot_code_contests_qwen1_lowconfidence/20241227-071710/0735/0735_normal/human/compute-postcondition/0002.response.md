The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the value of `n` or the list `ab`. The only change is that `cnt` is now set to 0. 

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `ab` is a list of n tuples, each tuple contains two integers converted from the space-separated inputs, `cnt` is 0**
