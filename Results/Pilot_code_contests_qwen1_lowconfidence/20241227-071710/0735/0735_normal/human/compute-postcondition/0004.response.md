`a` and `b` are assigned the values from `ab[i]`, specifically `a` gets `ab[i][0]` and `b` gets `ab[i][1]`. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, but the actual values of `a` and `b` depend on the contents of `ab[i]`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 is still valid.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is `ab[i][0]`, `b` is `ab[i][1]`**
