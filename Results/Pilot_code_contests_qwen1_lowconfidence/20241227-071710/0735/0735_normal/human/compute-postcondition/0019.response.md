To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer.
- `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers.
- `cnt` is initialized to 0.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
    a, b = ab[i][0], ab[i][1]
    if (a + cnt) % b == 0:
        continue
    cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the indices of the `ab` list in reverse order, starting from `n-1` down to `0`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each tuple `(a, b)` in `ab`, it checks if `(a + cnt) % b == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop skips the increment operation. Otherwise, it updates `cnt` by adding `b - (a + cnt) % b`.

### Key Observations
- **Final Value of `cnt`**: The final value of `cnt` depends on the sequence of operations performed within the loop. Each iteration modifies `cnt` based on the current tuple `(a, b)`.
- **No Break Condition**: There is no explicit break condition in the loop, meaning the loop will continue until it processes all elements in `ab` in reverse order.
- **No Change in `n` and `ab`**: The values of `n` and `ab` do not change within the loop.
- **Value of `i`**: After `n` iterations, `i` will be `-1` because the loop starts from `n-1` and decrements by 1 each time until it reaches `-1`.

### Conclusion
After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop. Since the loop runs in reverse order and performs the update operation only when `(a + cnt) % b != 0`, the final value of `cnt` will be such that for every tuple `(a, b)` in `ab`, the expression `(a + cnt) % b` evaluates to 0, or as close to 0 as possible without exceeding `b`.

### Output State
The loop will execute exactly `n` times, processing each tuple in `ab` in reverse order. The final value of `cnt` will ensure that for every tuple `(a, b)` in `ab`, the condition `(a + cnt) % b == 0` holds true.

**Output State:**
**`n` is an integer, `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, each tuple contains two integers, `cnt` is the final value after processing all tuples in reverse order such that for every tuple `(a, b)` in `ab`, `(a + cnt) % b == 0`.**
