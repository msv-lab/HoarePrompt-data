The `continue` statement in the code does not change the values of any variables; it simply moves to the next iteration of the loop (if there is one). Since no values are altered, the initial values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is now `n - 2`, `a` is now `ab[i][0]`, `b` is now `ab[i][1]`, and `cnt` is the same as before.**
