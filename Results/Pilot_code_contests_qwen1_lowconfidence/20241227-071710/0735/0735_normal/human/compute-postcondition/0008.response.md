Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` is `ab[i][0]`.
   - `b` is `ab[i][1]`.

2. Code:
   ```python
   cnt += b - (a + cnt) % b
   ```

3. Impact of the Code:
   - The value of `cnt` is updated based on the formula `b - (a + cnt) % b`.
   - We need to consider the current values of `a`, `b`, and `cnt` to determine the new value of `cnt`.

4. Calculation:
   - Let's denote the initial value of `cnt` as `cnt_initial`.
   - The new value of `cnt` is calculated as `cnt_initial + b - (a + cnt_initial) % b`.

Since the exact initial values of `a`, `b`, and `cnt` are not specified, let's express the final value of `cnt` in terms of these variables.

Final Value of `cnt`:
- `cnt` is updated to `cnt + b - (a + cnt) % b`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is `ab[i][0]`, `b` is `ab[i][1]`, and `cnt` is `cnt + b - (a + cnt) % b`.**
