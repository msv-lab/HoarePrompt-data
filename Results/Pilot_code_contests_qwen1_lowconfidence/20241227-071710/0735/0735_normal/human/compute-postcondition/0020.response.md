The code `print(cnt)` simply prints the value of the variable `cnt`. However, since no value is assigned to `cnt` before this line, `cnt` remains undefined. Printing an undefined variable does not change its state or assign a new value to it. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`cnt` is undefined**
