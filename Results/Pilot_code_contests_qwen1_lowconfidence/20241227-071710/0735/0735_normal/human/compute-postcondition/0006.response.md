The `continue` statement in the code is used to skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration of the loop. It does not affect the values of any variables but rather controls the flow of the loop. Since no variables are reassigned or affected within the loop (as this is a single line without any operations), the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is `ab[i][0]`, `b` is `ab[i][1]`, the current value of `(a + cnt) % b` is 0**
