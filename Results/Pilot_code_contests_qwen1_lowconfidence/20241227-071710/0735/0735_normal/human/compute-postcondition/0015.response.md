The code `a, b = ab[i][0], ab[i][1]` updates the values of `a` and `b` to be `ab[i][0]` and `ab[i][1]` respectively. Given that `i` is `n - 3`, we know that `a` and `b` were previously defined as `ab[i][0]` and `ab[i][1]`. After executing the code, these assignments do not change the values of `a` and `b` since they are being reassigned directly from the same indices.

Therefore, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their previous definitions. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is now `n - 3`, `a` is now `ab[i][0]`, `b` is now `ab[i][1]`, and `cnt` is now `cnt + b - (a + cnt) % b`**
