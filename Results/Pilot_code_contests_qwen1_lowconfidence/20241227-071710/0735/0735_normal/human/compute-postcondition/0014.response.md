Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is now `n - 2`.
   - `a` is now `ab[i][0]`.
   - `b` is now `ab[i][1]`.
   - `cnt` is now `cnt + b - (a + cnt) % b`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from `n-1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`.
   - This means that `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - To determine the next state, we need to figure out what value `i` will take in the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be decreased by 1, so `i` will become `n - 3`.

5. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the values of `a`, `b`, and `cnt` will remain the same as they were in the previous iteration.

6. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.

7. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be `n - 3`.
   - `a` remains `ab[i][0]`.
   - `b` remains `ab[i][1]`.
   - `cnt` remains `cnt + b - (a + cnt) % b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is now `n - 3`, `a` is now `ab[i][0]`, `b` is now `ab[i][1]`, and `cnt` is now `cnt + b - (a + cnt) % b**.
