The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `A`, and `B`. 

- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\).
- `A` and `B` are lists of integers where for all \(1 \leq i \leq N\), \(0 \leq A[i] \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq B[i] \leq 10^9\).

Based on the given output cases, we need to determine the return value. However, since no specific return values or conditions are provided in the output, we can only state the parameters and their constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `N` and two lists of integers `A` and `B`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^5\)), A (a list of integers where \(0 \leq A[i] \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq N\)), and B (a list of integers where \(1 \leq B[i] \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq N\)).**
