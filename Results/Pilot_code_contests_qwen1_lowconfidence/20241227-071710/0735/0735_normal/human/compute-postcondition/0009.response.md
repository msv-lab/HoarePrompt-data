Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `a` is `ab[i][0]`.
   - `b` is `ab[i][1]`.
   - `cnt` is `cnt + b - (a + cnt) % b`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n - 1` to `i = 0` with a decrement of 1 each time.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - The loop just completed an iteration where `i` was decremented by 1 from its value in the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, if `i` was previously `n - 1`, it is now `n - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - Since `i` is now `n - 2`, the condition `i >= 0` translates to `n - 2 >= 0`, which means `n` must be at least 2.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be `n - 2`.
   - `a` will be `ab[n-2][0]`.
   - `b` will be `ab[n-2][1]`.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted here, but we know the updated value of `cnt` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is `ab[n-2][0]`, `b` is `ab[n-2][1]`, and `cnt` is the same as before.**
