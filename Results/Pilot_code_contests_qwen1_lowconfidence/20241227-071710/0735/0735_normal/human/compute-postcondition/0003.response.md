To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step-by-step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ab` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers.
- `cnt` is initialized to 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` to `-1` in steps of `-1`. This means the loop will run `n` times, starting from `n - 1` and decrementing `i` until `i` reaches `-1`.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `i` will take on the values `n - 1`, `n - 2`, ..., 0, `-1` in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the range `xrange(n - 1, -1, -1)` is valid.
   - This range is valid if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. Since `n` is an integer input, this condition simplifies to `n` being at least 1.

### State Adjustment:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` will start at `n - 1` and decrement in each iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`**.
