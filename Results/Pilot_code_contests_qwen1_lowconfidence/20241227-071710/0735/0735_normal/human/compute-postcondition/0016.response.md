The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Given the initial state and the presence of the `continue` statement, the values of `i`, `a`, `b`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is now `n - 3`, `a` is now `ab[i][0]`, `b` is now `ab[i][1]`, and `cnt` is now `cnt + b - (a + cnt) % b`**
