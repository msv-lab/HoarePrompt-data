Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is `ab[i][0]`, `b` is `ab[i][1]`, and after the execution of the if-else block, if `(a + cnt) % b` equals 0, no further changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables since there is no else part provided.***
