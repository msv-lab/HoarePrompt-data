The code `ab = [map(int, raw_input().split()) for _ in xrange(n)]` reads `n` lines of space-separated integers from the standard input and converts them into a list of tuples. Each tuple contains pairs of integers (one pair per line) that were read from the input. 

Since `n` is the input integer and `1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10^5`, `n` remains the same, but now it also holds the number of tuples in the `ab` list. Each tuple in `ab` is formed by converting the space-separated integers from each line of input into integers.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `ab`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `ab` is a list of n tuples, each tuple contains two integers converted from the space-separated inputs.**
