You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have N switches with "on" and "off" state, and M bulbs. The switches are numbered 1 to N, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to M.

Bulb i is connected to k_i switches: Switch s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., and s_{ik_i}. It is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among these switches is congruent to p_i modulo 2.

How many combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches light all the bulbs?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 10
* 1 \leq k_i \leq N
* 1 \leq s_{ij} \leq N
* s_{ia} \neq s_{ib} (a \neq b)
* p_i is 0 or 1.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
k_1 s_{11} s_{12} ... s_{1k_1}
:
k_M s_{M1} s_{M2} ... s_{Mk_M}
p_1 p_2 ... p_M


Output

Print the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches that light all the bulbs.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(N, M) = map(int, raw_input().split())
ks = []
for i in range(M):
    ks2 = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ks.append(ks2)
pm = map(int, raw_input().split())
plist = []
for i in ks:
    t = [0] * N
    ini = 1
    for j in i:
        if ini == 1:
            ini = 0
            continue
        else:
            t[j - 1] = 1
    plist.append(t)
slist = []
for i in range(2 ** N):
    t = []
    for j in range(N):
        t.append(i % 2)
        i = i / 2
    slist.append(t)
r = 0
for p in plist:
    s2 = []
    for s in slist:
        if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r]:
            s2.append(s)
    r = r + 1
    slist = s2
print(len(slist))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing N (the number of switches), b is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer representing k_i and a list of integers representing s_{ij} for each bulb, and the last element of b is a list of integers representing p_i.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        c += a[i] * b[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list with at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `b` is a list of tuples, `c` is the sum of the products of the first elements of `a` and the first elements of `b` for each index from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
    return c
    #`The program returns the sum of the products of the first elements of list 'a' and the first elements of list 'b' for each index from 0 to len(a) - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers, and `b`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `b` contains an integer and a list of integers. The function iterates over the indices of `a`, multiplying the corresponding elements of `a` and the first elements of `b` (which are integers), and sums these products. The function returns the computed sum. The function assumes that both `a` and `b` have the same length, and that `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple has at least two elements. If `a` is empty or `b` is empty, the function will still work correctly, returning 0. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
