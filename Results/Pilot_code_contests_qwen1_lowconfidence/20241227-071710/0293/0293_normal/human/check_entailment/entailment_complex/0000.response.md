Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the input values for \(N\) (number of switches) and \(M\) (number of bulbs).
   - It then processes the connections between switches and bulbs, storing them in a suitable data structure (`ks`).

2. **Switch State Calculation**:
   - For each bulb, the program constructs a binary list `t` indicating which switches control the bulb.
   - These lists are stored in `plist`.

3. **Combinations Generation**:
   - The program generates all possible combinations of switch states using a bitmask approach, storing them in `slist`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a switch state (`a`) and a list of tuples (`b`), each tuple containing a switch index and its state.
   - It calculates the dot product of the switch state vector and the weight vector derived from the connections, which determines if the bulb is lit.
   - This function correctly computes whether the number of "on" switches controlling a bulb is even or odd (depending on `pm`), matching the condition specified in the problem.

5. **Filtering Valid Combinations**:
   - The program iterates through all possible switch states and filters out those that do not satisfy the lighting conditions for all bulbs.
   - It uses the function `func_1` to check the conditions and retains only the valid combinations.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the count of valid switch states that light all the bulbs.

The program handles all aspects of the problem statement, including the constraints and the expected output format. The provided explanation and the logical flow of the code confirm that it correctly implements the solution to the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
