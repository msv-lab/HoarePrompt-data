Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is incorrectly defined and used. The function expects a list `a` and a list of tuples `b`, but the actual usage in the code is incorrect. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a list `a` and a list of tuples `b`, but it is never called with such arguments. Instead, it is used in the context of computing the dot product between a binary switch state and a list of connections for each bulb.

2. **Incorrect Usage of `func_1`**: In the main part of the code, `func_1` is used to compute the dot product between the switch state `s` and the connection list `p` (where `p` is actually a single integer representing the parity condition). However, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to handle this use case. It should simply compute the dot product between the switch state and the connection list, but it is incorrectly defined to multiply elements and then sum them.

3. **Connection List Representation**: The connection list `p` should be a list of integers indicating which switches are connected to each bulb, but it is being used as a single integer (`pm[r]`). This means the function `func_1` is being called incorrectly, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Logic for Checking Conditions**: The logic for checking whether a switch state satisfies the condition for each bulb is flawed. The code should check if the number of "on" switches among the connected switches is congruent to `p_i` modulo 2, but it does not correctly implement this logic.

Here is a corrected version of the code that implements the correct logic:

```python
(N, M) = map(int, input().split())
connections = []
for _ in range(M):
    ks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    connections.append([ks[0]] + ks[1:])
pm = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = 0
for state in range(2 ** N):
    state_bits = [state >> i & 1 for i in range(N)]
    if all(sum(state_bits[s-1] for s in con) % 2 == p for con, p in zip(connections, pm)):
        count += 1

print(count)
```

This corrected code correctly computes the number of switch states that satisfy the conditions for all bulbs.
