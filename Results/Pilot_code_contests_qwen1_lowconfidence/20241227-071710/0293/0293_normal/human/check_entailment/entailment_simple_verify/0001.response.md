Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotations and the original assessment, the program still has a logical error despite the intended correction in the `func_1` function. The issue lies in how the function `func_1` is used and the logic around it.

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` currently computes the sum of the products of corresponding elements in two lists and returns the result without applying the modulo condition. This means that even though the function has been updated to correctly compute the sum modulo 2, the way it is being used in the program is incorrect.

2. **Usage of `func_1`**: In the main part of the program, `func_1(p, s)` is called and its result is checked against `pm[r]` using the condition `if func_1(p, s) % 2 == pm[r]`. This condition checks if the sum of the products of corresponding elements in `p` and `s` is congruent to `pm[r]` modulo 2. However, the problem specifies that `p_i` is either 0 or 1, and the condition should check if the number of "on" switches connected to a bulb is congruent to `p_i` modulo 2.

3. **Correct Logic**: The correct logic should be to count the number of "on" switches (1s in the list `p`) that are present in the configuration `s` and check if this count is congruent to `pm[r]` modulo 2. The current implementation of `func_1` and its usage do not reflect this requirement accurately.

Given these points, the program still does not correctly implement the problem requirements, and therefore the original assessment remains accurate. The final assessment is:

Final: **False**
