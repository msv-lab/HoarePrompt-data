Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it checks the conditions for each bulb. Specifically, the `func_1` function computes the dot product of two lists `a` and `b`, but it does not account for the modulo condition specified in the problem description. 

The problem requires checking if the number of "on" switches connected to a bulb is congruent to \( p_i \) modulo 2. However, the current implementation of `func_1` simply returns the sum of the products of corresponding elements in the two lists, which does not correctly implement the modulo condition.

To fix this, the function should check if the sum of the products is congruent to \( p_i \) modulo 2 and only include those switch configurations in the final list `s2`. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        c += a[i] * b[i]
    return c % 2
```

With this correction, the program should correctly count the number of valid switch configurations that light all the bulbs according to the given conditions.
