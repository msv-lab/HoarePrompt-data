Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the number of switches that are "on" among the specified switches for each bulb is congruent to \(p_i\) modulo 2. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to calculate the dot product of two lists, but this calculation alone is not sufficient to determine whether the number of "on" switches is even or odd for each bulb. 

The program needs to count the number of "on" switches for each bulb and check if this count is congruent to \(p_i\) modulo 2. However, the current implementation only checks if the sum of the corresponding elements in the two lists is even or odd, which is not equivalent to counting the number of "on" switches for each bulb.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 2
3 1 2 5
2 2 3
1 0
```

The correct output should be 8, as the explanation in the problem statement indicates. However, the given program will not produce the correct result because it incorrectly checks the dot product instead of counting the number of "on" switches for each bulb.
