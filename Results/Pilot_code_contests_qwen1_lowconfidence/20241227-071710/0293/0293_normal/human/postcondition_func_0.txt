The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers, and `b`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `b` contains an integer and a list of integers. The function iterates over the indices of `a`, multiplying the corresponding elements of `a` and the first elements of `b` (which are integers), and sums these products. The function returns the computed sum. The function assumes that both `a` and `b` have the same length, and that `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple has at least two elements. If `a` is empty or `b` is empty, the function will still work correctly, returning 0. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
