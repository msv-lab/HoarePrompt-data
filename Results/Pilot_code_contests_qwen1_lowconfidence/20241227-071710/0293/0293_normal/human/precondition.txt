a and b are integers representing the number of switches (N) and the number of bulbs (M) respectively, where 1 â‰¤ N, M â‰¤ 10. Additionally, there are M lines that each contain integers k_i and k_i space-separated integers s_{ij} representing the number of switches connected to bulb i and the specific switch numbers. The last line contains M space-separated integers p_i where each p_i is either 0 or 1.
