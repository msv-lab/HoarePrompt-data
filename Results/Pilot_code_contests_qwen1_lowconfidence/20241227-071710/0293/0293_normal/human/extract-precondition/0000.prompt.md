You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: We have N switches with "on" and "off" state, and M bulbs. The switches are numbered 1 to N, and the bulbs are numbered 1 to M.

Bulb i is connected to k_i switches: Switch s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., and s_{ik_i}. It is lighted when the number of switches that are "on" among these switches is congruent to p_i modulo 2.

How many combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches light all the bulbs?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N, M \leq 10
* 1 \leq k_i \leq N
* 1 \leq s_{ij} \leq N
* s_{ia} \neq s_{ib} (a \neq b)
* p_i is 0 or 1.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
k_1 s_{11} s_{12} ... s_{1k_1}
:
k_M s_{M1} s_{M2} ... s_{Mk_M}
p_1 p_2 ... p_M


Output

Print the number of combinations of "on" and "off" states of the switches that light all the bulbs.
