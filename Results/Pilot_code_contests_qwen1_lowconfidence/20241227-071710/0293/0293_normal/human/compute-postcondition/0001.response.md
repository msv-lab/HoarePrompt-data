According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop iterates over the range of the length of `a`, meaning `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the required adjustments:

1. **Variable `a`**: Since the loop iterates based on the length of `a`, `a` must have at least one element.
2. **Variable `b`**: The value of `b` itself is not directly used in the loop, but the structure and content of `b` should be mentioned to ensure clarity.
3. **Variable `c`**: The value of `c` is given as 0, and this does not affect the loop execution condition.
4. **Variable `i`**: Before entering the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, the starting index of the loop.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `a` must have at least one element.
- `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

The final answer is:
State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `b` is a list of tuples, `c` is 0**
