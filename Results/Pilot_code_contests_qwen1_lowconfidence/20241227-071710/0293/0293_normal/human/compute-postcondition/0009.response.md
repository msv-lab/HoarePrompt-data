The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is an integer representing N (the number of switches), and `b` is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `b` contains an integer representing \( k_i \) and a list of integers representing \( s_{ij} \) for each bulb, with the last element of `b` being a list of integers representing \( p_i \).

The function returns the sum of the products of the first elements of list `a` and the first elements of list `b` for each index from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `a` and a list of tuples `b`, and return the sum of the products of the first elements of `a` and the first elements of `b` for each index.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a` (an integer) and a parameter `b` (a list of tuples). It returns the sum of the products of the first elements of `a` and the first elements of `b` for each index.**
