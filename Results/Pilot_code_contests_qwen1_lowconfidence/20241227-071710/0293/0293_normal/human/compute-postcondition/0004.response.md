`c` is incremented by `a[i] * b[i]`. Given the initial state, `a` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `b` is a list of tuples, and `c` is the product of the first elements of `a` and `b`. Since `i` is 1, we use the first element of `a` and the first element of the tuple in the first position of `b` for the calculation.

Let's denote the first element of `a` as `a[1]` and the first element of the tuple in `b` as `b[0][0]`. Therefore, `c` becomes `c + a[1] * b[0][0]`.

Output State: **`a` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `b` is a list of tuples, `c` is the product of the first elements of `a` and `b` plus `a[1] * b[0][0]`**
