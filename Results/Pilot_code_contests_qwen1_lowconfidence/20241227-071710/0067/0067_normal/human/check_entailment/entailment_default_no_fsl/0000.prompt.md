You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Professor GukiZ doesn't accept string as they are. He likes to swap some letters in string to obtain a new one.

GukiZ has strings a, b, and c. He wants to obtain string k by swapping some letters in a, so that k should contain as many non-overlapping substrings equal either to b or c as possible. Substring of string x is a string formed by consecutive segment of characters from x. Two substrings of string x overlap if there is position i in string x occupied by both of them.

GukiZ was disappointed because none of his students managed to solve the problem. Can you help them and find one of possible strings k?

Input

The first line contains string a, the second line contains string b, and the third line contains string c (1 ≤ |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 105, where |s| denotes the length of string s).

All three strings consist only of lowercase English letters. 

It is possible that b and c coincide.

Output

Find one of possible strings k, as described in the problem statement. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input

aaa
a
b


Output

aaa

Input

pozdravstaklenidodiri
niste
dobri


Output

nisteaadddiiklooprrvz

Input

abbbaaccca
ab
aca


Output

ababacabcc

Note

In the third sample, this optimal solutions has three non-overlaping substrings equal to either b or c on positions 1 – 2 (ab), 3 – 4 (ab), 5 – 7 (aca). In this sample, there exist many other optimal solutions, one of them would be acaababbcc.
Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

a = raw_input()
b = raw_input()
c = raw_input()
ta = func_1(a)
tb = func_1(b)
tc = func_1(c)
maxb = min([ta[char] / tb[char] for char in tb])
ans = maxb
bocc = maxb
for i in range(1, maxb + 1):
    maxc = min([(ta[char] - tb[char] * i) / tc[char] for char in tc])
    if maxc + i > ans:
        ans = maxc + i
        bocc = i
for i in range(bocc):
    sys.stdout.write(b)
for i in range(ans - bocc):
    sys.stdout.write(c)
for char in ta:
    rem = ta[char] - bocc * tb[char] - (ans - bocc) * tb[char]
    for i in range(rem):
        sys.stdout.write(char)

def func_1(word):
    table = defaultdict(int)
    for char in word:
        table[char] += 1
    return table


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `word`, which is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. It creates a dictionary `table` that maps each unique character in `word` to its count within `word`. After executing the function, the final state of the program is such that the variable `table` contains this dictionary. The function handles the case where `word` is an empty string by initializing the dictionary with no entries, although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations. There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
