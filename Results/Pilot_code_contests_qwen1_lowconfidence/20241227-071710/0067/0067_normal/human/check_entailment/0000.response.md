Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the number of non-overlapping substrings equal to either `b` or `c` in the resulting string `k`. The program uses a formulaic approach to calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings but does not ensure that the resulting string `k` contains these substrings in a way that maximizes their number and non-overlapping nature.

For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
aabbc
b
c
```

Expected output:
```
bbcc
```

However, the program's output for this input is incorrect. The program attempts to use a formula to determine the number of times `b` and `c` can appear in the result string but does not construct the string `k` by ensuring the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings. The current implementation might produce a string like `abcbcc` or another incorrect combination where the substrings `b` and `c` are not placed optimally to maximize their count without overlapping.

To fix this, the program needs to dynamically construct the string `k` by iteratively placing the substrings `b` and `c` while ensuring no overlaps, which is not currently implemented in the given code.
