You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Professor GukiZ doesn't accept string as they are. He likes to swap some letters in string to obtain a new one.

GukiZ has strings a, b, and c. He wants to obtain string k by swapping some letters in a, so that k should contain as many non-overlapping substrings equal either to b or c as possible. Substring of string x is a string formed by consecutive segment of characters from x. Two substrings of string x overlap if there is position i in string x occupied by both of them.

GukiZ was disappointed because none of his students managed to solve the problem. Can you help them and find one of possible strings k?

Input

The first line contains string a, the second line contains string b, and the third line contains string c (1 ≤ |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 105, where |s| denotes the length of string s).

All three strings consist only of lowercase English letters. 

It is possible that b and c coincide.

Output

Find one of possible strings k, as described in the problem statement. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input

aaa
a
b


Output

aaa

Input

pozdravstaklenidodiri
niste
dobri


Output

nisteaadddiiklooprrvz

Input

abbbaaccca
ab
aca


Output

ababacabcc

Note

In the third sample, this optimal solutions has three non-overlaping substrings equal to either b or c on positions 1 – 2 (ab), 3 – 4 (ab), 5 – 7 (aca). In this sample, there exist many other optimal solutions, one of them would be acaababbcc.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

a = raw_input()
b = raw_input()
c = raw_input()
ta = func_1(a)
tb = func_1(b)
tc = func_1(c)
maxb = min([ta[char] / tb[char] for char in tb])
ans = maxb
bocc = maxb
for i in range(1, maxb + 1):
    maxc = min([(ta[char] - tb[char] * i) / tc[char] for char in tc])
    if maxc + i > ans:
        ans = maxc + i
        bocc = i
for i in range(bocc):
    sys.stdout.write(b)
for i in range(ans - bocc):
    sys.stdout.write(c)
for char in ta:
    rem = ta[char] - bocc * tb[char] - (ans - bocc) * tb[char]
    for i in range(rem):
        sys.stdout.write(char)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and strings b and c are also strings consisting of lowercase English letters. The lengths of all three strings do not exceed 100,000 characters.
def func_1(word):
    table = defaultdict(int)
    for char in word:
        table[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `table` is a dictionary mapping keys to integers with a default value of 0 where for each character `char` in `word`, `table[char]` is the count of `char` in `word`.
    return table
    #`table` is a dictionary where each key is a character from `word` and its corresponding value is the count of that character in `word`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `word`, which is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. It creates a dictionary `table` that maps each unique character in `word` to its count within `word`. After executing the function, the final state of the program is such that the variable `table` contains this dictionary. The function handles the case where `word` is an empty string by initializing the dictionary with no entries, although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations. There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
