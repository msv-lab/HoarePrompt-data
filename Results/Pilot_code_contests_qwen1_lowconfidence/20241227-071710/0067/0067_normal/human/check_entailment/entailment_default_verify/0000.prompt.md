You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Professor GukiZ doesn't accept string as they are. He likes to swap some letters in string to obtain a new one.

GukiZ has strings a, b, and c. He wants to obtain string k by swapping some letters in a, so that k should contain as many non-overlapping substrings equal either to b or c as possible. Substring of string x is a string formed by consecutive segment of characters from x. Two substrings of string x overlap if there is position i in string x occupied by both of them.

GukiZ was disappointed because none of his students managed to solve the problem. Can you help them and find one of possible strings k?

Input

The first line contains string a, the second line contains string b, and the third line contains string c (1 ≤ |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 105, where |s| denotes the length of string s).

All three strings consist only of lowercase English letters. 

It is possible that b and c coincide.

Output

Find one of possible strings k, as described in the problem statement. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input

aaa
a
b


Output

aaa

Input

pozdravstaklenidodiri
niste
dobri


Output

nisteaadddiiklooprrvz

Input

abbbaaccca
ab
aca


Output

ababacabcc

Note

In the third sample, this optimal solutions has three non-overlaping substrings equal to either b or c on positions 1 – 2 (ab), 3 – 4 (ab), 5 – 7 (aca). In this sample, there exist many other optimal solutions, one of them would be acaababbcc.
Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

a = raw_input()
b = raw_input()
c = raw_input()
ta = func_1(a)
tb = func_1(b)
tc = func_1(c)
maxb = min([ta[char] / tb[char] for char in tb])
ans = maxb
bocc = maxb
for i in range(1, maxb + 1):
    maxc = min([(ta[char] - tb[char] * i) / tc[char] for char in tc])
    if maxc + i > ans:
        ans = maxc + i
        bocc = i
for i in range(bocc):
    sys.stdout.write(b)
for i in range(ans - bocc):
    sys.stdout.write(c)
for char in ta:
    rem = ta[char] - bocc * tb[char] - (ans - bocc) * tb[char]
    for i in range(rem):
        sys.stdout.write(char)

def func_1(word):
    table = defaultdict(int)
    for char in word:
        table[char] += 1
    return table


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the number of non-overlapping substrings equal to either `b` or `c` in the resulting string `k`. The program uses a formulaic approach to calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings but does not ensure that the resulting string `k` contains these substrings in a way that maximizes their number and non-overlapping nature.

For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
aabbc
b
c
```

Expected output:
```
bbcc
```

However, the program's output for this input is incorrect. The program attempts to use a formula to determine the number of times `b` and `c` can appear in the result string but does not construct the string `k` by ensuring the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings. The current implementation might produce a string like `abcbcc` or another incorrect combination where the substrings `b` and `c` are not placed optimally to maximize their count without overlapping.

To fix this, the program needs to dynamically construct the string `k` by iteratively placing the substrings `b` and `c` while ensuring no overlaps, which is not currently implemented in the given code.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `word`, which is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. It creates a dictionary `table` that maps each unique character in `word` to its count within `word`. After executing the function, the final state of the program is such that the variable `table` contains this dictionary. The function handles the case where `word` is an empty string by initializing the dictionary with no entries, although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations. There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
