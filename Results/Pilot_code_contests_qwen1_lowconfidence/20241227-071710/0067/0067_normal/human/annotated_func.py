#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and strings b and c are also strings consisting of lowercase English letters. The lengths of all three strings do not exceed 100,000 characters.
def func_1(word):
    table = defaultdict(int)
    for char in word:
        table[char] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `table` is a dictionary mapping keys to integers with a default value of 0 where for each character `char` in `word`, `table[char]` is the count of `char` in `word`.
    return table
    #`table` is a dictionary where each key is a character from `word` and its corresponding value is the count of that character in `word`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `word`, which is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. It creates a dictionary `table` that maps each unique character in `word` to its count within `word`. After executing the function, the final state of the program is such that the variable `table` contains this dictionary. The function handles the case where `word` is an empty string by initializing the dictionary with no entries, although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations. There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
