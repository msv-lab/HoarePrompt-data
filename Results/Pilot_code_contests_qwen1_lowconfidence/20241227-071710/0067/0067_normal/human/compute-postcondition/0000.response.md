The code initializes a default dictionary named `table` with an integer default factory (default value of 0). This means that `table` is now a dictionary that maps keys to integers, and any key that is not already in the dictionary will default to 0 when accessed.

Since no keys or values are added to the `table` dictionary in the given code snippet, the initial state of the strings `word`, `b`, and `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`word` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, and strings `b` and `c` are also strings consisting of lowercase English letters; `table` is a dictionary that maps keys to integers with a default value of 0.**
