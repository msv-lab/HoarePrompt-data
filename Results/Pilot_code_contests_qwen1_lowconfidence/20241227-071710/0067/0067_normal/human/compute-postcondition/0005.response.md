According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `word`. The loop condition for the `for` loop is that `char` is the next character in `word`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `b` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `c` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `table` is a dictionary mapping keys to integers with a default value of 0, where `table[char]` is 1.
- `char` is the next character in `word`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in `word`. After processing the current character, `char` will be set to the next character in `word`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `word` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `c` remains the same.
- `table` remains the same.
- `char` will now be the next character in `word`.

State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `table` is a dictionary mapping keys to integers with a default value of 0 where `table[char]` is 1, `char` is the next character in `word`**
