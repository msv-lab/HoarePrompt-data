`char` is extracted from either `word`, `b`, or `c`. The value of `char` is added to the corresponding value in the dictionary `table`. The dictionary `table` maps each character to its count, which is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`word`, `b`, `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `table` is a dictionary mapping keys to integers with a default value of 0, `char` is a character from `word`, `b`, or `c` and the count of `char` in `table` is incremented by 1.**
