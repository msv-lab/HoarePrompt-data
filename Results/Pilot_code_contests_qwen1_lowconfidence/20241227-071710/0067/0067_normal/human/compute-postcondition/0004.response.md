`char` is the next character in `word`. The `table` dictionary maps each key (which includes characters) to an integer value, initially set to 0. The code increases the count of `char` in the `table` dictionary by 1. 

Therefore, the value of `table[char]` is now 1, as it was previously 0 and has been incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`word` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `c` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `table` is a dictionary mapping keys to integers with a default value of 0 where `table[char]` is 1, `char` is the next character in `word`.**
