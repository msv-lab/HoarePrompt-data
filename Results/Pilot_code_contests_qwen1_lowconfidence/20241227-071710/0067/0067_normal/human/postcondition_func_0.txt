The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `word`, which is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. It creates a dictionary `table` that maps each unique character in `word` to its count within `word`. After executing the function, the final state of the program is such that the variable `table` contains this dictionary. The function handles the case where `word` is an empty string by initializing the dictionary with no entries, although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations. There are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
