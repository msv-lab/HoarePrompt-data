The code updates the value of `j` to be `i + 4 * slice_len`. Since `i` and `slice_len` are previously defined and `slice_len` is truthy (non-zero), the value of `j` will be `i + 4 * slice_len`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `win` is False, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`, and `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`.**
