The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only causes the program to exit the loop or the most internal if statement it is inside. In this case, it simply exits the loop or the if statement it is within, without altering the values of `n`, `field`, `slice_len`, `win`, or `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`, `win` is `True`, and `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
