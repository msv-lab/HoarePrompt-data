The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Given the initial state, none of the variables are directly modified by this `break` statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `win` is `True`, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
