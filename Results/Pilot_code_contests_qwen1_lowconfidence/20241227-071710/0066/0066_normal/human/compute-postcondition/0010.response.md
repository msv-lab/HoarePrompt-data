The code `break` does not assign any new values to variables; instead, it breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Given the conditions in the initial state and the presence of the `break` statement, none of the variables (`n`, `field`, `win`, `slice_len`, or `j`) are modified by this statement.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the added detail that the most internal loop or conditional statement is broken.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `win` is `True`, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`, and `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`. The condition `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
