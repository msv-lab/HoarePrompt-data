Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
   - \( field \) is the input string provided by the user.
   - \( win \) is either `True` or `False` based on the condition `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'` where \( j = i + 4 \times \text{slice\_len} \) and \(\text{slice\_len}\) is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must hold true.

3. **Key Variables to Update:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` should be `n-1`.

4. **Update the `win` Variable:**
   - The variable `win` is updated based on the condition involving `j` and `slice_len`. Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, we need to ensure that the condition `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'` holds true for `i = n-1`.
   - Here, `j = (n-1) + 4 \times \text{slice\_len}`. Thus, the condition becomes `(n-1) + 4 \times \text{slice\_len} + \text{slice\_len} \geq n` or `field[(n-1) + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'`.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - If the condition is true, `win` will be set to `True`.
   - Otherwise, `win` will remain unchanged (`False`).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- \( n \) remains the same.
- \( i \) should be \( n-1 \).
- \( field \) remains the same.
- \( win \) will be updated based on the condition described above.

So, the final state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `field` is the input string provided by the user, and `win` is either `True` or `False` based on the condition \((n-1) + 5 \times \text{slice\_len} + \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[(n-1) + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'` where \(\text{slice\_len}\) is the return value of `func_1(field, n-1)`. If the condition is true, `win` is set to `True`; otherwise, `win` remains unchanged.**
