Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`, and `win` remains unchanged (either `True` or unchanged from the precondition if it was not `True`). If `field[i] != '.'`, the execution either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when \(j + slice_len \geq n\) or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, where `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`. Otherwise, the program continues without any change to `win`.***
