The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to work with an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a string `field` consisting of '*' and '.' representing the scheme of the level, where '*' denotes a platform and '.' denotes a pit.

However, since the function definition does not include any parameters in the given code snippet, we need to focus on the output cases provided.

Case_1: The function processes the integer `n` and the string `field` according to the specified conditions.
Case_2: Based on the value of `n` and the content of `field`, the function returns a specific result.

Given the constraints and the lack of a parameter list, we can only describe the expected inputs and outputs in terms of the internal processing described in the problem statement.
