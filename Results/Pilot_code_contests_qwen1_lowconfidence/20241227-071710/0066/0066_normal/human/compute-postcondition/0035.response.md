Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, and `win` is `True` if there exists an index `i` where `field[i] != '.'` and either \(i + 4 \times \text{slice\_len} + \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[i + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'`, otherwise `win` remains `False`. If `win` is `True`, the condition is maintained. If `win` is `False`, it remains `False`.**
