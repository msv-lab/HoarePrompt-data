Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, and `win` is either `True` or remains `False` depending on whether the condition `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'` is met where `j = i + 4 * slice_len` and `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`. If the condition is true, `win` is set to `True`; otherwise, `win` remains unchanged.***
