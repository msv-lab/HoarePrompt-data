Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`, `win` remains unchanged (either `True` or unchanged from the precondition if it was not `True`), and `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`. If `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
