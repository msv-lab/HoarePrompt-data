`win` is assigned the value `True`. The conditions involving `j`, `n`, `field`, and `slice_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `win` is `True`, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`, and `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`. The condition `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'` is true.
