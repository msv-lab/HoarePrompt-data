The function `func_1(field, i)` is called, which likely returns a length of a slice from the string `field` starting at index `i`. However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `slice_len`. But we know that `slice_len` will be assigned the return value of `func_1(field, i)`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `win` is False, and `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`**
