Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `win` is either `True` or remains `False`, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`, and `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`. If the condition `j + slice_len >= n` or `field[j + slice_len] == '*'` is true, then `win` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `win` remains unchanged.***
