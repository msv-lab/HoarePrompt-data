According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `n` is greater than 0. The initial state provides that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). This range ensures that `n` is always greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

However, we also need to consider the variables `field` and `win`. Since the loop body is omitted, there's no direct interaction with `field` or `win` within the loop, but we still need to specify their states to fully describe the initial conditions.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted (or more precisely, described) for the loop to execute are:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `field` is the input string provided by the user
- `win` is False

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `win` is False**
