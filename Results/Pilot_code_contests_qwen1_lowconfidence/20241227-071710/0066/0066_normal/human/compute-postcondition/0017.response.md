The line `win = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `win`. This changes the value of `win` from its previous state based on the condition \((n-1) + 5 \times \text{slice\_len} + \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[(n-1) + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'`, to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `win` is `True`, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`, `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`**
