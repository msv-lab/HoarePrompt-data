The function `func_1(field, i)` is called, which returns the value of `slice_len`. This function's behavior is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact value of `slice_len`. However, we know that `slice_len` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`. The values of `n` and `field` remain unchanged. The variable `win` also remains unchanged unless the new condition for `win` is met, which is not applicable here since no further logic to check this condition is given.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`, and `win` remains unchanged.**
