`win` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `field`, `slice_len`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state with `win` now set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`, `win` is `True`, and `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`.**
