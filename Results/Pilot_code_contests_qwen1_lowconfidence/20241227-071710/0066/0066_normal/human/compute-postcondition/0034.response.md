The code prints 'no', but this does not assign any new values to the variables. The variables `n`, `field`, and `win` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, and `win` remains `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, and `win` remains `False`.**
