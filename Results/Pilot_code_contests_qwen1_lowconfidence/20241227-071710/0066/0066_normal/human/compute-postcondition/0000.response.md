`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. The input is expected to be an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. The value of `field` remains unchanged as the input is only reading an integer value into `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `field` is a string consisting of '*' and '.' representing the scheme of the level**.
