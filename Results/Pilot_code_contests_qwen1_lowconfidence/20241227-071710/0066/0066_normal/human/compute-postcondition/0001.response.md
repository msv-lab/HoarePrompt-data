The code `field = raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `field`. This means that the value of `field` is now whatever the user inputs, and the value of `n` remains unchanged since no assignment or operation was performed on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `field` is the input string provided by the user**
