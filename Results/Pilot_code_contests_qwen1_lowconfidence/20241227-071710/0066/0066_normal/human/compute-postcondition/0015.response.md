The code `slice_len = func_1(field, i)` assigns the value returned by `func_1(field, i)` to `slice_len`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact value of `slice_len`. However, the function `func_1` takes `field` and `i` as inputs and returns an integer. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value either.

The condition to update `win` is based on \((n-1) + 5 \times \text{slice\_len} + \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or \(\text{field}[(n-1) + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'\). Since `slice_len` is updated but `win` remains unchanged unless the condition is met, the state of `win` from the initial state is preserved unless the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `win` is either `True` or `False` based on the condition \((n-1) + 5 \times \text{slice\_len} + \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[(n-1) + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'` where \(\text{slice\_len}\) is the return value of `func_1(field, i-1)`, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`.**
