According to the given code, the loop condition is based on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `field` is the input string provided by the user
- `win` is `True` if \(i + 5 \times \text{slice\_len} + \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or if \(\text{field}[i + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'\). Otherwise, `win` remains unchanged. Here, `slice_len` is the return value of `func_1(field, i)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue if \(i < n\).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
   - `field` is the input string provided by the user
   - `win` is `True` under certain conditions (as described)

2. **Incrementing `i`:**
   - `i` must be incremented by 1.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `field` is the input string provided by the user
- `win` remains unchanged unless the new condition for `win` is met (i.e., \(i + 6 \times \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or \(\text{field}[i + 6 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'\))

The updated state is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, and `win` remains unchanged unless the new condition for `win` is met (i.e., \(i + 6 \times \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or \(\text{field}[i + 6 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'\))**
