The code `j = i + 4 * slice_len` assigns the value of `i + 4 * slice_len` to `j`. The values of `n`, `field`, `slice_len`, and `win` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `j` is assigned the value `i + 4 * slice_len`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `field` is the input string provided by the user.
- `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`.
- `win` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, `slice_len` is the value returned by `func_1(field, i)`, `win` remains unchanged, and `j` is `i + 4 * slice_len`.**
