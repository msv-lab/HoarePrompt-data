Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic to check if a level is "good" according to the problem description. The function `func_2` checks for a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals, but it only checks starting from indices where the character is not a pit ('.') and stops after finding one valid sequence of four jumps. This means it may miss valid sequences starting from different indices.

For example, consider the input:
```
16
.**.*..*.***.**
```
The correct answer should be "yes" because there is a sequence of five platforms at positions 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14. However, the code only checks starting from indices where the character is not a pit, which in this case are indices 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. It finds a valid sequence starting from index 10 (platforms at positions 10, 14, 18, and 22, but the code does not check beyond the end of the level).

To fix this, the code should iterate over all possible starting indices and check for sequences of five platforms with equal intervals. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(field, i):
    for slice_len in range(1, len(field) // 4 + 1):
        if i + 4 * slice_len < len(field):
            res = field[i:i + 5 * slice_len:slice_len]
            if res.count('*') == 5:
                return slice_len
    return None

def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    win = False
    for i in range(n):
        if field[i] != '.':
            slice_len = func_1(field, i)
            if slice_len:
                win = True
                break
    if win:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
```

This corrected version ensures that the function `func_1` checks all possible starting indices and `func_2` correctly checks for sequences of five platforms with equal intervals.
