Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a level is "good" according to the problem description. It checks for a sequence of five platforms where the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if starting from index `i`, there exists a sequence of five platforms such that the interval between consecutive platforms is `slice_len`. It returns the slice length if found, otherwise, it returns 0.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input and iterates through each possible starting platform. For each starting platform, it calls `func_1` to find the jump length. If a valid sequence of five platforms is found, it prints "yes" and breaks out of the loop. If no such sequence is found after checking all possible starting points, it prints "no".

Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles various cases, including edge cases like very short levels or levels with few platforms. The program correctly identifies whether a level is "good" based on the requirement of having a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals. Therefore, the program meets the problem description for all potential cases.
