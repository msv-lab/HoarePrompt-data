You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem you will meet the simplified model of game King of Thieves.

In a new ZeptoLab game called "King of Thieves" your aim is to reach a chest with gold by controlling your character, avoiding traps and obstacles on your way.

<image>

An interesting feature of the game is that you can design your own levels that will be available to other players. Let's consider the following simple design of a level.

A dungeon consists of n segments located at a same vertical level, each segment is either a platform that character can stand on, or a pit with a trap that makes player lose if he falls into it. All segments have the same length, platforms on the scheme of the level are represented as '*' and pits are represented as '.'. 

One of things that affects speedrun characteristics of the level is a possibility to perform a series of consecutive jumps of the same length. More formally, when the character is on the platform number i1, he can make a sequence of jumps through the platforms i1 < i2 < ... < ik, if i2 - i1 = i3 - i2 = ... = ik - ik - 1. Of course, all segments i1, i2, ... ik should be exactly the platforms, not pits. 

Let's call a level to be good if you can perform a sequence of four jumps of the same length or in the other words there must be a sequence i1, i2, ..., i5, consisting of five platforms so that the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Given the scheme of the level, check if it is good.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of segments on the level.

Next line contains the scheme of the level represented as a string of n characters '*' and '.'.

Output

If the level is good, print the word "yes" (without the quotes), otherwise print the word "no" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

16
.**.*..*.***.**.


Output

yes

Input

11
.*.*...*.*.


Output

no

Note

In the first sample test you may perform a sequence of jumps through platforms 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.
Program:
```
from __future__ import print_function
#Function 1:
def func_1(field, i):
    for slice_len in xrange(1, len(field) + 1):
        res = field[i::slice_len]
        if len(res) == 5 and set(res) == {'*'}:
            return slice_len
    return 0

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    n = int(raw_input())
    field = raw_input()
    win = False
    for i in xrange(n):
        if field[i] != '.':
            slice_len = func_1(field, i)
            if slice_len:
                j = i + 4 * slice_len
                if j + slice_len >= n or field[j + slice_len] == '*':
                    win = True
                    break
    if win:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a level is "good" according to the problem description. It checks for a sequence of five platforms where the intervals between consecutive platforms are of the same length. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if starting from index `i`, there exists a sequence of five platforms such that the interval between consecutive platforms is `slice_len`. It returns the slice length if found, otherwise, it returns 0.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input and iterates through each possible starting platform. For each starting platform, it calls `func_1` to find the jump length. If a valid sequence of five platforms is found, it prints "yes" and breaks out of the loop. If no such sequence is found after checking all possible starting points, it prints "no".

Given the constraints and examples provided, the program handles various cases, including edge cases like very short levels or levels with few platforms. The program correctly identifies whether a level is "good" based on the requirement of having a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals. Therefore, the program meets the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from __future__ import print_function

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: field is a string consisting of '*' and '.', and i is an integer such that 0 <= i < len(field).
def func_1(field, i):
    for slice_len in xrange(1, len(field) + 1):
        res = field[i::slice_len]
        
        if len(res) == 5 and set(res) == {'*'}:
            return slice_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `field` is a string consisting of '*' and '.', `i` is undefined, `slice_len` is either `len(field) + 1` or less than `len(field)`, `res` is a slice of `field` starting from an undefined index `i` with a step of `slice_len`. If there exists any slice of `field` starting from any index with a step of `slice_len` such that the length of the slice is 5 and all elements in the slice are '*', the function returns the corresponding `slice_len`. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.
    return 0
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `field` consisting of '*' and '.' characters and an integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < \text{len}(field)\). It aims to find a slice length (`slice_len`) that meets specific conditions. Specifically:

- It iterates through possible slice lengths from 1 to the length of `field`.
- For each slice length, it extracts a substring `res` from `field` starting at index `i` with the current slice length.
- If `res` has a length of 5 and consists entirely of '*', it returns the current slice length.
- If no such slice is found, the function returns `None`.

The potential edge cases include:
- If `field` is empty or `i` is out of bounds, the function will still follow the same logic but will not find a valid `res` substring, leading to a return value of `None`.
- If the first condition (`len(res) == 5 and set(res) == {'*'}`) is met, the function will immediately return the slice length, which means the subsequent conditions (`slice_len_current + 1` and `slice_len_current + 2`) will not be checked.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and field is a string consisting of '*' and '.' representing the scheme of the level, where '*' denotes a platform and '.' denotes a pit.
def func_2():
    n = int(raw_input())
    field = raw_input()
    win = False
    for i in xrange(n):
        if field[i] != '.':
            slice_len = func_1(field, i)
            if slice_len:
                j = i + 4 * slice_len
                if j + slice_len >= n or field[j + slice_len] == '*':
                    win = True
                    break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, and `win` is `True` if there exists an index `i` where `field[i] != '.'` and either \(i + 4 \times \text{slice\_len} + \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[i + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'`, otherwise `win` remains `False`.
    if win :
        print('yes')
    else :
        print('no')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `field` is the input string provided by the user, and `win` is `True` if there exists an index `i` where `field[i] != '.'` and either \(i + 4 \times \text{slice\_len} + \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[i + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'`, otherwise `win` remains `False`. If `win` is `True`, the condition is maintained. If `win` is `False`, it remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and a string `field` consisting of '*' and '.', determining whether there exists an index `i` where `field[i] != '.'` and either \(i + 5 \times \text{slice\_len} \geq n\) or `field[i + 5 \times \text{slice\_len}] == '*'`. The function then prints 'yes' if a winning condition is found (i.e., `win` is `True`), and 'no' otherwise. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no valid index `i` is found within the specified constraints, which results in `win` remaining `False` by default. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `field`.
