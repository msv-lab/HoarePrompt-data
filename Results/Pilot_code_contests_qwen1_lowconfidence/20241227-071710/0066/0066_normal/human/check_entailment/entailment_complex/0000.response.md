Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the level consists of fewer than 5 platforms. According to the problem description, a level is considered "good" if there exists a sequence of five platforms with equal intervals between them. However, the provided code does not check for the minimum requirement of having at least 5 platforms. This can be seen from the following points:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks for sequences of 5 platforms starting from a given index `i` and returns the slice length if found. However, it does not ensure that there are at least 5 platforms in total.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function iterates over all possible starting indices `i` and uses `func_1` to find a valid sequence of 5 platforms. It then checks if the fifth platform is reachable, but it does not validate that there are at least 5 platforms in the level initially.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
Input:
5
*****
```
This input should be considered a valid level according to the problem description, as it contains 5 platforms. However, the provided code would not detect this case correctly because it does not explicitly check for the presence of at least 5 platforms before attempting to find a sequence of 5 platforms.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
