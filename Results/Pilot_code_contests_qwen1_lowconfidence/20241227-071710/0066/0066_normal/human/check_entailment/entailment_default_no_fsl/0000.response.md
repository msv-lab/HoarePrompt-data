Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a level is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` returns `None` if no valid slice is found, but the main function `func_2` expects `slice_len` to be a non-zero integer to proceed with checking the winning condition. This leads to an issue where the code might incorrectly determine that a level is not "good" even if a valid sequence of five platforms exists.

For example, consider the input:

```
16
.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*
```

In this case, there is a valid sequence of five platforms (e.g., 2, 6, 10, 14), but the code will not find it because `func_1` returns `None` for all possible slice lengths, leading to `win` remaining `False`. Therefore, the code will print "no", which is incorrect.

To fix this, the main function `func_2` should change its logic to handle the case where `func_1` returns `None` properly. One possible solution is to modify `func_2` to continue searching for another valid slice length after finding a non-zero result from `func_1`. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, making the code incorrect for some cases.
