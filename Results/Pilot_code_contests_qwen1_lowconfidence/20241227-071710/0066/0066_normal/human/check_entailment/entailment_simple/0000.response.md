Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program accepts an integer `n` (the number of segments) and a string `field` representing the layout of the level.
   - It correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks for sequences of four equal-length jumps starting from any index `i`.
   - It iterates over possible jump lengths (`slice_len`) from 1 to `n`.
   - For each `slice_len`, it checks if there is a subsequence of length 5 consisting entirely of platforms (`'*'`).
   - If such a sequence is found, it returns the jump length; otherwise, it returns 0.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function orchestrates the overall logic.
   - It reads the number of segments `n` and the layout string `field`.
   - It iterates over each segment index `i`.
   - For each non-pit (`'.'`) segment, it calls `func_1` to find a valid jump length.
   - If a valid jump length is found, it checks if the next two segments (after 4 jumps) are also platforms.
   - If both conditions are met, it sets `win` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, it prints 'yes' if `win` is `True`, indicating a valid level; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

Given these points, the program correctly identifies whether the level allows for a sequence of four equal-length jumps of the same length, which is the essence of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
