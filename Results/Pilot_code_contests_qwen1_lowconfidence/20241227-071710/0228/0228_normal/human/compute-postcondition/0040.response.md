The function `func` accepts five parameters: `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is an integer with specific constraints: 1 ≤ `vp`, `vd` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `t`, `f` ≤ 10, and 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000. 

The function has two cases for its output:
Case_1: `number` (which is one of the input parameters) is an integer. If any of the parameters violate their constraints (i.e., `vp`, `vd` are not between 1 and 100, `t` or `f` are not between 1 and 10, or `c` is not between 1 and 1000), the function returns an error message indicating that the parameters are out of range.
Case_2: The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned here, but given the structure, it seems no further action is specified beyond checking the constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept five integer parameters `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c` and return an error message if any of the parameters do not meet their specified constraints. If all parameters meet the constraints, the function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given output.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`, and returns an error message if any parameter is out of its specified range.**
