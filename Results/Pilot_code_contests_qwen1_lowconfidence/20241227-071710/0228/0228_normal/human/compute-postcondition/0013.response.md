Postcondition: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` has a value that is greater than `t_read`; `dl` is increased by `vd`. The current value of `dl` is greater than or equal to `pl` and `pl + vp` is less than or equal to `c`.**
