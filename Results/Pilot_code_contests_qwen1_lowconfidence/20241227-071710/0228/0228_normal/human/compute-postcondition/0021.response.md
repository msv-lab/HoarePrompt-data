The code updates `pl` by adding `vp` to it. Since `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`, and `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`, the value of `pl` is increased by `vp`. The variable `c` remains unchanged, and `t` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` is incremented by 1.**
