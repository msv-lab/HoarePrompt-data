Postcondition: ***`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp + (2 * (pl / vd) + f) * vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` is incremented by 1; `dl` is equal to `pl` or unchanged; `count` is increased by 1 if the condition `dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c` is met.*** 

Since there is no else part in the code, the overall postcondition is directly derived from the if part.
