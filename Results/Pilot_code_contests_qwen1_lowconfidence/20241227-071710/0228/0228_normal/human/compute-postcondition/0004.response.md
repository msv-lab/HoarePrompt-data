`c` is reassigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. The previous value of `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000. The values of `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, `c`, and `t_read` are updated as follows: `vp` remains the integer obtained from `int(raw_input())`, `vd` remains the integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10, `f` remains the integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `c` is reassigned to the new integer value entered via `raw_input()`, and `t_read` remains the value entered using `raw_input()` and converted to an integer.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())`, `vd` is an integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `c` is the new integer value entered via `raw_input()`, and `t_read` is the value entered using `raw_input()` and converted to an integer.**
