`t_read` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. The value of `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())`, `vd` is an integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `t_read` is the value entered using `raw_input()` and converted to an integer.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())`, `vd` is an integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `t_read` is the value entered using `raw_input()` and converted to an integer.**
