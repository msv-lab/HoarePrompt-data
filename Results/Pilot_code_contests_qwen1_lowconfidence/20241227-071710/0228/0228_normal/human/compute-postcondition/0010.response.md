`pl` is assigned the value `pl + vp`. Since `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and must satisfy `vp <= c`, the value of `vp` is known and the value of `pl` is updated accordingly. The state of `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and must satisfy `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged.**
