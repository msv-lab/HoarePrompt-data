Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + (2 * (pl / vd) + f) * vp` or unchanged; `c` remains unchanged; `t` is incremented by the number of iterations; `dl` is equal to `pl` if `dl >= pl` and `pl + vp <= c` is true, otherwise `dl` remains unchanged; `count` is incremented by 1 if the condition `dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c` is met, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.**
