`t` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `t` was `t + 1`, so now `t` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp + (2 * (pl / vd) + f) * vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` is `t + 1`; `dl` is equal to `pl` or unchanged; `count` is increased by 1 if the condition `dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c` is met.**
