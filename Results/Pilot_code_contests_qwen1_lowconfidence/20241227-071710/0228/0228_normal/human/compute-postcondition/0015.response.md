The code sets `dl` to the value of `pl`. Given the initial state:

- `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`
- `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`
- `c` remains unchanged
- `t` has a value that is greater than `t_read`
- `dl` is increased by `vd`
- `count` is increased by 1

After executing the line `dl = pl`, the value of `dl` changes to the current value of `pl`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` has a value that is greater than `t_read`; `dl` is increased by `vd` and equals `pl`; `count` is increased by 1.**
