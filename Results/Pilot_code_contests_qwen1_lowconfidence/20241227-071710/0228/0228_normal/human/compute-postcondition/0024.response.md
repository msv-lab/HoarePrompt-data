The code `dl = pl` assigns the current value of `pl` to `dl`. Based on the initial state, `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`, `c` remains unchanged, `t` is incremented by 1, `dl` is updated to `dl + vd`, and `count` is increased by 1. After these updates, `dl` gets the value of `pl`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`
- `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`
- `c` remains unchanged
- `t` is incremented by 1
- `dl` is updated to `dl + vd` and now also equals `pl`
- `count` is increased by 1

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` is incremented by 1; `dl` is updated to `dl + vd` and now also equals `pl`; `count` is increased by 1**
