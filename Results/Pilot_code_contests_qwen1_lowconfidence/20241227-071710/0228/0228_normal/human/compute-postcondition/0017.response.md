Postcondition: ***`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` has a value that is greater than `t_read`; `dl` is increased by `vd`. If `dl >= pl` and `pl + vp <= c`, then `pl` is further updated to `pl + (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp` and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if-else block executes.***
