The code `f = int(raw_input())` assigns the value of the integer entered via `raw_input()` to the variable `f`. The value of `f` is now an integer input from the user, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())`, `vd` is an integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `t_read` is the value entered using `raw_input()` and converted to an integer.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())`, `vd` is an integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `t_read` is the value entered using `raw_input()` and converted to an integer.**
