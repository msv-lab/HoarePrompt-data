`dl` is incremented by `vd`. The value of `vd` is known, but the exact value of `dl` before the increment is not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and must satisfy `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` has a value that is greater than `t_read`; `dl` is increased by `vd`.**
