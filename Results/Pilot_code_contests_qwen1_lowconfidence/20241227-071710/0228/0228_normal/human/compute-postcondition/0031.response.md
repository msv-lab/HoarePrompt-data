`dl` is incremented by `vd`. The value of `pl` is updated to `pl + vp` and is also constrained by `pl + c <= c`. Since `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`, the value of `pl` is adjusted accordingly. However, the exact value of `pl` is not specified in the initial state, so we keep it as `pl + vp`. The value of `vd` remains unchanged, and `c` is also unchanged.

The code does not affect the constraints or the values of `vp` and `c`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`; `pl` is `pl + vp`; `pl + c <= c`; `dl` is increased by `vd`.**
