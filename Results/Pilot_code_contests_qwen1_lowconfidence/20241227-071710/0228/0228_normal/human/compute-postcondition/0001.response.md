The code `vd = int(raw_input())` updates the value of `vd` by taking an input and converting it to an integer. The original values of `vp`, `t`, `f`, and `c` remain unchanged. Since `raw_input()` takes user input, the new value of `vd` will be the integer input by the user.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())`, `vd` is an integer obtained from `raw_input()`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000.**
