`vp` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())`, `vd` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10, and `c` is an integer between 1 and 1000.**
