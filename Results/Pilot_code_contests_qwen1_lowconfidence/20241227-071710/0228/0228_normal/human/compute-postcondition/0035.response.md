Postcondition: ***`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + (2 * (pl / vd) + f) * vp`; `pl + c <= c`; `dl` is increased by `vd` and equals `pl`; `count` is incremented by 1, provided that `dl >= pl` and `pl + vp <= c`. Otherwise, the values of `pl`, `dl`, and `count` remain unchanged.***
