`t` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions. Therefore, the updated state is: `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` is now `t + 1`; if `t > t_read`, then `dl` is increased by `vd`. If `dl >= pl` and `pl + vp <= c`, `pl` is further updated to `pl + (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp` and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if-else block executes.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` is `t + 1`; if `t > t_read`, then `dl` is increased by `vd`; if `dl >= pl` and `pl + vp <= c`, `pl` is further updated to `pl + (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp` and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if-else block executes.**
