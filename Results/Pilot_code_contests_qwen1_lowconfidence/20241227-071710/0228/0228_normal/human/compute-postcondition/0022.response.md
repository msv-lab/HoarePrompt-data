`dl` is assigned the value of `dl + vd`. The value of `vd` is not specified in the initial state, so we keep it as `vd`. The other variables (`vp`, `pl`, `c`, and `t`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` is incremented by 1; `dl` is updated to `dl + vd`.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `vp <= c`; `pl` is updated to `pl + vp`; `c` remains unchanged; `t` is incremented by 1; `dl` is updated to `dl + vd`**
