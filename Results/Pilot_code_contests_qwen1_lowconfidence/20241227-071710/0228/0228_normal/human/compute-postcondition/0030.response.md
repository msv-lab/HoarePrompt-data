`pl` is incremented by the value of `vp`. Since `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`, and `pl + c <= c` before the update, the updated condition after the increment would be `pl + c <= c - vp`. However, since `pl + c <= c` was true before the update, adding `vp` (which is between 0 and `c`) to `pl` cannot violate this condition because `vp` is non-negative. Therefore, the condition `pl + c <= c` remains valid.

The output state is: `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`; `pl` is `pl + vp`; `pl + c <= c`.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`; `pl` is `pl + vp`; `pl + c <= c`**
