`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`; `pl` is `pl + vp`; `pl + c <= c`; `dl` is increased by `vd`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`; `pl` is `pl + vp`; `pl + c <= c`; `dl` is increased by `vd`; `count` is incremented by 1**
