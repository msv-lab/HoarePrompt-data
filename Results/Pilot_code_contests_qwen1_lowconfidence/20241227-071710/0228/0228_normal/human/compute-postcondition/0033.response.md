`dl` is assigned the value of `pl`. From the initial state, `pl` is `pl + vp`, and `pl + c <= c` implies that `pl` is at most `c - vp`. Also, `dl` is increased by `vd`, and `count` is incremented by 1.

After the code execution, the updated values are:
- `dl` is now equal to `pl`.
- `count` is incremented by 1, so `count` is now `count + 1`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`vp` is an integer obtained from `int(raw_input())` and satisfies `0 <= vp <= c`; `pl` is `pl + vp`; `pl + c <= c`; `dl` is increased by `vd` and equals `pl`; `count` is incremented by 1**
