Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the dragon overtakes the princess exactly at the castle. According to the problem description, if the dragon overtakes the princess at exactly the same moment she has reached the castle, we assume that she reached the castle before the dragon reached her, and doesn't need an extra bijou to hold him off. However, the current implementation always increments the count of bijous even in this scenario.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2
1
1
10
```

According to the problem description, the correct output should be `2`, as explained in the example. However, the program incorrectly outputs `3` because it increments the count even though the princess reaches the castle without needing an extra bijou.

To fix this, the condition where the dragon overtakes the princess at the castle should be handled separately. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    vp = int(input())
    vd = int(input())
    t_read = int(input())
    f = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    pl = 0
    dl = 0
    t = 1
    count = 0
    while pl + vp <= c:
        pl += vp
        if t > t_read:
            dl += vd
            if dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c:
                count += 1
                dl = pl
                pl += (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp
        t += 1
        # Check if the princess has reached the castle
        if pl == c:
            break
    # Check if the dragon has reached the castle
    if dl >= c:
        count -= 1  # Subtract the last unnecessary bijou
    print(count)
```

With this correction, the program will now handle the edge case correctly and produce the expected output.
