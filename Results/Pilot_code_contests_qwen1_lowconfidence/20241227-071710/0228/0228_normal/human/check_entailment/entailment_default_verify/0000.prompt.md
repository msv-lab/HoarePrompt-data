You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The princess is going to escape the dragon's cave, and she needs to plan it carefully.

The princess runs at vp miles per hour, and the dragon flies at vd miles per hour. The dragon will discover the escape after t hours and will chase the princess immediately. Looks like there's no chance to success, but the princess noticed that the dragon is very greedy and not too smart. To delay him, the princess decides to borrow a couple of bijous from his treasury. Once the dragon overtakes the princess, she will drop one bijou to distract him. In this case he will stop, pick up the item, return to the cave and spend f hours to straighten the things out in the treasury. Only after this will he resume the chase again from the very beginning.

The princess is going to run on the straight. The distance between the cave and the king's castle she's aiming for is c miles. How many bijous will she need to take from the treasury to be able to reach the castle? If the dragon overtakes the princess at exactly the same moment she has reached the castle, we assume that she reached the castle before the dragon reached her, and doesn't need an extra bijou to hold him off.

Input

The input data contains integers vp, vd, t, f and c, one per line (1 ≤ vp, vd ≤ 100, 1 ≤ t, f ≤ 10, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000).

Output

Output the minimal number of bijous required for the escape to succeed.

Note

In the first case one hour after the escape the dragon will discover it, and the princess will be 1 mile away from the cave. In two hours the dragon will overtake the princess 2 miles away from the cave, and she will need to drop the first bijou. Return to the cave and fixing the treasury will take the dragon two more hours; meanwhile the princess will be 4 miles away from the cave. Next time the dragon will overtake the princess 8 miles away from the cave, and she will need the second bijou, but after this she will reach the castle without any further trouble.

The second case is similar to the first one, but the second time the dragon overtakes the princess when she has reached the castle, and she won't need the second bijou.
Program:
```
def func():
    vp = int(raw_input())
    vd = int(raw_input())
    t_read = int(raw_input())
    f = int(raw_input())
    c = int(raw_input())
    pl = 0
    dl = 0
    t = 1
    count = 0
    while pl + vp <= c:
        pl += vp
        if t > t_read:
            dl += vd
            if dl >= pl and pl + vp <= c:
                count += 1
                dl = pl
                pl += (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp
        t += 1
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of bijous needed for the princess to escape. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program initializes `pl` (princess's position) and `dl` (dragon's position) to 0 and starts a loop where it increments the positions of the princess and the dragon.
2. The loop continues until the princess reaches or exceeds the castle distance `c`.
3. When the dragon overtakes the princess (`dl >= pl`), the program increments the bijou count and adjusts the positions accordingly.

However, the logic for adjusting the positions after the dragon overtakes the princess seems flawed. Specifically, the line:
```python
pl += (2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp
```
This line attempts to account for the time the dragon spends returning to the cave and fixing the treasury, but it does not correctly reflect the princess's movement during this period. The princess should continue running towards the castle while the dragon is occupied, but the current logic does not properly account for this.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:
- Suppose \(vp = 1\), \(vd = 2\), \(t = 1\), \(f = 1\), and \(c = 10\).
- After 1 hour, the dragon will discover the escape and start chasing.
- In 2 hours, the dragon will overtake the princess at 2 miles away from the cave. The princess will need to drop the first bijou, and the dragon will return to the cave and spend 1 hour fixing.
- During this 1 hour, the princess will cover 1 mile (since \(vp = 1\)).
- Now, the dragon resumes the chase from the cave. He will overtake the princess again at 4 miles from the cave. The princess will need the second bijou.
- The program should account for the princess continuing to run while the dragon is occupied, but it does not do so correctly.

Therefore, the program does not handle the case where the princess continues running while the dragon is busy, leading to incorrect calculations of the number of bijous needed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func()` accepts five integer parameters `vp`, `vd`, `t`, `f`, and `c`. It reads `vp` and `vd` from user input, where `1 ≤ vp, vd ≤ 100`. The variable `t` is read as `t_read` and `1 ≤ t_read ≤ 10`. The parameters `f` and `c` are also read from user input, where `1 ≤ f, c ≤ 1000`. The function then iterates through a loop until `pl + vp > c`, updating `pl` and `dl` based on certain conditions. Inside the loop, `pl` is incremented by `vp`, and if `t > t_read`, `dl` is updated to `pl` and `pl` is further incremented by `(2 * (dl / vd) + f) * vp`. The loop increments `t` and `count` is incremented when `dl >= pl` and `pl + vp <= c` is true. After the loop, the function prints the value of `count`, which represents the number of times the condition `dl >= pl` and `pl + vp <= c` was met during the loop iterations. If any of the initial parameters are out of their specified ranges, the function will raise an error.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
