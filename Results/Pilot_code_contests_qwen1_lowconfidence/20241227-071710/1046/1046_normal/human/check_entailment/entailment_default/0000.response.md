Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The function `func_1` reads the input correctly. It parses the integer `n` and the list `P` and yields the required tuple `(n, P)`. This ensures that the input is processed as expected.

2. **Dynamic Programming Solution**: The function `func_2` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of portal jumps required to start off at room `i` with an odd number of crosses and get back to room `i` with an even number of crosses. The recurrence relation used is:
   \[
   dp[i] = 1 + \sum_{j = p(i)}^{i-1} (dp[j] + 1)
   \]
   This ensures that the transitions between odd and even counts of crosses are correctly handled.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The operations within the loop are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is necessary as per the problem constraints.

4. **Total Calculation**: The total number of portal jumps required to navigate from room 1 to room `n+1` is calculated by summing up the values in `dp` and adding 1 for the initial jump to the second room.

Given the above points, the code correctly implements the logic and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no identified edge cases or examples where the program does not work as expected.
