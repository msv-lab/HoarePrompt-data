Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem description states that Vasya starts in room 1 and needs to reach room `n+1`. However, the function `func_2` seems to be calculating the number of portal jumps starting from room 0 to room `n` and then adding 1 for the final jump to room `n+1`. This is incorrect because Vasya starts in room 1, not room 0.

To fix this, the function should start the calculations from room 1 and ensure that the logic correctly accounts for Vasya's starting position and the condition of crossing being odd or even. The current implementation of `func_2` would not produce the correct result for the given problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
1 2
```
The correct output should be 4, but due to the starting point issue, the current implementation will not produce this result.
