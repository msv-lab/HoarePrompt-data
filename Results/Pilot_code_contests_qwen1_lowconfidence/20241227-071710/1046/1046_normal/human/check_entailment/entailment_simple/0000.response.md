Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Portal Usage Logic**:
   - The problem description states that Vasya should use the second portal if the room's ceiling contains an odd number of crosses, and the first portal otherwise.
   - However, the `func_2` function does not simulate this logic. Instead, it calculates a series of `dp` values which do not accurately represent the number of portal jumps needed to transition between odd and even cross counts.

2. **DP Array Calculation**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with zeros and then populated using a nested loop. The inner loop iterates over a range from `p[i]` to `i-1`, but this does not correctly model the transitions of cross counts as per the problem description.
   - Specifically, the logic inside the inner loop does not reflect the actual transitions of cross counts or the usage of portals as described.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation in `func_2` sums up the values in the `dp` array and adds `n`. This sum does not represent the number of portal jumps needed to exit the maze according to the problem description.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate Vasya's movements through the maze, keeping track of the number of crosses and deciding which portal to use based on the current count of crosses.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_2(n, p):
    def dfs(room, cross_count, memo):
        if room == n:
            return 0
        if (room, cross_count % 2) in memo:
            return memo[(room, cross_count % 2)]
        
        if cross_count % 2 == 1:
            next_room = p[room]
            return (1 + dfs(next_room, 0, memo)) % (10**9 + 7)
        else:
            next_room = room + 1
            return (1 + dfs(next_room, 1, memo)) % (10**9 + 7)
    
    # Start with the initial state: room 1 and 1 cross
    result = dfs(0, 1, {})
    return result

# Function 1 remains the same
def func_1(line):
    while True:
        n = int(next(line).strip())
        p = [(int(p_i) - 1) for p_i in next(line).split()]
        yield n, p

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    (n, P) = next(func_1(iter(sys.stdin)))
    result = func_2(n, P)
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **DFS with Memoization**: The `dfs` function recursively simulates Vasya's movement through the maze. It takes the current room and the current cross count as arguments and returns the number of portal jumps needed to exit the maze.
- **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we use a dictionary `memo` to store previously computed results for each state (room, cross count).
- **Base Case**: If Vasya is in room `n+1`, return 0 as no more portal jumps are needed.
- **Decision Logic**: Based on the current cross count, decide whether to use the second portal (to room `pi`) or the first portal (to room `i+1`).

This approach ensures that the program correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement.
