Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. Specifically, the main issue lies in how the `dp` array is populated in `func_2`.

According to the problem description, Vasya alternates between using the first and second portals based on whether the current room has an odd or even number of crosses. However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly simulate this behavior.

The formula in the code:
```python
dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j] for j in range(p[i], i)) + 1
```
is attempting to calculate the number of portal jumps required to transition from an odd number of crosses to an even number of crosses, but it does not accurately reflect the problem's logic. 

To correctly simulate the problem, the `dp` array should be used to store the number of jumps required to transition from an odd to an even number of crosses, and vice versa. However, the current implementation sums up `dp[j]` for `j` in the range `[p[i], i-1]`, which does not match the problem's requirement.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the `dp` update logic:
```python
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i == 1:
        dp[i] = 1  # Initial condition: Vasya starts with 1 cross in room 1
    else:
        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (1 if dp[i-1] % 2 == 0 else 0)) % (1000000007)
        dp[i] = (dp[i] + (1 if dp[p[i-1]] % 2 == 1 else 0)) % (1000000007)
```

With this corrected logic, the code should correctly simulate the transitions and compute the required number of portal jumps.

Since the current implementation does not follow the problem description, the program is incorrect.
