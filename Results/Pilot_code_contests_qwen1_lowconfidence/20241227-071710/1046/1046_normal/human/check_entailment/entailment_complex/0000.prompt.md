You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.

The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number pi, where 1 ≤ pi ≤ i.

In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows. 

  * Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1. 
  * Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room pi), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. 



Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) — the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ i). Each pi denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room.

Output

Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an iterator `line` that yields two strings: the first string is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10³), and the second string contains `n` space-separated integers `P` (1 ≤ `P[i]` ≤ `i`). It reads these values and processes them to yield a tuple `(n, P)` where `n` is the integer value of the first line and `P` is a list of integers each being `int(p_i) - 1` where `p_i` is from the split of the second line. The function continues to yield such pairs until there are no more lines to read from `line`. An edge case to consider is when the iterator `line` is exhausted, at which point the function will stop yielding and terminate. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code; however, it is assumed that the iterator `line` provides valid input according to the specified constraints.

    dp[i] is the number of portal jumps required to start off at room i with an odd

    Hence the recurrence relation is as follows:

    This can be read as "the number of portal jumps to get from room i with an odd

It calculates the total number of portal jumps required to navigate through the rooms from room 0 to room `n`, ensuring that the number of crosses changes from odd to even, and prints the result. The final state of the program is that it prints the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of portal jumps needed to change the cross count from odd to even starting from room `i` and returning to room `i` with an even number of crosses. The calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 1 by directly setting `dp[0]` to 1 since no other calculation is needed.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
