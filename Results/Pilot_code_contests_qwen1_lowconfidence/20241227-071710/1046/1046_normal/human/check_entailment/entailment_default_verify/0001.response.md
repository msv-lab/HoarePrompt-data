Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code contains logical errors in the calculation of the `dp` array. Specifically, the formula used in the loop to calculate `portal_jumps` is incorrect. The corrected version of the function `func_2` should properly handle the transitions and ensure that the parity of the number of crosses is correctly managed. The original code incorrectly sums up values without considering the correct transitions and parity changes. Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the number of portal jumps required to navigate through the rooms as per the problem description.
