Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly shows that the program has a logical error in the calculation of `dp[i]`. Specifically, the formula used in the loop to calculate `portal_jumps` is incorrect. The intended recurrence relation should consider the parity of the number of crosses in the current room and correctly update the `dp` array.

The original assessment correctly identified that the formula `dp[i] = 1 + [Sum_{j = p(i)}^{i-1} dp[j] + 1]` is incorrect. It should account for the parity of the number of crosses correctly. The provided annotated version further confirms this issue by showing the incorrect summation and handling of the transitions.

The corrected version of the function `func_2` provided earlier correctly addresses these issues by ensuring that the parity of the number of crosses is properly managed. However, since the original program as provided in the code snippet does not implement the correct logic, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is maintained.
