You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.

The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number pi, where 1 ≤ pi ≤ i.

In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows. 

  * Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1. 
  * Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room pi), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. 



Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) — the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ i). Each pi denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room.

Output

Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description.

1. **Incorrect Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation in `func_2` is incorrect. The relation should account for moving from room `i` to room `p[i]` and then potentially moving back to room `i` with an odd number of crosses. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this logic. Specifically, the sum part of the recurrence relation should not include the current room `i` since we are moving to room `p[i]` and then back to `i`.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation should be applied directly to the sum of `dp[j]` and `1`, not to floating-point numbers. Using `1000000000.0 + 7` instead of `1000000007` is incorrect and unnecessary.

3. **Logic for Moving Between Rooms**: The logic for determining whether to use the first or second portal in each room is not implemented correctly. The program should keep track of the number of crosses and decide which portal to use based on whether the number of crosses is odd or even.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the number of portal jumps to get from room i with an odd number of crosses
        # to an even number of crosses
        portal_jumps = 1
        for j in range(p[i], i):
            portal_jumps = (portal_jumps + dp[j] + 1) % 1000000007
        dp[i] = portal_jumps
    
    # Calculate the total number of portal jumps needed to get to room n+1
    total_pjumps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total_pjumps = (total_pjumps + dp[i]) % 1000000007
    print(total_pjumps)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    for n, p in func_1(sys.stdin):
        func_2(n, p)
```

This corrected version properly implements the logic to determine the number of portal jumps required to get from room 1 to room \( n+1 \) based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
