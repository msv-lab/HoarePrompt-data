Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description.

1. **Incorrect Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation in `func_2` is incorrect. The relation should account for moving from room `i` to room `p[i]` and then potentially moving back to room `i` with an odd number of crosses. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this logic. Specifically, the sum part of the recurrence relation should not include the current room `i` since we are moving to room `p[i]` and then back to `i`.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation should be applied directly to the sum of `dp[j]` and `1`, not to floating-point numbers. Using `1000000000.0 + 7` instead of `1000000007` is incorrect and unnecessary.

3. **Logic for Moving Between Rooms**: The logic for determining whether to use the first or second portal in each room is not implemented correctly. The program should keep track of the number of crosses and decide which portal to use based on whether the number of crosses is odd or even.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the number of portal jumps to get from room i with an odd number of crosses
        # to an even number of crosses
        portal_jumps = 1
        for j in range(p[i], i):
            portal_jumps = (portal_jumps + dp[j] + 1) % 1000000007
        dp[i] = portal_jumps
    
    # Calculate the total number of portal jumps needed to get to room n+1
    total_pjumps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total_pjumps = (total_pjumps + dp[i]) % 1000000007
    print(total_pjumps)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    for n, p in func_1(sys.stdin):
        func_2(n, p)
```

This corrected version properly implements the logic to determine the number of portal jumps required to get from room 1 to room \( n+1 \) based on the problem description.
