You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one.

The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number pi, where 1 ≤ pi ≤ i.

In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows. 

  * Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1. 
  * Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room pi), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal. 



Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 103) — the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ i). Each pi denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room.

Output

Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the calculation of `dp[i]`. Specifically, the formula used in the loop to calculate `portal_jumps` is incorrect. The intended recurrence relation should consider the parity of the number of crosses in the current room and correctly update the `dp` array.

Let's analyze the issue with the provided code:

1. The formula `dp[i] = 1 + [Sum_{j = p(i)}^{i-1} dp[j] + 1]` is incorrect. It should be:
   - If the current room has an odd number of crosses, Vasya will use the second portal to move to room `p[i]`, which means we need to add the value of `dp[p[i]]` to the count.
   - After moving to room `p[i]`, the parity of the number of crosses will change, so we need to add 1 to account for this move.

2. The current implementation incorrectly sums up values without considering the correct transitions and parity changes.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(n, p):
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        # If the current room has an odd number of crosses
        if dp[i] % 2 == 1:
            # Move to room p[i]
            dp[i] += dp[p[i]] + 1
        else:
            # Move to room p[i]
            dp[i] += dp[p[i]] + 1
        # Take modulo to ensure it doesn't exceed the limit
        dp[i] %= 1000000007
    
    total_pjumps = dp[0]
    total_pjumps %= 1000000007
    print(total_pjumps)
```

This corrected version properly handles the transitions and ensures that the parity of the number of crosses is correctly managed. With this fix, the program should work correctly for all cases described in the problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an iterator `line` that yields two strings: the first string is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10³), and the second string contains `n` space-separated integers `P` (1 ≤ `P[i]` ≤ `i`). It reads these values and processes them to yield a tuple `(n, P)` where `n` is the integer value of the first line and `P` is a list of integers each being `int(p_i) - 1` where `p_i` is from the split of the second line. The function continues to yield such pairs until there are no more lines to read from `line`. An edge case to consider is when the iterator `line` is exhausted, at which point the function will stop yielding and terminate. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code; however, it is assumed that the iterator `line` provides valid input according to the specified constraints.

It calculates the total number of portal jumps required to navigate through the rooms from room 0 to room `n`, ensuring that the number of crosses changes from odd to even, and prints the result. The final state of the program is that it prints the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of portal jumps needed to change the cross count from odd to even starting from room `i` and returning to room `i` with an even number of crosses. The calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 1 by directly setting `dp[0]` to 1 since no other calculation is needed.
