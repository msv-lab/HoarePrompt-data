Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The original code contains a logical error in the calculation of `dp[i]`. Specifically, the formula used in the loop to calculate `portal_jumps` is incorrect. The provided annotated version highlights that the current implementation incorrectly sums up values without considering the correct transitions and parity changes. The corrected version of the function `func_2` should properly manage the transitions and ensure that the parity of the number of crosses is correctly handled. Without this correction, the program cannot accurately determine the number of portal jumps required for Vasya to exit the maze as per the problem description.
