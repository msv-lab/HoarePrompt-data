The function `func_1` accepts an iterator `line` that yields two strings: the first string is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10³), and the second string contains `n` space-separated integers `P` (1 ≤ `P[i]` ≤ `i`). It reads these values and processes them to yield a tuple `(n, P)` where `n` is the integer value of the first line and `P` is a list of integers each being `int(p_i) - 1` where `p_i` is from the split of the second line. The function continues to yield such pairs until there are no more lines to read from `line`. An edge case to consider is when the iterator `line` is exhausted, at which point the function will stop yielding and terminate. There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code; however, it is assumed that the iterator `line` provides valid input according to the specified constraints.
