The given code initializes `portal_jumps` to 1. This assignment affects the value of `portal_jumps`. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is 0; `portal_jumps` is 1**
