The code snippet `portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` modifies the value of `portal_jumps`. Given the initial conditions, `j` is equal to `i`, which is `n-1`. We need to find the value of `dp[j]` using the formula `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) % 1000000007`.

Since `i` is `n-1`, `dp[n-1]` is calculated as `(n-1 - p[n-1] + 1) % 1000000007`. The value of `p[n-1]` is less than `n-1`, so let's denote it as `k` where `0 <= k < n-1`. Thus, `dp[n-1] = ((n-1) - k + 1) % 1000000007 = (n - k) % 1000000007`.

Therefore, `portal_jumps` is updated as `portal_jumps += (n - k) % 1000000007`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) % 1000000007`, `i` is `n-1`, `portal_jumps` is `portal_jumps + (n - p[n-1]) % 1000000007`, and `p[n-1]` is less than `n-1`.**
