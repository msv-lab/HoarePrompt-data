The code snippet `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` increments `portal_jumps` by 1 modulo \(1000000007\). Given that `portal_jumps` was initially incremented by `(n - p[n-1]) % 1000000007`, we need to add 1 more to it.

Since the operation is performed modulo \(1000000007\), the value of `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is simply `1`. Thus, `portal_jumps` is incremented by `1`.

Therefore, the updated value of `portal_jumps` is:
\[ portal_jumps = (n - p[n-1] + 1) \% 1000000007 \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`, `i` is `n-1`, `portal_jumps` is `(n - p[n-1] + 1) \% 1000000007`, and `p[n-1]` is less than `n-1`.**
