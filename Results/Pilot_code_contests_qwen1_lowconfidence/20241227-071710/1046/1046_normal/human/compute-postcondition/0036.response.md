Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `p[2]` is 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `portal_jumps` is its previous value plus `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(p[i], i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `p[i]` to `i`.
   - Since `i` is 2, the range is `range(p[2], 2)` which translates to `range(1, 2)`.
   - This means the loop will only run once, iterating from `1` to `1`.

4. **Effect of the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `portal_jumps` is incremented by 1 and then taken modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\).
   - This means that after the loop, `portal_jumps` will be its previous value plus 1, modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\).

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `p[2]` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
   - `i` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it.
   - `portal_jumps` is incremented by 1 and then taken modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\).

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**`p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `portal_jumps` is its previous value plus 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)**.

However, since the loop only runs once and there is no further modification of `p[2]` or `i`, the final state before moving to the next iteration will be:

**`p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `portal_jumps` is (its previous value + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7)**.

So, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:

**`p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `portal_jumps` is (its previous value + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7)**.
