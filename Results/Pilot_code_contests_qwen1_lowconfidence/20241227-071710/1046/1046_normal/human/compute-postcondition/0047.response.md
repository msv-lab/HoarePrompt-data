The code `total_pjumps += dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` updates `total_pjumps` by adding the value of `dp[i]` modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\) to it. Given the initial state:

- `total_pjumps` is \(\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1\)
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0

After executing the code, `total_pjumps` becomes \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1) + (\text{dp}[1] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7))\).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`total_pjumps` is \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1) + (\text{dp}[1] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7))\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
