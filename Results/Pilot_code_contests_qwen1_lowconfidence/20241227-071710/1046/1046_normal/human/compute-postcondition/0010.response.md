Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
   - `p` remains the same: `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\)
   - `dp` remains the same: `dp` is a list of `n` zeros
   - `i` is now 2
   - `portal_jumps` is now 3

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop iterates over `j` in the range from `p[i]` to `i`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 2, so the range for `j` is from `p[2]` to 2.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - For the loop to execute, `p[2]` must be less than or equal to 2.
   - If `p[2]` is 1 or 2, then `j` will iterate from `p[2]` to 2 (inclusive), allowing the loop to execute.

5. **New States After One Iteration:**
   - `i` will remain 2 since it does not change inside the loop.
   - `portal_jumps` will remain 3 since it does not change inside the loop.
   - `n`, `p`, and `dp` will remain the same as they are not modified in the loop.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `p[2]` must be 1 or 2. If `p[2]` is 1, `j` will iterate from 1 to 2; if `p[2]` is 2, `j` will iterate from 2 to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` remains the same: `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` remains the same: `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is now 2; `portal_jumps` is now 3; `p[2]` must be 1 or 2.**
