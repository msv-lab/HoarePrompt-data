Let's go through the steps:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `portal_jumps` is the original value of `portal_jumps` plus `1` mod \(1000000007\).
   - `j` is `p[n-2] + 2` if `p[n-2] + 2 < n-1` or `p[n-2] + 1` if `p[n-2] + 2 == n-1`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)
   ```

   - `portal_jumps` is incremented by `dp[j] % 1000000007`. Here, `1000000000.0 + 7` simplifies to `1000000007` because of the modulo operation.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `portal_jumps` is updated by adding `dp[j] % 1000000007` to its current value.
   - No other variables are affected.

Given the above, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`; `i` is `n-1`; `portal_jumps` is the original value of `portal_jumps` plus `1` mod \(1000000007\) plus `dp[j] % 1000000007`; `j` is `p[n-2] + 2` if `p[n-2] + 2 < n-1` or `p[n-2] + 1` if `p[n-2] + 2 == n-1`.**
