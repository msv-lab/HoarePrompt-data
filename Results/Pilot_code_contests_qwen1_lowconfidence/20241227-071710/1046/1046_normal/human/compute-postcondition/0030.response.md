To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`.
- `i` is `2`.
- `portal_jumps` is `1`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(p[i], i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop is using `i` as the upper bound in the range function.
   - Given `i` is set to `2`, we need to ensure that `i` is a valid index in the list `p` and `dp`.

2. **List `p`:**
   - The value of `p[i]` (which is `p[2]` in this case) must be a valid index within the list `p`.
   - From the constraints, \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\), so \(1 \leq p[2] \leq 2\). Therefore, `p[2]` can only be either `1` or `2`.

3. **Range Function in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `p[i]` to `i-1`.
   - Since `i` is `2`, the loop would iterate from `p[2]` to `1` (i.e., from `1` to `1` if `p[2]` is `1`, or from `2` to `1` if `p[2]` is `2`).

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `p[i]` must be less than `i`.
   - Given `i` is `2`, `p[2]` must be less than `2`.
   - Therefore, `p[2]` must be `1`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The values of `n`, `dp`, and `portal_jumps` do not affect the condition for the loop execution directly.

### Conclusion:
The key state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:
- `p[2]` must be `1` (since `p[2]` must be less than `2` for the loop to execute).

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2**

This ensures that the loop can execute based on the given constraints and the loop condition.
