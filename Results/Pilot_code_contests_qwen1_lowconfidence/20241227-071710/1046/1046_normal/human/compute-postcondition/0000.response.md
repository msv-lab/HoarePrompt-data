Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10³; `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ pi ≤ i for each 0 ≤ i < n; the code prints out the number of times Vasya needs to use portals to get to room n+1 using the given recurrence relation; the recurrence relation is defined as dp[i] = 1 + [Sum_{j = p(i)}^{i-1} dp[j] + 1]**
