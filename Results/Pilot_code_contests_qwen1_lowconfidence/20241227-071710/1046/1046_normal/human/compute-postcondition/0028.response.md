Let's break down the given problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 \)
- \( p \) is a list of \( n \) integers where \( 1 \leq p_i \leq i \) for each \( 0 \leq i < n \)
- \( dp \) is a list of \( n \) integers where \( dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007 \)
- \( i \) is \( 1 \)
- \( portal_jumps \) is the sum of \( dp[j] \) for all \( j \) in the range \( p[i] \) to \( i \) plus \( i - p[i] \) for all such \( j \)
- \( p[i] \) is less than \( i \)
- \( dp[i] \) is updated to \( \text{int}(portal_jumps \% (1000000000.0 + 7)) \)

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - \( i \) is initially set to \( 1 \).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as \( i < n \).

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - \( i = 1 \)
   - \( p \) and \( dp \) are already initialized as per the given conditions.
   - \( portal_jumps \) is computed for \( i = 1 \).
   - \( dp[1] \) is updated based on \( portal_jumps \).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, \( i \) will be incremented by 1, so \( i = 2 \).

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - \( i \) changes from 1 to 2.
   - \( p \) and \( dp \) lists remain the same unless modified within the loop.
   - \( portal_jumps \) needs to be recalculated for the new value of \( i \).
   - \( dp[2] \) will be updated based on the new value of \( portal_jumps \).

### Final State for the Next Iteration:
- \( i \) is now \( 2 \).
- \( p \) and \( dp \) lists remain unchanged.
- \( portal_jumps \) is recalculated for \( i = 2 \).
- \( dp[2] \) is updated based on the new value of \( portal_jumps \).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 \), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq p_i \leq i \) for each \( 0 \leq i < n \), `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`, `i` is `2`, `portal_jumps` is the sum of `dp[j]` for all `j` in the range `p[i]` to `i` plus `i - p[i]` for all such `j`, and `p[i]` is less than `i`. `dp[i]` is updated to `int(portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7))` for the current `i`.**
