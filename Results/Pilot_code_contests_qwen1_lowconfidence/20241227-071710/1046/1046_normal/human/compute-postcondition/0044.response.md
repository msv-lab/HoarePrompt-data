`total_pjumps` is incremented by `dp[i] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `total_pjumps += dp[0] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. The value of `total_pjumps` is updated, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is 0 + dp[0] % (1000000000.0 + 7), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
