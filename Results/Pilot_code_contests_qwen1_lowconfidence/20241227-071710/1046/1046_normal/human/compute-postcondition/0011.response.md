`portal_jumps` is incremented by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Since `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `dp[j]` will be `0` for all `j`, and thus `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` will also be `0`. Therefore, the value of `portal_jumps` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` remains the same: `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` remains the same: `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is now 2; `portal_jumps` is now 3; `p[2]` must be 1 or 2; `portal_jumps` is unchanged.**
