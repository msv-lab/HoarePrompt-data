The initial state sets `n` to an integer between 1 and 10^3, `p` as a list of `n` integers where each element \(p_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\), `dp` as a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) % 1000000007`, `i` to `n-1`, and `portal_jumps` to `(n-1 - p[n-1] + 1) % 1000000007`.

The code snippet assigns the value `1` to `portal_jumps`. This updates the value of `portal_jumps` without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) % 1000000007`; `i` is `n-1`; `portal_jumps` is `1`.**
