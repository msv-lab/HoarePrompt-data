Let's analyze the given loop step by step:

1. **Current States:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\)
   - `dp` is a list of `n` zeros
   - `i` is 1
   - `portal_jumps` is 2
   - `p[0]` is less than 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `p[i]` to `i`.
   - Given `i` is 1, the condition becomes `j` from `p[1]` to 1.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since `p[0]` is less than 1, it implies `p[1]` should be checked to ensure it is a valid index.
   - The condition `p[1] <= 1` must hold true for the loop to execute. 

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The loop will then check if `p[2]` is less than or equal to 2 (since `i` is now 2).

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
   - `p` remains the same: `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\)
   - `dp` remains the same: `dp` is a list of `n` zeros
   - `i` is now 2
   - `portal_jumps` remains the same: 2
   - `p[0]` remains the same: less than 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 2, `portal_jumps` is 2, and `p[0]` is less than 1**.
