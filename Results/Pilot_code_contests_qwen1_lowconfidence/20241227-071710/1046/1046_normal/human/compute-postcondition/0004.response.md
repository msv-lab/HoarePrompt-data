Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `i` is 0.
- `portal_jumps` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(p[i], i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`**: The loop iterates over `j` from `p[i]` to `i` (exclusive). Therefore, `j` should be in the range `[p[i], i)`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is 0.
3. **Value of `p[i]`**: Since `i` is 0, we need to consider the value of `p[0]`. Given the constraints, \(1 \leq p_0 \leq 0\), this condition cannot be satisfied as there is no integer between 1 and 0. However, since `i` is 0, `p[i]` should be checked within the valid range of `p[i]` for the next possible `i`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- For the loop to start, `p[i]` must be less than `i`. Since `i` is currently 0, `p[0]` must be a value that allows the range to be valid. The only possible value for `p[0]` under the given constraints would be invalid (since no number is both >=1 and <=0). However, for the sake of the loop starting, we assume `i` is incremented or `p[i]` changes in subsequent iterations.

Since the initial `i` is 0 and `p[0]` must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq p_0 \leq 0\), this is inherently impossible. But for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `p[i]` is less than `i`.

### Adjusted States:
To allow the loop to execute for the next possible iteration, we need to ensure that `p[i]` is less than `i` for the next value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 1 (to ensure p[i] can be less than i), `portal_jumps` is 1, and `p[i]` is less than `i`**.

However, if we strictly follow the given initial state with `i` being 0, then the state adjustment needed for the loop to potentially execute in the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 1, `portal_jumps` is 1, and `p[0]` is less than 0 (though logically impossible)**.

Since `p[0]` must be less than 0 for the loop to execute in the next iteration, we adjust the state to ensure it can happen in the next iteration:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 1, `portal_jumps` is 1, and `p[0]` is less than 0 (though logically impossible)**.

For practical purposes, we can state that the initial state should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute in the next iteration:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 1, `portal_jumps` is 1, and `p[0]` is less than 1**.

Final State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 1, `portal_jumps` is 1, and `p[0]` is less than 1**.
