`total_pjumps` is initially set to \(0 + \text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7)\). The value of `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. The code `total_pjumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` increments `total_pjumps` by 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Since 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\) is 1, `total_pjumps` is updated to \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7)) + 1\).

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is (\(\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7)\) + 1), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
