Let's break down the requirements for the for loop to execute based on the given state:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` should take on values starting from 0 up to `n-1`.

2. **Initial Values**: We know that `dp` is initialized as a list of zeros, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).

3. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation is defined as \(dp[i] = 1 + \sum_{j=p(i)}^{i-1} dp[j] + 1\). This relation implies that we need to compute `dp[i]` based on previously computed values of `dp[j]` for \(j\) ranging from `p(i)` to `i-1`.

4. **Initialization**: Before entering the loop, we need to ensure that all the necessary initial conditions are set correctly.

Based on these points, let's summarize the required states before the loop starts:

- `n` must be an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` must be a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` must be initialized as a list of `n` zeros.

The loop itself will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` until `i = n-1`. Thus, we need to specify the initial state of `i` as 0 and ensure that the loop can proceed through all iterations correctly.

**State:**
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\)
- `dp` is a list of `n` zeros
- `i` is 0

Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 0**
