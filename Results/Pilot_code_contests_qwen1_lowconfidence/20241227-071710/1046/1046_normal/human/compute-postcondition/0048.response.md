The initial state is:
- `total_pjumps` is \(\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1\)
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0

The code snippet is:
```python
total_pjumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is 1 because the modulo operation with a number larger than 1 will yield the same number.
2. The value of `total_pjumps` is updated by adding 1 to its current value.

Thus, the new value of `total_pjumps` is:
\[ \text{total_pjumps} = (\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1) + 1 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ \text{total_pjumps} = (\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2) \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2)\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
