`portal_jumps` is incremented by 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). The original value of `portal_jumps` is 3. After adding 1, the new value is calculated as \(3 + 1 \mod 1000000007 = 4 \mod 1000000007 = 4\).

Output State: **`n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` remains the same: `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` remains the same: `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is now 2; `portal_jumps` is now 4; `p[2]` must be 1 or 2.**
