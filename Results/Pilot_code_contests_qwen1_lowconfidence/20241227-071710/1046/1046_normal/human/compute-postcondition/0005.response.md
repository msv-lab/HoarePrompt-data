Based on the given initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact step-by-step:

- Initial State: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 1, `portal_jumps` is 1, and `p[0]` is less than 1.

- Code Snippet: `portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`

  - `portal_jumps` is initially set to 1.
  - `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, so `dp[j]` for any index `j` will be 0.
  - The expression `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` simplifies to `0 % 1000000007`, which is 0.
  - Therefore, `portal_jumps += 0`, meaning `portal_jumps` remains unchanged at 1.

The other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`, `i`, and `p[0]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 1, `portal_jumps` is 1, and `p[0]` is less than 1.**
