The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `portal_jumps`. This changes the value of `portal_jumps` from its previous value (which was the sum of `dp[j]` for all `j` in the range `p[i]` to `i` plus `i - p[i]` for all such `j`, and was also less than `i`), to `1`.

Since `n`, `p`, `dp`, `i`, and `portal_jumps` are involved, we need to consider their updated values:

- `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` remains a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` remains a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`.
- `i` remains `2`.
- `portal_jumps` is now `1`.

Given these conditions, the only value that has been updated is `portal_jumps`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`; `i` is `2`; `portal_jumps` is `1`.**
