The initial state is defined such that `total_pjumps` is \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + \text{dp}[2] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2)\), `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0. The code snippet adds 1 to `total_pjumps` modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\).

Given the initial state, let's denote the value of `total_pjumps` as follows:
\[ \text{total\_pjumps} = (\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + \text{dp}[2] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2) \]

After executing the code:
\[ \text{total\_pjumps} = \left( (\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + \text{dp}[2] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2) + 1 \right) \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) \]

Therefore, the updated value of `total_pjumps` is:
\[ \text{total\_pjumps} = \left( (\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + \text{dp}[2] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 3) \right) \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) \]

The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is \(\left( (\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + \text{dp}[2] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 3) \right) \mod (1000000000.0 + 7)\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
