The code snippet increments `portal_jumps` by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Since `1000000000.0 + 7` evaluates to `1000000007.0`, and `1 % 1000000007.0` is simply `1` (as 1 is less than 1000000007), the value of `portal_jumps` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` is 1, `portal_jumps` is 2, and `p[0]` is less than 1.**
