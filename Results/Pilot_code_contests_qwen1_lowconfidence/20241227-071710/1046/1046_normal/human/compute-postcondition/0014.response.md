The code snippet updates `dp[i]` with the value of `portal_jumps` modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given the initial state, we know:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `i` is `n`.
- `portal_jumps` is the sum of \(1\) for each valid `j` in the range `p[i]` to `i`.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. `portal_jumps` is the sum of `1` for each valid `j` in the range from `p[i]` to `i`. Since `p[i]` must be less than or equal to `i` for the loop to execute, `portal_jumps` is simply the count of integers from `p[i]` to `i`, which is `i - p[i] + 1`.
2. `dp[i]` is set to `int(portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7))`, which means `dp[i]` is the result of `i - p[i] + 1` modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\).

Since `dp` was initially a list of `n` zeros and now `dp[i]` is updated with the value of `portal_jumps` modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\), the updated state is:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) % 1000000007`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `portal_jumps` is `i - p[i] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) % 1000000007`; `i` is `n`; `portal_jumps` is `i - p[i] + 1.`**
