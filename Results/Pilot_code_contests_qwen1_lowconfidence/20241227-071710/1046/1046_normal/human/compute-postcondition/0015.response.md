Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) % 1000000007`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `portal_jumps` is `i - p[i] + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`.

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 0` and goes up to `i = n-1`.
   - At the start of the current iteration, `i` is `n`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be within the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, it does not satisfy the loop condition `i in range(n)`, which requires `0 <= i < n`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - To make the loop execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1 to enter the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `n-1`.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `p` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` remains unchanged.
   - `portal_jumps` is calculated based on `i` and `p[i]`, but since `i` is now `n-1`, we need to ensure `portal_jumps` is recalculated as `(n-1 - p[n-1] + 1) % 1000000007`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) % 1000000007`; `i` is `n-1`; `portal_jumps` is `(n-1 - p[n-1] + 1) % 1000000007.`**
