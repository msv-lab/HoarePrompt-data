`portal_jumps` is incremented by 1 and then taken modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given the initial state where `p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, and `portal_jumps` is its previous value plus `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`, the code only modifies `portal_jumps`. The updated value of `portal_jumps` will be the previous value of `portal_jumps` plus 1, modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `portal_jumps` is its previous value plus 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)**.
