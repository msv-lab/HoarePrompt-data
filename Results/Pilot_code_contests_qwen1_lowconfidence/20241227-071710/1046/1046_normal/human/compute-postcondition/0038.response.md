`portal_jumps` is initially its previous value plus `dp_1` modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Then, the code adds 1 to `portal_jumps` modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given that `p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, and the initial value of `portal_jumps` is its previous value + `dp_1` modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\), the updated value of `portal_jumps` is its previous value + `dp_1` + 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\).

Output State: **`p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `portal_jumps` is ((its previous value + dp_1) + 1) % (1000000000.0 + 7)**
