Step-by-step analysis of the given code snippet:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\)
   - `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `portal_jumps` is `(n - p[n-1] + 1) \% 1000000007`
   - `j` is `p[n-2] + 1` if `p[n-2] + 1 < n-1` otherwise `j` is `p[n-2]`

2. The code snippet updates `portal_jumps` as follows:
   ```python
   portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)
   ```

3. Since `dp[j]` is an integer, `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` simplifies to `dp[j] % 1000000007` (since `1000000000.0 + 7` is essentially treated as `1000000007` in integer operations).

4. After updating `portal_jumps`, the new value of `portal_jumps` is the old value of `portal_jumps` plus `dp[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`; `i` is `n-1`; `portal_jumps` is the original value of `portal_jumps` plus `dp[j] % 1000000007`; `j` is `p[n-2] + 1` if `p[n-2] + 1 < n-1` otherwise `j` is `p[n-2]`.**
