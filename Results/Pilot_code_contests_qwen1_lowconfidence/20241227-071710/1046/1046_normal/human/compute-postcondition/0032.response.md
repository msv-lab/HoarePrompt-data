The code increments `portal_jumps` by `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Since `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is simply `1` (because 1 modulo any number is 1), `portal_jumps` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `p[2]` is still `1`
- `i` is still `2`
- `portal_jumps` is now `(portal_jumps + dp[j]) % (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1`

Output State: **`p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `portal_jumps` is `(portal_jumps + dp[j]) % (1000000000.0 + 7) + 1**
