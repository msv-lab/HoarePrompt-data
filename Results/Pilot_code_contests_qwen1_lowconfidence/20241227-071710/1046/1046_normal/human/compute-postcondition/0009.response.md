The code `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` increments `portal_jumps` by 1 modulo \(1000000000.0 + 7\). Given that \(1000000000.0 + 7\) is a very large number, \(1 \% (1000000000.0 + 7)\) is simply 1. Therefore, `portal_jumps` is incremented by 1.

The values of `n`, `p`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` remains the same: `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` remains the same: `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is now 2; `portal_jumps` is now 3.**
