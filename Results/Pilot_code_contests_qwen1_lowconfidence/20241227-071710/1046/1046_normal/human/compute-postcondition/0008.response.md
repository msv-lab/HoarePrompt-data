`portal_jumps` is incremented by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. Since `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, each element in `dp` is 0. Therefore, `dp[j]` is 0 for any valid `j`. As a result, `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)` is also 0. This means that `portal_jumps` remains unchanged.

The output state is: **`n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` remains the same: `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` remains the same: `dp` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is now 2; `portal_jumps` remains the same: 2.**
