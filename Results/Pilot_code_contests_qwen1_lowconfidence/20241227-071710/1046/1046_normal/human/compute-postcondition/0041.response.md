Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 \).
- \( p \) is a list of \( n \) integers where \( 1 \leq p_i \leq i \) for each \( 0 \leq i < n \).
- \( dp \) is a list of \( n \) zeros.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    portal_jumps = 1
    for j in range(p[i], i):
        portal_jumps += dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)
        portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)
    dp[i] = int(portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7))
```

### Observations from Provided Output States:
- After 1 iteration, \( dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007 \).
- After 2 iterations, \( dp[i] \) is updated based on the sum of previous \( dp \) values and the increment \( i - p[i] + 1 \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initially, \( dp \) is a list of \( n \) zeros.
   - For each \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \), the inner loop starts from \( p[i] \) to \( i-1 \).

2. **Inner Loop Execution:**
   - For each \( j \) in the range \( p[i] \) to \( i-1 \), the value of \( dp[i] \) is updated by adding \( dp[j] \) and 1 to \( portal_jumps \).
   - Finally, \( dp[i] \) is set to \( portal_jumps \% 1000000007 \).

3. **Final State:**
   - After all iterations, \( dp \) will contain the final values calculated according to the recurrence relation.
   - The value of \( i \) will be \( n \).
   - The value of \( portal_jumps \) for each \( i \) will be the sum of \( dp[j] \) for all \( j \) in the range \( p[i] \) to \( i-1 \) plus \( i - p[i] \) plus the initial increment of 1.

### Final Output State:
- \( n \) remains as the input integer \( n \).
- \( p \) remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- \( dp \) contains the final values calculated by the recurrence relation.
- \( i \) is \( n \).
- \( portal_jumps \) for each \( i \) is the sum of \( dp[j] \) for all \( j \) in the range \( p[i] \) to \( i-1 \) plus \( i - p[i] \) plus the initial increment of 1.

**Output State:**
- **Output State:** `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 \); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq p_i \leq i \) for each \( 0 \leq i < n \); `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = \sum_{j=p[i]}^{i-1} (dp[j] + 1) \% 1000000007`; `i` is `n`; `portal_jumps` for each `i` is the sum of `dp[j]` for all `j` in the range `p[i]` to `i-1` plus `i - p[i]` plus the initial increment of 1.
