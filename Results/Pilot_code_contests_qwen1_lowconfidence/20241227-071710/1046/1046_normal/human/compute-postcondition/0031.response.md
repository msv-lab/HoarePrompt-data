`portal_jumps` is incremented by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. The initial value of `p[2]` is 1 and `i` is 2. However, the values of `portal_jumps` and `dp[j]` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `portal_jumps` has been updated, while `p[2]` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `portal_jumps` is `portal_jumps + dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`**
