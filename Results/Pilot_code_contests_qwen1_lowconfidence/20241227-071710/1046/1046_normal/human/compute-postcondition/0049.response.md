According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_pjumps` is \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2)\), `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`total_pjumps` is \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2)\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
