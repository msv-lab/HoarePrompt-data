The code `print(total_pjumps)` simply prints the value of `total_pjumps` but does not change its value or any other variable. Therefore, the output of the program will be the value of `total_pjumps`, and the other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (dp[i] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7)) + n\), `i` is \(n-1\), `n` must be greater than 0, and `total_pjumps` is printed.**
