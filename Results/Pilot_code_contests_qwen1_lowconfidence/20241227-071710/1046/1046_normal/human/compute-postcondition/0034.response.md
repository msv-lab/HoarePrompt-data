`portal_jumps` is incremented by `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`. The value of `p[2]`, `i`, and `portal_jumps` before the operation is given, but the exact value of `dp[j]` is not specified. Therefore, the new value of `portal_jumps` will be its previous value plus `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`.

Output State: **`p[2]` is 1, `i` is 2, `portal_jumps` is its previous value plus `dp[j] % (1000000000.0 + 7)`**
