The code snippet `portal_jumps += 1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` modifies the `portal_jumps` variable. Let's analyze the impact:

1. The expression `1 % (1000000000.0 + 7)` simplifies to `1 % 1000000007` because `1000000000.0 + 7` evaluates to `1000000007.0`, and the `%` operator in Python works with integer division, so `1 % 1000000007` is simply `1`.

2. Thus, `portal_jumps` is incremented by `1`. 

The other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\);
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\);
- `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`;
- `i` is `n-1`;
- `j` is `p[n-2] + 2` if `p[n-2] + 2 < n-1` or `p[n-2] + 1` if `p[n-2] + 2 == n-1`;
- `portal_jumps` is its original value plus `1` mod \(1000000007\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\); `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\); `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `p[n-2] + 2` if `p[n-2] + 2 < n-1` or `p[n-2] + 1` if `p[n-2] + 2 == n-1`; `portal_jumps` is its original value plus `1` mod \(1000000007\)**.
