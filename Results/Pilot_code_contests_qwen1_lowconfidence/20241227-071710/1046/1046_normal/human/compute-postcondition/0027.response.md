Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\), `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[i] = (i - p[i] + 1) \% 1000000007`, `i` is `1`, `portal_jumps` is the sum of `dp[j]` for all `j` in the range `p[i]` to `i` plus `i - p[i]` for all such `j`, and `p[i]` is less than `i`. `dp[i]` is updated to `int(portal_jumps % (1000000000.0 + 7))` for the current `i`.**
