`total_pjumps` is initially calculated as \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2)\). The value of `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 0. The code increments `total_pjumps` by \(\text{dp}[i] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7)\).

Since `i` is 2, the code updates `total_pjumps` to \( (\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2) + \text{dp}[2] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) \).

Therefore, the updated value of `total_pjumps` is \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + \text{dp}[2] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2)\).

The output state is: `total_pjumps` is \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + \text{dp}[2] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2)\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`total_pjumps` is \((\text{dp}[0] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + \text{dp}[2] \mod (1000000000.0 + 7) + 2)\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
