Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)) and `p` (a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq i\) for each \(0 \leq i < n\)). It calculates the total number of portal jumps required to navigate through the rooms from room 0 to room `n`, ensuring that the number of crosses changes from odd to even, and prints the result. The final state of the program is that it prints the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of portal jumps needed to change the cross count from odd to even starting from room `i` and returning to room `i` with an even number of crosses. The calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers. The function handles edge cases where `n` is 1 by directly setting `dp[0]` to 1 since no other calculation is needed.**
