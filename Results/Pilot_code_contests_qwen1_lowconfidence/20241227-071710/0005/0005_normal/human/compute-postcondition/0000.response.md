The code `sys.stdout = BytesIO()` changes the standard output to an in-memory byte stream. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `x`, or `v`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `x` is a list of n integers where each x_i is a distinct integer in the range [1, 10^8], `v` is a list of n integers where each v_i is in the range [-10^8, 10^8]; standard output is redirected to an in-memory byte stream.**
