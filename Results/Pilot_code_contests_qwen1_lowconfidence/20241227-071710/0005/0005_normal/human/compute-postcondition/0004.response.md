Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an in-memory byte stream object containing the first line read from standard input. However, there are several issues and edge cases that need to be considered:

1. The function sets up `sys.stdout` to redirect output to an in-memory buffer using `BytesIO`.
2. It registers a cleanup function using `atexit` to write the contents of the in-memory buffer back to standard output.
3. The function then reads the entire standard input into the in-memory buffer and returns the first line of this input as a byte stream.

Potential edge cases:
- If the standard input is empty, the function will return an empty byte stream.
- If the standard input contains multiple lines, only the first line will be returned.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where standard input is not available or cannot be read.
- There is no error handling for I/O operations, which could lead to exceptions if standard input is invalid or unavailable.**

This summary covers the actual behavior of the function based on the provided code, including potential edge cases and noting the missing error handling.**
