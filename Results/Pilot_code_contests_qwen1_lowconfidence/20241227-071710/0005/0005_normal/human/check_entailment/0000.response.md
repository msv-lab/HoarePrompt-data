Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points. The program uses a data structure and logic that seems to be aimed at solving a different problem, likely related to interval trees or a similar data structure, rather than the actual problem described.

The problem requires calculating the minimum distance between each pair of points over all possible moments of time. The solution should consider the relative speeds and initial positions of the points to determine the minimum distance for each pair.

However, the provided code appears to be using an order tree (which might be intended to be a segment tree or a similar data structure) to store and query some values, but it does not seem to implement the necessary logic to calculate the minimum distances correctly. Specifically, the `update` and `query` methods do not appear to handle the calculation of distances between points based on their speeds and initial positions.

A correct solution would involve sorting the points and then considering the relative movements to compute the minimum distances accurately. The current implementation does not seem to do this, and thus it fails to meet the problem requirements.
