Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the sum of minimum distances between all pairs of points over any possible moments of time. Specifically, the use of an order tree (Fenwick Tree) for updating and querying the positions of points is not appropriate for this problem. The main issue lies in how the distances are being calculated and accumulated.

The program seems to be trying to use a Fenwick Tree to keep track of the positions of points, but it does not correctly handle the calculation of the minimum distance between each pair of points. The logic inside the `update` and `query` methods of the `order_tree` class does not reflect the correct way to compute the minimum distance between points as described in the problem statement.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
1 3 2
-100 2 3

Expected Output:
3
```

In this case, the minimum distance between points (1, -100) and (3, 2) occurs when they are closest together, which would be when their positions are equal. However, the program does not correctly compute this distance.

The correct approach involves sorting the points by their speeds and calculating the differences in positions considering the time factor. The given implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
