Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to compute the sum of minimum distances \( \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} d(i, j) \) correctly. Here are the key issues:

1. **Data Structures and Logic**: 
   - The program uses a custom `order_tree` class to perform queries and updates, which seems unnecessary for this problem. The problem requires calculating the minimum distance between pairs of points over all possible times, but the current implementation does not directly address this requirement.
   - The logic inside the `query` method and `update` method of `order_tree` does not seem to align with the problem's requirements. These methods are used to manage and retrieve data, but they are not utilized in a way that would help calculate the minimum distances between pairs of points.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - The main part of the program processes the input points and their speeds, sorts them, and then iterates through the points in reverse order. However, the logic to calculate the minimum distance \(d(i, j)\) over all possible times is not correctly implemented.
   - The variable `ans` is updated using the values of `su` and `coun`, but this calculation does not accurately reflect the minimum distance between pairs of points. The logic for computing \(d(i, j)\) needs to account for the relative positions and speeds of the points over time.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Distance**:
   - To compute the minimum distance between two points \(i\) and \(j\) over all possible times, we need to consider the relative speed difference between them. The correct approach involves sorting the points and using their relative positions and speeds to find the minimum distance.
   - The current implementation does not handle this correctly. It seems to focus on some internal data structures rather than directly computing the required minimum distances.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
