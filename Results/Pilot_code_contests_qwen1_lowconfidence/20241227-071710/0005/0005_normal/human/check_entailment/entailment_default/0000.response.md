Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem of calculating the sum of minimum distances between all pairs of points over any possible moments of time. However, the implementation has several issues and does not fully address the problem requirements.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input Reading**: The function `func_1` is used to read the first line of input, but it is unnecessary and complicates the program. The main part of the code directly reads the input without using `func_1`.

2. **Sorting and Pair Calculation**: The program sorts the points by their speeds and uses an order tree (Fenwick tree) to calculate the sum of distances. However, the logic for calculating the distances is flawed. Specifically, the order tree is used in a way that does not correctly compute the minimum distance between pairs of points over time.

3. **Fenwick Tree Usage**: The Fenwick tree is incorrectly updated and queried. The tree should be used to keep track of the points' positions over time, but the current implementation does not correctly reflect this.

4. **Missing Distance Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the minimum distance between pairs of points over time is missing. The current implementation does not correctly handle the dynamic nature of the problem where points move at different speeds.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
