Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program uses a `func_1` function that redirects standard input to an in-memory buffer, which is irrelevant to the actual computation of the sum of minimum distances between points. The core logic for calculating the minimum distances is implemented in the main part of the program, but as analyzed, it does not correctly implement the required algorithm. The use of a Fenwick Tree is inappropriate for this specific problem, and the logic for calculating distances is flawed. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
