You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n points on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th point is located at the integer point x_i and has a speed v_i. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All n points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the i-th point at the moment t (t can be non-integer) is calculated as x_i + t ⋅ v_i.

Consider two points i and j. Let d(i, j) be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points i and j coincide at some moment, the value d(i, j) will be 0.

Your task is to calculate the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of points.

The second line of the input contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^8), where x_i is the initial coordinate of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all x_i are distinct.

The third line of the input contains n integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_n (-10^8 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^8), where v_i is the speed of the i-th point.

Output

Print one integer — the value ∑_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} d(i, j) (the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points. The program uses a data structure and logic that seems to be aimed at solving a different problem, likely related to interval trees or a similar data structure, rather than the actual problem described.

The problem requires calculating the minimum distance between each pair of points over all possible moments of time. The solution should consider the relative speeds and initial positions of the points to determine the minimum distance for each pair.

However, the provided code appears to be using an order tree (which might be intended to be a segment tree or a similar data structure) to store and query some values, but it does not seem to implement the necessary logic to calculate the minimum distances correctly. Specifically, the `update` and `query` methods do not appear to handle the calculation of distances between points based on their speeds and initial positions.

A correct solution would involve sorting the points and then considering the relative movements to compute the minimum distances accurately. The current implementation does not seem to do this, and thus it fails to meet the problem requirements.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. x is a list of n integers where each x_i is a distinct integer in the range [1, 10^8]. v is a list of n integers where each v_i is in the range [-10^8, 10^8].

    #The program returns an in-memory byte stream object that reads the first line from standard input, which was redirected from an unknown source during the program's execution
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an in-memory byte stream object containing the first line read from standard input. However, there are several issues and edge cases that need to be considered:

1. The function sets up `sys.stdout` to redirect output to an in-memory buffer using `BytesIO`.
2. It registers a cleanup function using `atexit` to write the contents of the in-memory buffer back to standard output.
3. The function then reads the entire standard input into the in-memory buffer and returns the first line of this input as a byte stream.

Potential edge cases:
- If the standard input is empty, the function will return an empty byte stream.
- If the standard input contains multiple lines, only the first line will be returned.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where standard input is not available or cannot be read.
- There is no error handling for I/O operations, which could lead to exceptions if standard input is invalid or unavailable.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
