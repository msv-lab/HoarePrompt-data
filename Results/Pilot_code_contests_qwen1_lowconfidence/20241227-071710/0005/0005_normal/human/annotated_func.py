#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. x is a list of n integers where each x_i is a distinct integer in the range [1, 10^8]. v is a list of n integers where each v_i is in the range [-10^8, 10^8].
def func_1():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns an in-memory byte stream object that reads the first line from standard input, which was redirected from an unknown source during the program's execution
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an in-memory byte stream object containing the first line read from standard input. However, there are several issues and edge cases that need to be considered:

1. The function sets up `sys.stdout` to redirect output to an in-memory buffer using `BytesIO`.
2. It registers a cleanup function using `atexit` to write the contents of the in-memory buffer back to standard output.
3. The function then reads the entire standard input into the in-memory buffer and returns the first line of this input as a byte stream.

Potential edge cases:
- If the standard input is empty, the function will return an empty byte stream.
- If the standard input contains multiple lines, only the first line will be returned.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where standard input is not available or cannot be read.
- There is no error handling for I/O operations, which could lead to exceptions if standard input is invalid or unavailable.
