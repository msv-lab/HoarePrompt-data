Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Although the annotated version provides more context about the states of the program, it confirms that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically:

1. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile. It calculates the net count of '+' and '-' operations but does not account for the initial number of stones in the pile. The value passed to `func_2` is the net count, not the minimal possible number of stones.

2. The function `func_2` is not defined or called correctly within `func_1`. Even if `func_2` were defined and used correctly, it would not solve the problem as stated, since it simply prints values without addressing the core requirement of finding the minimal possible number of stones.

3. The program lacks the necessary logic to determine the minimal number of stones initially needed to satisfy the conditions of the problem. For example, in the input `---`, the program should start with 3 stones to end up with 0 stones, but it does not account for this initial condition.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is not correct.
