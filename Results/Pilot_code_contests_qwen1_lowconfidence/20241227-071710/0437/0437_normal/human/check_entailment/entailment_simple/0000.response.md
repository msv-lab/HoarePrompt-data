Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly compute the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. Let's analyze why:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after a series of operations (`-` for taking a stone, `+` for adding a stone).
   - The initial number of stones in the pile must be enough to perform all the `-'` operations without making the pile empty at any point.
   - After performing all operations, the result should be the minimal possible number of stones.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program initializes `cnt` to 0 and iterates through the string `s`. For each `-` character, it increments `cnt` by 1, and for each `+` character, it decrements `cnt` by 1.
   - If `cnt` becomes negative, it resets `cnt` to 0.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2(cnt)` to print the result.

3. **Issue**:
   - The logic to determine the minimal possible number of stones is flawed. The current approach simply counts the net difference between the `+` and `-` operations, but it doesn't account for the minimum initial number of stones required to avoid running out of stones during the operations.
   - For example, consider the input `"--+"`. The program would calculate `cnt = 1` (since it starts with 1 stone and ends with 1 stone), but the minimal possible number of stones is actually 2, because the pile needs to have at least 2 stones initially to avoid running out of stones during the operations.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to keep track of the minimum value of `cnt` during the iteration. This minimum value represents the number of stones needed at each step to ensure the pile never becomes empty.
   - Initialize `min_stones` to 0 and update it during the iteration.
   - After the loop, the minimal possible number of stones will be `max(min_stones, 0)`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = 0
    current_stones = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '+':
            current_stones += 1
        else:
            current_stones -= 1
        
        min_stones = min(min_stones, current_stones)
    
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed: `min_stones` is the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.
    print(min_stones + 1)  # Adding 1 to convert from 0-based to 1-based count
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimal possible number of stones is calculated correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description.
