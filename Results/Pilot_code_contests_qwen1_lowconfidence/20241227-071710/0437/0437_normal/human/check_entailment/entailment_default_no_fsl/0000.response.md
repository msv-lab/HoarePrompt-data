Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires finding the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after performing the operations. However, the current implementation of `func_1` simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and resets the count to 0 if it becomes negative. This approach does not account for the initial number of stones in the pile and does not ensure the minimal possible number of stones.

To illustrate, consider the following cases:

1. **Input**: `3\n---`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Current Output: The code calculates the net change as `-3`, but it should start with an initial number of stones (at least 3) to make the pile empty after operations. The current implementation does not handle this.

2. **Input**: `4\n++++`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Current Output: The code calculates the net change as `4`, but it should start with an initial number of stones (at least 0) to ensure the pile ends with 4 stones. The current implementation does not handle this.

3. **Input**: `2\n-+`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Current Output: The code calculates the net change as `0`, but it should start with an initial number of stones (at least 1) to ensure the pile ends with 1 stone. The current implementation does not handle this.

4. **Input**: `5\n++-++`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Current Output: The code calculates the net change as `3`, but it should start with an initial number of stones (at least 0) to ensure the pile ends with 3 stones. The current implementation does not handle this.

The correct approach would be to start with an initial number of stones (which is at least 1 since the pile cannot be empty before the first operation) and adjust the count accordingly. The minimal possible number of stones is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of the operations starting from 1.
