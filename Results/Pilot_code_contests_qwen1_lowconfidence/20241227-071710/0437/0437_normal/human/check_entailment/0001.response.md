Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial number of stones is less than the number of operations that involve taking a stone. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the initial number of stones in the pile. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
---
```

The output should be `0`, but the program will incorrectly output `0` even if the initial number of stones is less than `3`. For instance, if the initial number of stones is `1`, after performing the operations, the pile will be empty, but the program does not check the initial number of stones. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement that the pile should not be empty before each operation of taking a stone.
