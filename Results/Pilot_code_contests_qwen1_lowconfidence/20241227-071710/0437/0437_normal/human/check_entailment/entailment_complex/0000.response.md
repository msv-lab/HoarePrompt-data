Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the pile never becomes empty when a stone is taken. 

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
3
---
```

According to the problem description, the initial number of stones in the pile must be at least 3 to allow Vasya to take one stone three times. However, the code will output 0 as the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations, which is incorrect. The code resets `cnt` to 0 whenever it becomes negative, effectively allowing the pile to become empty, which violates the requirement that the pile must remain non-empty before each operation of taking a stone.

The correct approach would be to ensure that the pile never becomes empty. This can be achieved by initializing `cnt` to 1 (or any positive number) and then updating it based on the operations, but ensuring that it remains non-negative.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 1  # Start with at least 1 stone
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
        if cnt < 1:  # Ensure the pile is not empty
            cnt = 1
    
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed:
    # `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `s` is a string entered by the user, 
    # `cnt` is the net count of '+` and '-'` in the string `s` up to index `n-1`, 
    # ensuring the pile never becomes empty.
    func_2(cnt)

def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed:
    # `sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists;
    # `file` contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`;
    # `at_start` is `False`;
    # `args` is an empty list.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    # State of the program after the if block has been executed:
    # `sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists;
    # `file` contains `b'\n'`;
    # `at_start` is `False`;
    # `args` is an empty list;
    # the value of `kwargs` has had its `'flush'` key popped with a value of `False`.
```

This corrected version ensures that the pile never becomes empty, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description.
