Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The code attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:

1. The function `func_2` is not defined or called correctly within `func_1`.
2. The logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle the minimal number of stones in the pile after performing the operations. Specifically, it does not account for the initial number of stones in the pile correctly.

Given the output hints, `func_2` is expected to print the result, but it is not defined or called within the provided code. This means the program will fail to execute correctly even if the logic were perfect.

For example, considering the input:
```
3
---
```
The expected output is `0`, but due to the undefined and un-called `func_2`, the program will raise an error, indicating that the program is not correctly implementing the solution.

Thus, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
