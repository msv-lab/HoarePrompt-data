Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program attempts to calculate the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. However, the function `func_2` is not defined and called correctly within `func_1`. This results in the program not producing the expected output.

Specifically, the function `func_2` is intended to print the result, but it is not implemented to do so. Instead, it only processes arguments without printing anything. The main logic in `func_1` calculates the net effect of the operations but does not use `func_2` to print the result.

Given the problem description and the requirements, the program should print the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations. Since `func_2` is not defined or used correctly to achieve this, the program does not meet the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is accurate.
