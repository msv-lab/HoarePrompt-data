Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. Specifically, the function `func_2` is not defined or called correctly, and the logic in `func_1` does not handle all edge cases properly.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3
---
```

Expected output:
```
0
```

However, the program will output an error message because `func_2` is not defined and called correctly within `func_1`. This indicates that the program does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimal possible number of stones in the pile and ensure that `func_2` is defined and called appropriately.
