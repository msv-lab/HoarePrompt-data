Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations. The function `func_1` processes the string `s` and keeps track of the net count of additions and subtractions of stones, but it does not ensure that the pile remains non-empty after each subtraction. The problem specifies that the pile must remain non-empty before each operation of taking a stone from the pile.

The function `func_2` simply prints the value passed to it, which is not relevant to solving the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following examples:

1. **Input**: `3 ---`
   - **Expected Output**: `0`
   - **Actual Output**: The code would calculate `cnt` as follows:
     - Initially `cnt = 0`
     - `-`: `cnt = -1`
     - `-`: `cnt = -2`
     - `-`: `cnt = -3`
   - Since `cnt` goes below 0, it is reset to 0, and `func_2` is called with `0`.
   - **Issue**: The code does not ensure that the pile remains non-empty, so it incorrectly returns `0`.

2. **Input**: `4 ++++`
   - **Expected Output**: `4`
   - **Actual Output**: The code would calculate `cnt` as follows:
     - Initially `cnt = 0`
     - `+`: `cnt = 1`
     - `+`: `cnt = 2`
     - `+`: `cnt = 3`
     - `+`: `cnt = 4`
   - The final value of `cnt` is 4, and `func_2` is called with `4`.
   - **Issue**: The code does not handle the case where the initial number of stones is less than the number of additions, leading to an incorrect result.

3. **Input**: `2 -+`
   - **Expected Output**: `1`
   - **Actual Output**: The code would calculate `cnt` as follows:
     - Initially `cnt = 0`
     - `-`: `cnt = -1`
     - `+`: `cnt = 0`
   - The final value of `cnt` is 0, and `func_2` is called with `0`.
   - **Issue**: The code does not ensure that the pile remains non-empty after each subtraction, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, and it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
