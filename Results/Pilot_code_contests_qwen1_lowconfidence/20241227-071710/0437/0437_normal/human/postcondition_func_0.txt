The function `func_1` processes a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `s` consists of '-' and '+' characters. It calculates the net count of '+' and '-' characters in the string up to each position and stores the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during this process. If at any point `cnt` becomes negative, it is reset to zero. After processing the entire string, it calls `func_2` with the final value of `cnt`. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the string could be either '+' or '-'), and when `s` contains only one type of character.
