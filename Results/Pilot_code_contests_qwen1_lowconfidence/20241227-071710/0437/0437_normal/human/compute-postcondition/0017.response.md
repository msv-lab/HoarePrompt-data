`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The value of `x` is converted to a string and appended to `file`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Since `args` is a list containing one element and `x` is converted to a string and written to `file`, the value of `file` changes, but the precondition related to `args` remains the same. The value of `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `args` are unchanged except for the fact that `x` is now a string and written to `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is either `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` now contains the previous content of `file` followed by the string representation of `x` and the previous separator; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a list containing one element; `x` is a string.**
