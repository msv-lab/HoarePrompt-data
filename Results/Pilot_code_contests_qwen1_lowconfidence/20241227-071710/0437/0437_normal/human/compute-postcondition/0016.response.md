Postcondition: ***`sep` is either `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` plus the separator (`sep`), followed by `sep`, followed by the previous content of `file`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a list containing one element; `x` is converted to a string and written to `file`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.***
