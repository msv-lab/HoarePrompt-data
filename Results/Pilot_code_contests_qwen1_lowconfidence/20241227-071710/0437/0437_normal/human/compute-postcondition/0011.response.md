Postcondition: ***`sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` up to the current point, followed by the separator (`sep`) and the previous content of `file`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is an empty list. Since the `if` condition is checked and `at_start` is `False`, the program will execute the if part, updating `file` with the necessary separator and concatenating the previous content of `file`.***
