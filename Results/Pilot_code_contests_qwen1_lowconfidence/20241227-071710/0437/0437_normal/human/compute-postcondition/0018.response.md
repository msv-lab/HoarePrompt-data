`at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sep` is either `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` now contains the previous content of `file` followed by the string representation of `x` and the previous separator; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is a list containing one element; `x` is a string.**
