The code `file.flush()` flushes the file buffer but does not change the value of the `file` variable itself. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` contains `b'\n'`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is an empty list; `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`; the value of `kwargs` has had its `'flush'` key popped with a value of `False`**
