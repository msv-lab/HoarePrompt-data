The variable `at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. This changes the value of `at_start` from its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` plus the separator (`sep`), followed by the previous content of `file`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is an empty list; `x` is converted to a string and written to `file`.**
