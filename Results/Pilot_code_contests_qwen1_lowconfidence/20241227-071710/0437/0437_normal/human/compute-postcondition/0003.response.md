Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables and Their States**: The initial states given are `sep`, `file`, and `at_start`.
   - `sep` is either `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists.
   - `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a value corresponding to the 'file' key in `kwargs` if it exists.
   - `at_start` is `True`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs over `args` using the `for` loop construct. For the loop to start executing, `args` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `at_start` is `True`, this variable itself doesn't affect whether the loop will run but indicates the starting state.
   - The `sep` and `file` variables determine how the elements of `args` will be printed but don't affect whether the loop will run.
   - The loop will run only if `args` contains at least one element.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `args` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists, `file` is `sys.stdout` or a value corresponding to the 'file' key in `kwargs` if it exists, `at_start` is `True`, `args` must contain at least one element**.
