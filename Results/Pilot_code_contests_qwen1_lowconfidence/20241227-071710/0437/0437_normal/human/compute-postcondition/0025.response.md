Functionality: **The function `func_2()` takes variable arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). It prints the string representations of the arguments to a specified output stream (`file`), using a specified separator (`sep`), and ends with a specified ending character (`end`). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, it flushes the stream. The function does not return anything. After execution, the `file` will contain the concatenated string representations of the arguments separated by the specified separator, followed by the specified ending character. If `sep` or `end` are not provided, default values of a space and a newline are used respectively.**

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where `file` is not a valid stream object, which could lead to an error.
- The function does not check if `sep` and `end` are valid strings or bytes.
- The function assumes that `args` contains only items that can be converted to strings using `str()`. If `args` contains items that cannot be converted to strings, a `TypeError` would be raised.
- The function does not handle the case where `args` is empty, although the provided annotation suggests that `args` should not be empty after processing, which might be a mistake since `args` is consumed during the loop.
