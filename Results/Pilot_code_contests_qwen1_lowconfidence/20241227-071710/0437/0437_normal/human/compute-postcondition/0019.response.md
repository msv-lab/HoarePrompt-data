Output State: **`sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` contains the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is an empty list.** 

Explanation:
- Initially, `at_start` is `True`. After the first iteration, `at_start` becomes `False`.
- For each element `x` in `args`, `str(x)` is written to `file`. If it is not the first iteration (i.e., `at_start` is `False`), `sep` is also written to `file` before `str(x)`.
- The loop continues until all elements in `args` have been processed. Once the loop finishes, `args` will be an empty list since each element has been processed.
- The final state of `file` will be the concatenation of all `str(x)` with `sep` in between each `str(x)`.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `args` is an empty list initially), then:
- `at_start` remains `True` because no iterations occur.
- `file` remains unchanged as no writes occur.
- `sep` remains its initial value (`b' '` or a value from `kwargs`).
- `args` is an empty list.
