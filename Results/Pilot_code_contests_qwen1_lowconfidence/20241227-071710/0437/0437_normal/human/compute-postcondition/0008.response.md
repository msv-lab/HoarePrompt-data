The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. This means the previous value of `at_start` is overridden. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` is `sys.stdout` or a value corresponding to the 'file' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must contain at least one element; `file` now contains the string representation of `x` followed by the previous content.**
