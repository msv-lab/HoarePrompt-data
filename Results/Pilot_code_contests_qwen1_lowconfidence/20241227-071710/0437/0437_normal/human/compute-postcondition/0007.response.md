`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Since `at_start` is `False`, the condition for writing `sep` to `file` does not apply, meaning `sep` is not written to `file`. The value of `file` remains unchanged, and `x` is converted to a string and written to `file`.

Output State: **`sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` is `sys.stdout` or a value corresponding to the 'file' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `at_start` is `False`; `args` must contain at least one element; `file` now contains the string representation of `x` followed by the previous content.**
