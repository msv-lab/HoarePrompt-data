The given code snippet does not actually modify any variables or perform any operations that would change the state of the program. It merely describes a function that prints values to a stream, which is specified as `sys.stdout` by default. Since no variables are assigned new values or manipulated in any way within this function, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The function does not contribute directly to solving the problem described in the problem statement. Instead, it prints values to a stream. However, the variables in its signature include *args.**
