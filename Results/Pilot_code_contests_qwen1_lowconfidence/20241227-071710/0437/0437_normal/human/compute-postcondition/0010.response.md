The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object `file`. Given the initial state, `sep` is either `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists, and `at_start` is `False`. The value of `sep` is written to `file`, but no other changes occur to the other variables.

Output State: **`sep` is `b' '` or a value corresponding to the 'sep' key in `kwargs` if it exists; `file` now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` up to the current point, followed by the separator (`sep`) and the previous content of `file`; `at_start` is `False`; `args` is an empty list.**
