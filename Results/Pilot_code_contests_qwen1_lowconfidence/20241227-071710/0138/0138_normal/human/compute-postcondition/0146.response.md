The code snippet `scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1` involves the following steps:

1. `ord(t[i])` returns the Unicode code point of the character `t[i]`.
2. `ord('a')` returns the Unicode code point of the character 'a'.
3. The subtraction `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')` computes the difference between these two values.
4. This difference is used as an index into the list `scount`.
5. The value at this index in `scount` is decremented by 1.

However, the code snippet provided does not define `scount` or `t`, which are necessary to execute the line of code. Given the initial state where `works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is an empty list, we cannot proceed further without knowing the values of `scount` and `t`.

Since the variables `works` and `res` are not affected by the given line of code, and there is insufficient information about `scount` and `t` to determine the exact changes, we cannot provide a specific output state.

Output State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than or equal to 0; `res` is an empty list**
