The code `cando = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `cando`. The other variables (`scountcopy` and `j`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`scountcopy` is a list of integers, `cando` is True, and `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 2`**
