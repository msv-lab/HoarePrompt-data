`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is 26, and the initial value of `scount[26]` is greater than 0. After decrementing, `scount[26]` will be one less than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z', 'u'; `scount[25]` is 0; `i` is 26; `scount[26]` is greater than 0 - 1**
