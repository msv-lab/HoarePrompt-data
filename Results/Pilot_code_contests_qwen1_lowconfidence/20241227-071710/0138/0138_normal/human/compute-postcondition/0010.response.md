Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from an input string; `tcount` remains unchanged as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; `scount` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of a specific character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the list `s`.
- For each character `char` in `s`, the corresponding index in `scount` (which is `ord(char) - ord('a')`) is incremented by 1.
- After all characters in `s` have been processed, `scount` will contain the frequency of each letter from 'a' to 'z' in the string `s`.
- `tcount` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Since the loop processes all characters in `s`, the final state of `scount` will be a representation of the character frequency in the entire string `s`. The values in `tcount` remain zero as they are not affected by the loop.
