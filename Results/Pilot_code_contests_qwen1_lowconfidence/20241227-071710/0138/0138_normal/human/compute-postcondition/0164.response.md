Postcondition: ***`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1, `t[works]` is a valid character ('a' to 'z'), `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, `res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t` plus the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `scount[j] > 0` for all `j` in the range, and `scount[j]` is decreased by 1 if `scount[j] > 0`, with `scount` being updated accordingly, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
