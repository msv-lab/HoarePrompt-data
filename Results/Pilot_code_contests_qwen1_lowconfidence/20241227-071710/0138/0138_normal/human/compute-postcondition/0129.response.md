The code sets `cando` to `True`. The initial values of the other variables are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is unchanged, `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 3`, and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.**
