According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`. At the end of the last iteration, `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is unchanged, and `j` is unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `i` was incremented during the last iteration, it is now `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged**
