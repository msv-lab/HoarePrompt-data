The line `cando = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `cando`. Since this is a direct assignment and does not depend on any previous value of `cando` (other than setting it to `True`), the previous value of `cando` being `True` remains unchanged. The other variables (`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]`, `works`, `j`, and `scountcopy[j]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is unchanged, `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 2`, and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0**
