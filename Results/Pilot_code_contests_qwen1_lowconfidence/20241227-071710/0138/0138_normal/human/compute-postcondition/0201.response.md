The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `i + ord('a')` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is initially 27, the ASCII value of the character to be appended is `27 + ord('a')`. Since `ord('a')` is 97, the ASCII value of the character is `27 + 97`, which is 124. The character corresponding to ASCII value 124 is '|'. 

Therefore, the list `res` will now contain the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z', 'u', '{', and '|'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z', 'u', '{', '|'; `scount[27]` must be greater than 0; `i` is 27**
