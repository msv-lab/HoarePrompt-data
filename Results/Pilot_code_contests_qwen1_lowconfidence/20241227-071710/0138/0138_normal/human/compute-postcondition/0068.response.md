`t` is a list of characters, and it currently contains the characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'b'. The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `i + ord('a')` to the list `t`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + ord('a')` is `2 + 97`, which equals `99`. The ASCII value `99` corresponds to the character `'c'`. Therefore, `'c'` is appended to the list `t`.

The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`total` is updated, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers, `allgreater` is True, `t` is a list of characters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'b', 'c'], `i` is 2, `scount[25]` is 0, `scount[1]` is greater than 0, `scount[2]` is initially greater than 1**
