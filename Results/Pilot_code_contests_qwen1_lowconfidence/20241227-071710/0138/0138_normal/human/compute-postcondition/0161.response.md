`res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t` plus the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `scount[j] > 0` for all `j` in the range. The code snippet `res.append(chr(j + ord('a')))` appends the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` to the list `res`. The value of `j` is not specified, but it is implied that `scount[j] > 0` is true for the appended character. 

Since `scount[j] > 0` is true, `chr(j + ord('a'))` is appended to `res`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1, `t[works]` is a valid character ('a' to 'z'), `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, `res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t` plus the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` and `chr(j + ord('a'))` is appended, `scount` is updated accordingly.**
