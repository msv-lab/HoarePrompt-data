Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1.
   - `cando` is True.
   - `works` is unchanged.
   - `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.
   - `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 (inclusive).

3. **What Happens in Each Iteration:**
   - The loop will check if `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.
   - If `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, the loop will continue.
   - If `scountcopy[j]` is not greater than 0, `cando` remains True, `works` is unchanged, and `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is already set to `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will increment to `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `scountcopy[j + 1]` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1.
- `cando` remains True.
- `works` is unchanged.
- `j` is incremented to `j + 1`, so `j` becomes `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 2`.
- `scountcopy[j]` (which is now `scountcopy[j + 1]` from the previous iteration) must be greater than 0.

State: **`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is unchanged, `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 2`, and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.**
