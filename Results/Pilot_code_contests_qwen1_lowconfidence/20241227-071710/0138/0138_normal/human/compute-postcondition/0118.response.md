`scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, this means:

- `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` was previously non-zero (since `cando` remains `True`), so now it is reduced by 1.
- `cando` remains `True` unless `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` becomes 0, which does not happen here since it was decremented from a non-zero value.
- `works` remains unchanged if `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] != 0`, which is true in this case.
- `j` remains unchanged as the assignment to `j` is not part of the given code.

Therefore, the updated values are:

- `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1.
- `cando` remains `True`.
- `works` remains unchanged.
- `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged**
