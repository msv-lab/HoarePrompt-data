The code snippet appends the character corresponding to `i` (which is 25) to the list `res`. Since `i` is 25, the character appended is ``z`` (as `ord('z')` is 122 and `i + ord('a')` is 122 - 97 + 97 = 122, which is `z`). 

Given the initial state:
- `works` is a non-negative integer
- `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1)` and one additional element
- `scount` is updated such that all counts for the first `works` elements of `t` are zero, and `scount[25]` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 25

After executing `res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))`, the list `res` will have the character `z` appended to it. All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1)`, `z` and one additional element; `scount` is updated such that all counts for the first `works` elements of `t` are zero, and `scount[25]` must be greater than 0; `i` is 25**
