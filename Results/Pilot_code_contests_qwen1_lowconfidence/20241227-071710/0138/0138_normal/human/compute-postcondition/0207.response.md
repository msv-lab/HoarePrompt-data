Functionality: **The function compares the frequency of characters in two input strings, `s` and `t`. It then checks if every character in `s` appears at least as many times as in `t`. If `s` and `t` have the same length and this condition is met, it returns -1. Otherwise, it constructs a string where each character from 'a' to 'z' appears a number of times equal to the minimum between its frequency in `s` and `t`. In case `s` cannot be transformed to match `t` by reducing frequencies, it returns -1.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
1. If both `s` and `t` are empty, the function does not handle this case explicitly. However, since the input guarantees that `s` and `t` are non-empty, this edge case is not relevant.
2. The function does not handle the case where `s` contains characters not present in `t`. If `s` has a character that `t` does not have, the function will incorrectly assume the character count is zero in `t` when comparing frequencies.
3. The function does not account for the possibility that `t` might have duplicate characters that do not affect the final result. This could lead to unnecessary complexity in the construction of the resulting string.
4. The function does not ensure that the resulting string matches the exact character frequencies in `s` when constructing the final output. It simply appends characters based on the minimum frequency found, which might not always align perfectly with the original string `s`.

In summary, the function aims to compare the character frequencies of two strings and construct a new string based on these frequencies. However, there are several edge cases and potential oversights in the current implementation that need addressing.
