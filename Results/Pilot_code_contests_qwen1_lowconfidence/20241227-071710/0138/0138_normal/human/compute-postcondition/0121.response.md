Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to `26`.
   - The loop variable `j` is used in the expression `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')] -= 1`.

2. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is already decreased by 1.
   - `cando` is False.
   - `works` is unchanged.
   - `j` is unchanged.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must start within the specified range (`ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to `26`).
   - The value of `j` at the start of the loop should be `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is unchanged and we need it to start at `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is set to this value at the beginning of the loop.
   - The values of `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]`, `cando`, `works`, and `j` need to be adjusted accordingly.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must be equal to `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.
- `cando` remains `False`.
- `works` remains unchanged.
- `scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is already decreased by 1.

So, the final state should be:
State: **`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is False, `works` is unchanged, `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`**
