The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is based on certain conditions and outputs as described:

- Case_1: The function returns -1
- Case_2: The function returns a string containing all characters from 'a' to 'z' each appearing 0 times, as indicated by the `scount` list of 26 zeros
- Case_3: The function returns -1
- Case_4: The function returns a string containing all characters from 'a' to 'z' repeated a number of times specified by the corresponding values in `scount`, which is a list of 26 zeros

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to return either -1 or a string with specific conditions based on the `scount` list.

Functionality: **The function returns -1 in two cases, returns a string containing all characters from 'a' to 'z' each appearing 0 times as indicated by the `scount` list of 26 zeros in two other cases.**
