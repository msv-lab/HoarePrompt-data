The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `i + ord('a')` to the list `t`. Given that `i` is initially 1, appending `chr(1 + ord('a'))` will append the character `'b'` to the list `t`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. The initial state includes: `total` is updated, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers, `allgreater` is True, `t` is `['a', 'a']`, `i` is 1, and `scount[1]` must be greater than 0.
2. The code `t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))` appends the character `'b'` (since `1 + ord('a')` equals 98, and `chr(98)` is `'b'`) to the list `t`.
3. After appending, `t` becomes `['a', 'a', 'b']`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `total` is updated, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers, `allgreater` is True, `t` is `['a', 'a', 'b']`, `i` is 1, and `scount[1]` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`total` is updated, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers, `allgreater` is True, `t` is `['a', 'a', 'b']`, `i` is 1, and `scount[1]` must be greater than 0**
