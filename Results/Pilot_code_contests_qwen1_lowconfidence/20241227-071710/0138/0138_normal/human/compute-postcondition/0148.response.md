The code snippet `res.append(t[i])` attempts to append an element from the list `t` at index `i` to the list `res`. However, there are a few issues with the provided code snippet:

1. The variable `t` is not defined in the initial state.
2. The variable `res` is not defined in the initial state.

Given these points, the code will raise a NameError because `t` and `res` are undefined. Since the code cannot be executed as given, no changes are made to any variables, and the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `t` is undefined; `res` is undefined.**
