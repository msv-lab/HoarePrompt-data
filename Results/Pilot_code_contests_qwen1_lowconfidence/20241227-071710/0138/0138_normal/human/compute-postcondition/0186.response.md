Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `scount[i] > 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as `scount[i]` is greater than 0.

2. **Current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `works` is a non-negative integer.
   - `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), 'z'` and one additional element.
   - `scount[25]` has been decremented by 1, i.e., `scount[25] - 1`.
   - `i` is 25.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `scount[i]` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is 25, we need `scount[25]` to be greater than 0.

4. **Check the current value of `scount[25]`**:
   - After the previous iteration, `scount[25]` was decremented by 1, so `scount[25]` is now `scount[25] - 1`.
   - For `scount[25]` to be greater than 0, it must have been at least 1 before the decrement.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `scount[25]`. It must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), 'z'` and one additional element; `scount[25]` must be greater than 0; `i` is 25**
