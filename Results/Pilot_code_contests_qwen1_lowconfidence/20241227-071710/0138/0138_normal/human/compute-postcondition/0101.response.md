Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `s` is a list of characters.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`.
- `allgreater` is `False`.
- `t` must either contain at least one character or be an empty list.
- `i` is 2 (the length of `t`).
- `works` is the number of times the loop has executed (which is equal to the number of times `cando` was set to `True`).
- `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` where the count of character `t[0]` (which is 'b') is decremented by 1.
- `cando` is `False`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over the range from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to `25` (since the range goes up to but does not include the upper limit).

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: `i` is 2, so we need to consider `t[2]`.

3. **Character Range**: The loop will start from the ASCII value of `t[2]` (which is `'b'`) and go up to the 25th character in the alphabet (`'z'`).

4. **Ensure Validity of `t[i]`**: Since `i` is 2, `t[2]` should be a valid character between `'a'` and `'z'`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will only execute if `t[2]` is a valid character between `'a'` and `'z'`.
- The initial value of `i` is given as 2, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

### Final State Adjustment:
Given that the loop is dependent on the character `t[2]` being within the valid range of `'a'` to `'z'`, we need to ensure this condition holds true.

**State:**
- `s` is a list of characters.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`.
- `allgreater` is `False`.
- `t` must either contain at least one character or be an empty list.
- `i` is 2 (the length of `t`).
- `works` is the number of times the loop has executed (which is equal to the number of times `cando` was set to `True`).
- `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` where the count of character `t[0]` (which is 'b') is decremented by 1.
- `cando` is `False`.
- `t[2]` must be a valid character between `'a'` and `'z'`.

**State:**
**`s` is a list of characters, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`, `allgreater` is `False`, `t` must either contain at least one character or be an empty list, `i` is 2 (the length of `t`), `works` is the number of times the loop has executed (which is equal to the number of times `cando` was set to `True`), `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` where the count of character `t[0]` (which is 'b') is decremented by 1, `cando` is `False`, and `t[2]` must be a valid character between `'a'` and `'z'`.**
