The code `t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))` appends a character to the list `t`. Given that `i` is initially 25, `i + ord('a')` evaluates to `25 + 97`, which equals `122`. The character corresponding to ASCII value `122` is `'z'`. Therefore, `'z'` is appended to the list `t`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `total` is updated.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers.
- `allgreater` is `True`.
- `t` now includes all characters from 'a' to 'z' plus an additional `'z'`.
- `i` is updated to `25 + 1` because appending to a list in Python does not change the index `i` but rather increments it implicitly for the next operation.
- `scount[25]` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`total` is updated, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers, `allgreater` is True, `t` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and 'z', `i` is 26, and `scount[25]` must be greater than 0**
