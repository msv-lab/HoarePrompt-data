State before the loop starts: `works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1; `res` is an empty list

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop `for i in range(works)` will execute as long as `works` is a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0).
2. Since `works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1, we need to ensure that `works` is at least 0 for the loop to execute.
3. The initial value of `i` will be 0, but this does not need to be explicitly mentioned since the loop will start with `i = 0`.
4. The state of `res` being an empty list does not affect the loop execution directly.

Based on the above reasoning, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute, which means `works` must be greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than or equal to 0; `res` is an empty list**
