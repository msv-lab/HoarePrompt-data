The code `t = list(raw_input())` takes an input from the user and converts it into a list of characters. Initially, `t` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, and `s` is a list of characters from the input string. After executing the code, `t` will be converted into a list of characters from the user's input, while `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, `t` is a list of characters from the user's input**
