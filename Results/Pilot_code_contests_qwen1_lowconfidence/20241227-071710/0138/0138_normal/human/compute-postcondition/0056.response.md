To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given Conditions:
- `total` is updated (no specific value needed to be adjusted as it's not relevant to the loop condition).
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers (no specific value needed to be adjusted as it's not relevant to the loop condition).
- `allgreater` is True (no specific value needed to be adjusted as it's not relevant to the loop condition).
- `t` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and 'z' (no specific value needed to be adjusted as it's not relevant to the loop condition).
- `i` is 26 (no specific value needed to be adjusted as it's not relevant to the loop condition).
- `scount[25]` is 0 (this is the key condition related to the loop).

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues while `scount[i] > 0`.

### Current State:
- `scount[25]` is 0.

For the loop to continue executing, `scount[i]` must be greater than 0. Currently, `scount[25]` is 0, which means the condition is false and the loop will not execute again unless `scount[25]` becomes greater than 0.

### Required Adjustment:
Since `scount[25]` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust this state.

### Final Answer:
State: **`scount[25]` must be greater than 0**
