The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `i + ord('a')` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is initially 26, the character appended will be the ASCII character for the value `26 + ord('a')`. Since `ord('a')` is 97, `i + ord('a')` equals 123, which corresponds to the character `'{'. Therefore, the list `res` will have its last element updated to `'{`.

- `works` remains unchanged.
- `res` now contains the characters from `'a'` to `'z'`, `'u'`, and now includes `'{`.
- `scount[25]` remains 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1, making it 27.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z', 'u', '{'; `scount[25]` is 0; `i` is 27**
