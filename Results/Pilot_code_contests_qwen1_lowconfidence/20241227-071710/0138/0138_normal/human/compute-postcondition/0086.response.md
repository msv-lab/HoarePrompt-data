The code sets `cando` to `True`. The value of `cando` was previously determined by a condition involving `scountcopy` and `j`, but now it is explicitly set to `True`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of a specific character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`, `allgreater` is False, `t` must either contain at least one character or be an empty list, `i` must be less than the length of `t` and non-negative, `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`, `cando` is `True`, `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')`.**
