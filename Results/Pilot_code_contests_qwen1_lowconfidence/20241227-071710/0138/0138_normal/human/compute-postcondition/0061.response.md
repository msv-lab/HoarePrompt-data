`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is 25 (since `scount[25]` was mentioned), the value of `scount[25]` is decreased by 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `t`.

Output State: **`scount[25]` is greater than 0; `t` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `chr(i + ord('a'))`**
