`t` is appended with a character generated by adding the ASCII value of 'a' to `i`. Since `i` is initially 0, the character added to `t` is 'a'. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is updated, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers, `allgreater` is True, `t` is ['a'], `i` is 0, and `scount[0] must be greater than 0`.

Output State: **`total` is updated, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers, `allgreater` is True, `t` is ['a'], `i` is 0, and `scount[0] must be greater than 0**.
