`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Since `scount[i]` must be at least 2 before the decrement, after the decrement, `scount[i]` will be at least 1. The values of `works` and `res` remain unchanged. The other information about `scount` being updated for the first `works` elements of `t` and having at least one element greater than 0 remains valid.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1)` and one additional element; `scount[i]` is at least 1; `scount` is updated for the first `works` elements of `t` and must have at least one element greater than 0.**
