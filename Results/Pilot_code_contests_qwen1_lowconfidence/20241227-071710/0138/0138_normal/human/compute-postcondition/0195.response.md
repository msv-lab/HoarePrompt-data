The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `i + ord('a')` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 26, the ASCII value of `chr(26 + ord('a'))` is `chr(31)`, which is the character 'u'.

Before the code execution:
- `works` is a non-negative integer
- `res` is a list containing the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z' repeated `scount[25]` times and one additional element (since `scount[25]` is 0, `res` contains 'a', 'b', ..., 'z')
- `scount[25]` is 0
- `i` is 26
- `scount[26]` is greater than 0

After the code execution:
- `res` will now contain all the characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'u'
- `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it
- `scount` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z', 'u'; `scount[25]` is 0; `i` is 26; `scount[26]` is greater than 0**
