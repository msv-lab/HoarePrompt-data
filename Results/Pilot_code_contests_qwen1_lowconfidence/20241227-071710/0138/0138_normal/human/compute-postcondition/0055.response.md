`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is 26, `scount[25]` (since indexing starts at 0) is decreased by 1. The value of `scount[25]` was greater than 0, so after decrementing, it will still be greater than 0 because even if it was 1 initially, it will now be 0 which is still greater than -1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is updated, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers, `allgreater` is True, `t` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and 'z', `i` is 26, `scount[25]` is 0**
