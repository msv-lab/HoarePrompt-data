Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `works` is a non-negative integer.
   - `res` contains at least `works` elements plus one new element.
   - `scount` is updated for the first `works` elements of `t` and must have at least one element greater than 0.
   - The element `scount[i]` is decremented by 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `scount[i] > 0`.

3. **Determining Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `scount[i]` must still be greater than 0.
   - We need to ensure that `scount[i]` remains greater than 0 after the decrement operation in the current iteration.

Given that `scount[i]` is decremented by 1, for the loop to continue, `scount[i]` must have been greater than 1 before the decrement.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `scount[i]` is at least 2 (so that after decrementing by 1, it is still greater than 0).

State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` contains at least `works` elements plus one new element; `scount` is updated for the first `works` elements of `t` and must have at least one element greater than 0; the element `scount[i]` is decremented by 1 and must be at least 2 before the decrement.**
