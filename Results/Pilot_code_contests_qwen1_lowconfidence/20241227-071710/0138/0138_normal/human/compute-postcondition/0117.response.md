Postcondition: ***`scountcopy` is a list of integers, `cando` is a boolean which remains `True` unless `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] == 0`, in which case it becomes `False`. `works` is set to `i` if `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] != 0`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + len(t)`.***
