Postcondition: ***`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1, `t[works]` is a valid character ('a' to 'z'), `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, `res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t` plus the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `scount[j] > 0`. `scount` is updated such that the count at the position corresponding to each element in `t[:works]` is decremented by 1. If `scount[j]` is not greater than 0, no additional elements are added to `res` and `scount` remains unchanged.***
