Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Before Loop:**
   - `works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1.
   - `res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t`.
   - `scount` is updated such that the count at the position corresponding to each element in `t[:works]` is decremented by 1.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs over the range starting from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 (inclusive).
   - Here, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` calculates the index in the alphabet for the character `t[works]`.

4. **Determine the Minimum Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to start, the calculated index must be within the valid range of 0 to 25.
   - Therefore, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than or equal to 25.

5. **Check the Validity of `t[works]`:**
   - Since `works` is an integer and `t` is a string, `t[works]` should be a valid character in the string `t`.
   - Additionally, `t[works]` must correspond to a letter in the alphabet (i.e., 'a' through 'z').

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `t[works]` is a valid letter ('a' to 'z').
   - We need to ensure that `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25.

### Final State Adjustment:

Given these considerations, we need to adjust the following states to ensure the loop can execute:
- `t[works]` should be a valid character ('a' to 'z').
- `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than or equal to 25.

### Final Answer:

State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1, `t[works]` is a valid character ('a' to 'z'), `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, `res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t`, `scount` is updated such that the count at the position corresponding to each element in `t[:works]` is decremented by 1.**
