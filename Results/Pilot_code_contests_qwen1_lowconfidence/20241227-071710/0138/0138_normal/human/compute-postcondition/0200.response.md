According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `scount[i]`. If `scount[i]` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 27, and `scount[27]` is -1.

Since `scount[27]` is -1, it means there are no occurrences of the 28th character in the list `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, `scount[27]` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `scount[27]`.

State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z', 'u', '{'; `scount[27]` must be greater than 0; `i` is 27**
