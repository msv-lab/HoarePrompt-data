The code appends the character corresponding to the value of `i + ord('a')` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is 25, `i + ord('a')` equals `25 + 97` (since `ord('a')` is 97), which results in the character `u`. Therefore, the list `res` will have one additional element, `u`.

The initial state of `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), 'z', 'z'` and one additional element. After appending `u`, the list remains unchanged except for the addition of `u`.

Since `scount[25]` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 25, these values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), 'z', 'z', 'u'`; `scount[25]` is greater than 0; `i` is 25**
