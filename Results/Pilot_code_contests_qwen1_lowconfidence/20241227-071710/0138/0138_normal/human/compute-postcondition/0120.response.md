The variable `cando` is set to `False`. The other variables (`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]`, `works`, and `j`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is False, `works` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged**
