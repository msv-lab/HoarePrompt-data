According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `works`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `works`. At the end of the last iteration, `works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` is undefined, and `res` is undefined.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `works` must still be an integer greater than 0.
- `t` remains undefined.
- `res` remains undefined.

State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `t` is undefined; `res` is undefined**
