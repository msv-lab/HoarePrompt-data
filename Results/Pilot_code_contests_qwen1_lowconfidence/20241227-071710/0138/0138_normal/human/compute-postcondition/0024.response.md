The line `allgreater = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `allgreater`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from an input string, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of a specific character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`, `allgreater` is False, `t` must either contain at least one character or be an empty list, `i` is 1**
