Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a list of characters.
   - `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of a specific character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`.
   - `allgreater` is False.
   - `t` must either contain at least one character or be an empty list.
   - `i` must be less than the length of `t` and non-negative.
   - `works` is -1.
   - `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`.
   - `cando` is `True` if `scountcopy[j] > 0`; otherwise, `cando` remains False.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to `25`.
   - For each `j`, it checks if `scountcopy[j] > 0` (i.e., `cando` is True).
   - If `cando` is True, some action is performed in the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we focus on how `j` changes.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be less than the length of `t` and non-negative.
   - The value of `j` will be incremented within the loop, but the specific increment is not provided. Therefore, we assume `j` is set to the next valid value within the range specified by the loop.
   - Since `j` starts from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` and goes up to `25`, the next possible value for `j` would be `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `j` needs to be set to the next value in the range, which is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')`.
   - All other conditions remain the same as they are not directly affected by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`s` is a list of characters, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of a specific character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`, `allgreater` is False, `t` must either contain at least one character or be an empty list, `i` must be less than the length of `t` and non-negative, `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount`, `cando` is `True` if `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] > 0`; otherwise, `cando` remains False, `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')`.**
