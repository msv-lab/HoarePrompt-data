Output State: **`scountcopy` is a list of integers, `cando` is True, and `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + len(t)`. If `scountcopy[j] > 0`, `cando` remains `True`. If the loop does not execute, `cando` remains `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Condition**:
   - The loop starts with `j` initialized to `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.
   - The loop iterates from `j` to `25` (inclusive).
   - The loop condition is based on the value of `scountcopy[j]`.

2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - For each iteration, if `scountcopy[j] > 0`, `cando` is set to `True`.
   - Since there is no `else` statement, the value of `cando` remains `True` as long as any `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.
   - The value of `j` increases by 1 in each iteration, up to `25`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes its iterations, `j` will be `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + len(t)` because `i` starts at 2 and increases by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `len(t)`.
   - If the loop executed at least once, `cando` will be `True`.
   - If the loop did not execute (i.e., all `scountcopy[j]` are 0 or negative), `cando` will remain `False`.

4. **No Change in `scountcopy`**:
   - The loop does not modify `scountcopy` except potentially setting `cando` to `True` if any `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0.
   - Once `cando` is set to `True`, it remains `True` unless the loop does not execute.

### Conclusion:
- **Final State**: `scountcopy` remains unchanged (except possibly setting `cando` to `True`), `cando` is `True` if the loop executed at least once, and `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + len(t)`.
- **No Execution State**: If the loop does not execute (`scountcopy[j] <= 0` for all `j`), `cando` remains `False`.
