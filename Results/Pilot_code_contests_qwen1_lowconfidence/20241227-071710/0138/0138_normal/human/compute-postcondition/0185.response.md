`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is 25, `scount[25]` is decreased by 1. The value of `works`, the content of `res`, the value of `scount` for indices other than 25, and the value of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), `z` and one additional element; `scount[25]` is `scount[25] - 1`; `i` is 25**
