Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `works` is a non-negative integer.
- `res` is a list containing the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., `chr(works - 1)`, 'z' repeated `scount[25]` times and one additional element.
- `scount[25]` is 0.
- `i` is 25.

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Range of the Loop**: The `range(26)` function generates numbers from 0 to 25 inclusive.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 25. This means the loop has just completed its 25th iteration.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 26.
4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: The loop condition `i < 26` must still be true. Since `i` is now 26, the condition fails, and the loop will not execute again.

### Adjusting the States
Given that the loop will not execute again due to the condition failing, we need to adjust the state accordingly:

- `i` will be 26 (since it increments by 1).
- `scount[25]` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affect `scount[25]`.
- `res` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affect `res`.

### Final State
State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., `chr(works - 1)`, 'z' repeated `scount[25]` times and one additional element; `scount[25]` is 0; `i` is 26**
