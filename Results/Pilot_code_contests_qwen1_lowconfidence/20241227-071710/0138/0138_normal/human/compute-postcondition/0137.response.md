Postcondition: ***`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is `i`, and `j` is 25. If `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if statement executes.***
