To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition step by step.

### Given Information:
- `scountcopy` is a list of integers.
- `cando` remains `True`.
- `j` is set to `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 2`.

The loop condition is:
```
for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop starts with `j = ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` and increments `j` until `j < 26`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: According to the given information, `j` is already set to `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 2`. This means the loop will start from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 2`.
3. **No Changes to Variables in the Loop Body**: The problem statement mentions that if `scountcopy[j] > 0`, no changes are made to `cando` and `scountcopy`. Otherwise, no changes are made either. Therefore, `cando` and `scountcopy` remain unchanged within the loop body.
4. **Next Iteration of the Loop**: For the loop to continue, `j` must increment until it reaches a value where `j >= 26`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `scountcopy` remains unchanged.
- `cando` remains `True`.
- Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, `j` will increase by 1 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` will be `j + 1`.

Given that `j` was initially set to `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 2`, the next value of `j` will be `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 3`.

### Final State:
- `scountcopy` remains the same.
- `cando` remains `True`.
- `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 3`.

State: **`scountcopy` is a list of integers, `cando` remains `True`, and `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 3`**.
