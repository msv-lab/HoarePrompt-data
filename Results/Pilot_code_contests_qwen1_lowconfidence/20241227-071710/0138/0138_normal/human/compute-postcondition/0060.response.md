`t` is a list containing one more element `chr(i + ord('a'))`. The original `t` contained one element, which was `chr(i + ord('a'))`. After appending `chr(i + ord('a'))` to `t`, the list `t` now contains two identical elements, each being `chr(i + ord('a'))`.

Output State: **`scount[25]` must be greater than 1, `t` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `chr(i + ord('a'))`**
