To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and analyze each variable and condition:

### Given States at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1.
- `t[works]` is a valid character ('a' to 'z').
- `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25.
- `res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t` plus the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `scount[j] > 0` for all `j` in the range, and `scount[j]` is decreased by 1 if `scount[j] > 0`, with `scount` being updated accordingly.
- The most internal loop or if statement is exited.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will iterate over the range starting from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` up to 25 (inclusive).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `j` starts from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `j < 26`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but it implies that `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 26.
   - Once `j` reaches 26, the loop will stop executing.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than 26.

### Updated States:
- `works` remains unchanged since the loop does not affect `works`.
- `t[works]` remains unchanged since the loop does not affect `t`.
- `scount` remains unchanged since the loop does not affect `scount`.
- `res` remains unchanged since the loop does not affect `res`.

Therefore, the only thing that changes is the value of `j`.

### New State:
State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1, `t[works]` is a valid character ('a' to 'z'), `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, `res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t` plus the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `scount[j] > 0` for all `j` in the range, and `scount[j]` is decreased by 1 if `scount[j] > 0`, with `scount` being updated accordingly, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and `j` is now `j + 1`.**

### Final State:
State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1, `t[works]` is a valid character ('a' to 'z'), `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, `res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t` plus the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `scount[j] > 0` for all `j` in the range, and `scount[j]` is decreased by 1 if `scount[j] > 0`, with `scount` being updated accordingly, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and `j` is now `j + 1`.**
