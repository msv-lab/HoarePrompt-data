According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `works`. For the loop to execute again, `works` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than or equal to 0. 

To determine the exact state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The variable `works` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
- The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Since `i` is used as the range in the for loop, it will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, if the loop needs to execute again, `i` will be 1 (assuming it started from 0).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect:
- `works` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` will be 1.

The initial condition that `works` is an integer not equal to -1 and must be greater than or equal to 0 remains unchanged for the next iteration as well.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than 0; `i` is 1**
