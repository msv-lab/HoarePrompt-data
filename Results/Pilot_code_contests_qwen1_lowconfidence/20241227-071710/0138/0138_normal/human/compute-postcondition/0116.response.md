The `break` statement is used to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. In this case, there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, so the `break` statement here does not change any variables but indicates that execution would exit the nearest loop or conditional block.

The output state remains the same as the initial state since no variables are updated by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`scountcopy` is a list of integers, `cando` is True, `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + len(t)`, and `works` is `i`.**
