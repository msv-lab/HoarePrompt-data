The code snippet `res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))` appends a character to the list `res`. Here, `chr(i + ord('a'))` converts the integer `i` plus the ASCII value of `'a'` into a corresponding character.

Given the initial state:
- `works` is a non-negative integer.
- `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), 'z'` and one additional element.
- `scount[25]` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 25.

Let's calculate the character that will be appended to `res`:
- `i` is 25.
- `ord('a')` is 97.
- `i + ord('a')` is `25 + 97`, which equals 122.
- `chr(122)` is the character `'z'`.

Since `i` is 25, the character `'z'` will be appended to the list `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), 'z', 'z'` and one additional element; `scount[25]` must be greater than 0; `i` is 25**
