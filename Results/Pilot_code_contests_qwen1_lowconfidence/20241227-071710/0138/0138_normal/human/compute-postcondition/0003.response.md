`tcount` is initialized as a list of 26 zeros using `[0] * 26`. This operation does not affect the values of `scount`, `s`, or `t`. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `tcount` and retain the initial values of `scount`, `s`, and `t`.

Output State: **`scount` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `tcount` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `t` is a list of characters from the user's input**
