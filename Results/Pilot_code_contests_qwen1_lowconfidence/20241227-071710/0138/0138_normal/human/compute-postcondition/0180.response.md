`scount[i]` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `scount[i]` is greater than 0, so it becomes `scount[i] - 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1)` and one additional element, plus the new character `chr(i + ord('a'))`; `scount[i]` is now `scount[i] - 1`**
