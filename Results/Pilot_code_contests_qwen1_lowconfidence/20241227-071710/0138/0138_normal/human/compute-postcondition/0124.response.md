Postcondition: ***`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is unchanged, `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`, and `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0. If `scountcopy[j]` is not greater than 0, then `cando` remains False, `works` is unchanged, and `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.***
