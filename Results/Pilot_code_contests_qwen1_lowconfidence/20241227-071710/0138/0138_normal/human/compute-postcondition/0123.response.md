The code sets `cando` to `True`. This changes the value of `cando`, but leaves the other variables unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `cando` being set to `True`.

Output State: **`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is unchanged, `j` is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`, `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0**
