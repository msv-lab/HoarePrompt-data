`scount[i]` is decremented by 1, where `i` is 25. Since `scount[25]` was initially greater than 0, it will now be reduced by 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`works` is a non-negative integer; `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), 'z', 'z', 'u'`; `scount[25]` is greater than 1; `i` is 25**
