To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions required for the loop to continue.

1. **Initial State at End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `works` is a non-negative integer.
   - `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), 'z', 'z'` and one additional element.
   - `scount[25]` is `scount[25] - 1`.
   - `i` is 25.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `scount[i] > 0`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 25.
   - `scount[25]` has already been decremented by 1 in the previous iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `scount[i]` (specifically `scount[25]`) must be greater than 0. Since `scount[25]` was decremented in the previous iteration, it means that before decrementing, `scount[25]` must have been at least 1. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, `scount[25]` must be reset to a value of 1 or higher.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

- **`scount[25]`:** This must be set back to a value such that it is greater than 0. Since it was decremented once, it must be set to at least 1.

No other states need adjustment based on the provided information.

### Final Answer:
State: **`works` is a non-negative integer, `res` is a list containing the characters `a, b, c, ..., chr(works - 1), 'z', 'z'` and one additional element, `scount[25]` must be greater than 0, `i` is 25**.
