The code snippet `res.append(t[i])` tries to append an element from the list `t` at index `i` to the list `res`. However, there is no definition or initialization of the list `t` in the given code snippet, and the index `i` is also not defined. Given the initial state, `works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than or equal to 0; `res` is an empty list, we cannot proceed without knowing the value of `i` and the contents of `t`.

Since the exact values are not provided, we can only state that `res` will have its original content (an empty list) unless the list `t` is defined and `i` is a valid index for `t`. Therefore, based on the information given, the output state remains the same as the initial state because the code snippet cannot be executed properly due to missing definitions.

Output State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than or equal to 0; `res` is an empty list**
