The code `res.append(t[i])` attempts to append the value of `t[i]` to the list `res`. However, there is an issue here because `t` is undefined, meaning there is no list `t` to access. As a result, this line of code will raise a `NameError`.

Given that the code raises an error and does not modify any of the existing variables (`works`, `i`, `t`, `res`), the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1 and must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `t` is undefined; `res` is undefined**
