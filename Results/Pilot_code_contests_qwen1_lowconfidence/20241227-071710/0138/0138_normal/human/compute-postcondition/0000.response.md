`s` is converted from a string to a list of characters using the `list(raw_input())` function, which means each character in the original string `s` is now an element in the list. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, with lengths satisfying 1 ≤ |s|, |t| ≤ 5000.**
