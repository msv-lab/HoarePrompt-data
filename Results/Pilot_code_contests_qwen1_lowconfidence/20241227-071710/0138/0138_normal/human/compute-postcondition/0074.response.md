Output State: **`total` is updated, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers, `allgreater` is False, `t` is a list containing all characters from 'a' to 'z' each appearing `scount[i]` times where `i` is the index of the letter in the alphabet, `i` is 26, `scount` is a list of 26 zeros, indicating all counts have been exhausted.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `scount` is updated such that the count of each character in `s` is decreased by the number of times that character appears in `t`.
   - `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of a specific character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`.
   - `allgreater` is initially True, indicating that all counts in `scount` were initially greater than zero.
   - `t` must contain at least one character, and `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character from 'a' to 'z' (26 iterations).
   - For each iteration (`i`), the `while` loop continues as long as `scount[i]` is greater than 0.
   - During each iteration, `chr(i + ord('a'))` is appended to `t`, and `scount[i]` is decremented by 1.
   - This process continues until `scount[i]` becomes 0 for all `i`.

3. **Final State After Loop Executes All Iterations**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be 26 because all characters from 'a' to 'z' have been processed.
   - `scount` will be a list of 26 zeros, indicating that all counts have been exhausted.
   - `t` will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' each appearing `scount[i]` times where `i` is the index of the letter in the alphabet.
   - Since all counts in `scount` have been reduced to 0, `allgreater` will be False.

4. **If the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `tcount` is empty or `tcount` does not contain any character counts (indicating no characters in `s`), the loop will not execute at all.
   - In this case, `t` will be an empty list, `scount` will remain unchanged, and `allgreater` will remain True.

This final state ensures that all characters in `s` have been processed and their counts have been updated accordingly in `t`.
