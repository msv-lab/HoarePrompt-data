The code snippet appends a character to the list `res`. The character appended is determined by converting the index `j` to a character using the formula `chr(j + ord('a'))`.

- `res` was initially a list containing the first `works` elements of `t`.
- `j` is an index for which `scount[j]` is greater than 0.
- Appending `chr(j + ord('a'))` to `res` means the new value of `res` will be the previous `res` plus the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`.

Therefore, the updated state of `res` is the concatenation of its previous elements and the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`.

Output State: **`works` is an integer with a value not equal to -1, `t[works]` is a valid character ('a' to 'z'), `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` is less than or equal to 25, `res` is a list containing the first `works` elements of `t` plus the character `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `scount` is updated such that the count at the position corresponding to each element in `t[:works]` is decremented by 1, and `j` is an index for which `scount[j]` is greater than 0.**
