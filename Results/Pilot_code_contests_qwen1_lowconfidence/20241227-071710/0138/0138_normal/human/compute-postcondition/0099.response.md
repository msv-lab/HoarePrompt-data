Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved**: The key variables are `s`, `tcount`, `allgreater`, `t`, `i`, `works`, `scountcopy`, and `cando`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `s`. The loop condition is based on `i` being within the range of `len(s)`.

3. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `s` is a list of characters.
   - `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`.
   - `allgreater` is `False`.
   - `t` must either contain at least one character or be an empty list.
   - `i` is 1 (the length of `t`).
   - `works` is the number of times the loop has executed (which is equal to the number of times `cando` was set to `True`).
   - `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` where the count of character `t[0]` (which is 'b') is decremented by 1.
   - `cando` is `False` after the if condition is evaluated and potentially exited.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will check if `i` is less than `len(s)`.
   - If `i` is less than `len(s)`, the loop will execute again. After executing, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `scountcopy` remains unchanged unless there is an operation inside the loop that modifies it, but no such operation is mentioned in the problem statement.
   - `cando` is still `False` as it was set in the previous iteration and the loop did not exit.

Given the analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `s` is a list of characters, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of a specific character ('a' to 'z') in the input string `s`, `allgreater` is `False`, `t` must either contain at least one character or be an empty list, `i` is 2 (the length of `t`), `works` is the number of times the loop has executed (which is equal to the number of times `cando` was set to `True`), `scountcopy` is a copy of `scount` where the count of character `t[0]` (which is 'b') is decremented by 1, and `cando` is `False` after the if condition is evaluated and potentially exited.**
