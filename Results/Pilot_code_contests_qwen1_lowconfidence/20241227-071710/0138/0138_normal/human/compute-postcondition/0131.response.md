Output State: **`scountcopy[ord(t[i + 1]) - ord('a')]` is decreased by 1, `cando` is True, `works` is unchanged, and `j` is 25 (the last possible index in the `scountcopy` array). If `scountcopy[j]` is not greater than 0 for any `j` in the range (`ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25), then `cando` remains False, `works` is unchanged, and `j` is 25.**
