The function compares the frequency of characters in two input strings, `s` and `t`. It then checks if every character in `s` appears at least as many times as in `t`. If `s` and `t` have the same length and this condition is met, it returns -1. Otherwise, it constructs a string where each character from 'a' to 'z' appears a number of times equal to the minimum between its frequency in `s` and `t`. In case `s` cannot be transformed to match `t` by reducing frequencies, it returns -1.
