Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the code fails to handle cases where the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` that is strictly greater than `t` does not exist. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not properly check whether a valid permutation exists that satisfies the conditions. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   abad
   bob
   ```
   The correct output should be `daab`, but the code incorrectly returns `-1`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Result**: The logic for constructing the result string `res` is flawed. The code attempts to find the first character that can be swapped to make the string greater than `t` but does not ensure that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest permutation greater than `t`.

3. **Failing to Handle All Possible Scenarios**: The code does not account for scenarios where no valid permutation exists. For instance, in the input:
   ```
   abc
   defg
   ```
   The correct output should be `-1`, but the code incorrectly returns `abczaa`.

To fix these issues, the code needs to ensure that it finds the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` that is strictly greater than `t`. This involves carefully constructing the result string by ensuring that the first differing character is increased while maintaining the rest of the string in the smallest possible form.
