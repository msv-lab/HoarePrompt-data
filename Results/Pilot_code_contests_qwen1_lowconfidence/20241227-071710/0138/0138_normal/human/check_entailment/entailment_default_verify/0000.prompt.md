You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everything got unclear to us in a far away constellation Tau Ceti. Specifically, the Taucetians choose names to their children in a very peculiar manner.

Two young parents abac and bbad think what name to give to their first-born child. They decided that the name will be the permutation of letters of string s. To keep up with the neighbours, they decided to call the baby so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than the neighbour's son's name t.

On the other hand, they suspect that a name tax will be introduced shortly. According to it, the Taucetians with lexicographically larger names will pay larger taxes. That's the reason abac and bbad want to call the newborn so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than name t and lexicographically minimum at that.

The lexicographical order of strings is the order we are all used to, the "dictionary" order. Such comparison is used in all modern programming languages to compare strings. Formally, a string p of length n is lexicographically less than string q of length m, if one of the two statements is correct:

  * n < m, and p is the beginning (prefix) of string q (for example, "aba" is less than string "abaa"), 
  * p1 = q1, p2 = q2, ..., pk - 1 = qk - 1, pk < qk for some k (1 ≤ k ≤ min(n, m)), here characters in strings are numbered starting from 1. 



Write a program that, given string s and the heighbours' child's name t determines the string that is the result of permutation of letters in s. The string should be lexicographically strictly more than t and also, lexicographically minimum.

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000), where |s| is its length. The second line contains a non-empty string t (1 ≤ |t| ≤ 5000), where |t| is its length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print the sought name or -1 if it doesn't exist.

Examples

Input

aad
aac


Output

aad


Input

abad
bob


Output

daab


Input

abc
defg


Output

-1


Input

czaaab
abcdef


Output

abczaa

Note

In the first sample the given string s is the sought one, consequently, we do not need to change the letter order there.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it constructs the lexicographically smallest string that is strictly greater than `t`. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the constructed string is indeed the lexicographically smallest possible string that satisfies the condition.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this issue:

### Example Input:
```
s = "abc"
t = "abc"
```

### Expected Output:
The expected output is `-1` because no permutation of `s` can be lexicographically greater than `t`.

### Program Output:
However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. It attempts to find a position in `s` where a character can be swapped to make the resulting string greater than `t`. In this specific case, the program will incorrectly return a valid permutation instead of `-1`.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Initial Checks**: The program first checks if `s` is already greater than `t` or if all characters in `s` are greater than or equal to the corresponding characters in `t`. If so, it returns `-1` if lengths are equal.
2. **Finding the Position**: It then tries to find a position in `s` where a character can be swapped to make the string greater than `t`.
3. **Constructing the Result**: The program constructs the result by ensuring that the new character is chosen such that the resulting string is lexicographically smaller but still greater than `t`.

### Issue:
For the input `s = "abc"` and `t = "abc"`, the program will fail to recognize that no valid permutation exists and will incorrectly return a valid permutation like `"acb"`.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `t` can be formed. If not, it should return `-1`.

### Suggested Fix:
The program should include an additional check after finding the position to ensure that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest one. Here is a simplified version of how this could be implemented:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(input().strip())
    t = list(input().strip())
    scount = [0] * 26
    tcount = [0] * 26
    for char in s:
        scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    for char in t:
        tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    
    # Check if s is already greater than t or if no valid permutation exists
    if s == sorted(t) or s == t:
        return -1

    allgreater = True
    for i in range(26):
        if scount[i] < tcount[i]:
            allgreater = False
    if allgreater:
        if len(s) == len(t):
            return -1
        for char in t:
            scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
        for i in range(26):
            while scount[i] > 0:
                t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
                scount[i] -= 1
        return ''.join(map(str, t))

    works = -1
    scountcopy = list(scount)
    for i in range(len(s)):
        cando = False
        for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
            if scountcopy[j] > 0:
                cando = True
        if cando:
            works = i
        if scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] == 0:
            break
        scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1

    if works == -1:
        return -1
    res = list()
    for i in range(works):
        res.append(t[i])
        scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
    for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
        if scount[j] > 0:
            res.append(chr(j + ord('a')))
            scount[j] -= 1
            break
    for i in range(26):
        while scount[i] > 0:
            res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
            scount[i] -= 1
    return ''.join(map(str, res))

print(func_1())
```

This ensures that the program correctly identifies cases where no valid permutation exists.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function compares the frequency of characters in two input strings, `s` and `t`. It then checks if every character in `s` appears at least as many times as in `t`. If `s` and `t` have the same length and this condition is met, it returns -1. Otherwise, it constructs a string where each character from 'a' to 'z' appears a number of times equal to the minimum between its frequency in `s` and `t`. In case `s` cannot be transformed to match `t` by reducing frequencies, it returns -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
