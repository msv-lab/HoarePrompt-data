Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program has logical flaws in handling certain edge cases, particularly when constructing the lexicographically smallest string that is strictly greater than `t`. As discussed, the program does not correctly identify cases where no valid permutation exists, leading to incorrect outputs. For example, in the case where `s = "abc"` and `t = "abc"`, the program incorrectly returns a valid permutation instead of `-1`. This is a critical flaw that affects the overall correctness of the program.
