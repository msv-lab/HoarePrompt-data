Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Based on the provided annotated version of the code, the program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically, the program fails to find the lexicographically smallest string that is strictly greater than `t` when `s` is lexicographically greater than `t`.

Let's examine the critical part of the code:
```python
if allgreater:
    if (len(s) == len(t)):
        return -1
    for char in t:
        scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
    for i in range(26):
        while scount[i] > 0:
            t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
            scount[i] -= 1
    return ''.join(map(str, t))
```

This section handles the case where `s` is already lexicographically greater than `t`. Here, it tries to form a new string `t` using the remaining characters in `s` to be lexicographically smaller than `s` but larger than `t`. However, it does not guarantee that the resulting string will be the lexicographically smallest string greater than `t`.

For instance, consider the input:
```
aad
aac
```
The expected output is `"aad"`, but the program incorrectly outputs `''` (an empty string). The annotated version confirms that the program fails to correctly identify and use the lexicographically smallest character that can make the resulting string greater than `t`.

Another critical issue is in the handling of the `works` variable:
```python
if (works == -1) :
    return -1
res = list()
for i in range(works):
    res.append(t[i])
    scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
```
This section is supposed to build the resulting string `res` by ensuring it is lexicographically smaller than `s` but larger than `t`. However, the logic here is flawed, and the program does not guarantee that `res` will be the lexicographically smallest string greater than `t`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and does not meet the problem description. Thus, the original assessment of **False** is accurate.
