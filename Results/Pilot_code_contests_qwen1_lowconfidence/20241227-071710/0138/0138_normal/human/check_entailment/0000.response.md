Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it constructs the lexicographically smallest string that is strictly greater than `t`. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the constructed string is indeed the lexicographically smallest possible string that satisfies the condition.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this issue:

### Example Input:
```
s = "abc"
t = "abc"
```

### Expected Output:
The expected output is `-1` because no permutation of `s` can be lexicographically greater than `t`.

### Program Output:
However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. It attempts to find a position in `s` where a character can be swapped to make the resulting string greater than `t`. In this specific case, the program will incorrectly return a valid permutation instead of `-1`.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Initial Checks**: The program first checks if `s` is already greater than `t` or if all characters in `s` are greater than or equal to the corresponding characters in `t`. If so, it returns `-1` if lengths are equal.
2. **Finding the Position**: It then tries to find a position in `s` where a character can be swapped to make the string greater than `t`.
3. **Constructing the Result**: The program constructs the result by ensuring that the new character is chosen such that the resulting string is lexicographically smaller but still greater than `t`.

### Issue:
For the input `s = "abc"` and `t = "abc"`, the program will fail to recognize that no valid permutation exists and will incorrectly return a valid permutation like `"acb"`.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check if the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `t` can be formed. If not, it should return `-1`.

### Suggested Fix:
The program should include an additional check after finding the position to ensure that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest one. Here is a simplified version of how this could be implemented:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(input().strip())
    t = list(input().strip())
    scount = [0] * 26
    tcount = [0] * 26
    for char in s:
        scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    for char in t:
        tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    
    # Check if s is already greater than t or if no valid permutation exists
    if s == sorted(t) or s == t:
        return -1

    allgreater = True
    for i in range(26):
        if scount[i] < tcount[i]:
            allgreater = False
    if allgreater:
        if len(s) == len(t):
            return -1
        for char in t:
            scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
        for i in range(26):
            while scount[i] > 0:
                t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
                scount[i] -= 1
        return ''.join(map(str, t))

    works = -1
    scountcopy = list(scount)
    for i in range(len(s)):
        cando = False
        for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
            if scountcopy[j] > 0:
                cando = True
        if cando:
            works = i
        if scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] == 0:
            break
        scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1

    if works == -1:
        return -1
    res = list()
    for i in range(works):
        res.append(t[i])
        scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
    for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
        if scount[j] > 0:
            res.append(chr(j + ord('a')))
            scount[j] -= 1
            break
    for i in range(26):
        while scount[i] > 0:
            res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
            scount[i] -= 1
    return ''.join(map(str, res))

print(func_1())
```

This ensures that the program correctly identifies cases where no valid permutation exists.
