Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the following input:

Input:
```
aad
aac
```

Expected Output:
```
aad
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs `''` (an empty string).

The issue lies in the way the program handles the case where `s` is lexicographically greater than `t` but needs to form the lexicographically smallest string greater than `t`. The program does not correctly identify and use the lexicographically smallest character that can make the resulting string greater than `t`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after identifying the position `works`, it should insert the smallest possible character greater than `t[works]` in the resulting string. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to incorrect outputs in certain cases.
