None of the variables' descriptions or relationships are provided within the given function signature. However, based on the context and typical usage, we can infer that `func_2` is expected to read input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer d. The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of d for each test case.
