The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program will have received an integer value from the user as input. This integer value can be any valid integer that the user enters. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, which would result in an error since the `int()` function will raise a `ValueError`. In such cases, the function may need to handle exceptions to ensure robust behavior.
