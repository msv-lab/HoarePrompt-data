The function `func_3` takes no parameters and prompts the user to input a string `s` that ends with a non-digit character. It then returns a list of characters representing the integer part of `s`, excluding the last character. The function ensures that the returned list contains only the digits that form the integer part of the input string, effectively removing the trailing non-digit character.
