The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers. It then converts this sequence into a list of integers and returns it. This process handles multiple test cases, where each test case is a single line of input containing one or more integers separated by spaces. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that the input is well-formed and each line contains at least one integer. If the input is empty or improperly formatted (e.g., contains non-integer values), the function will still attempt to convert the input, potentially leading to ValueError exceptions, which are not caught within the provided code.
