Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10000\), \(n > 3\), \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, \(n \geq 25\), and for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\), and \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\). If `n` is divisible by any number \(i\) or \(i + 2\), the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (no change in state).***
