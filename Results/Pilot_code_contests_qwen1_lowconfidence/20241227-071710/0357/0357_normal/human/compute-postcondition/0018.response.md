The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer with several conditions. The code snippet increments `i` by 6. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, and the condition on `n` does not involve `i`. Therefore, after executing `i += 6`, the value of `i` is updated by adding 6 to its original value, but the value of `n` remains unchanged as per the given conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10000\), \(n > 3\), \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, \(n \geq 25\), and for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\), and \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\); `i` is increased by 6.**
