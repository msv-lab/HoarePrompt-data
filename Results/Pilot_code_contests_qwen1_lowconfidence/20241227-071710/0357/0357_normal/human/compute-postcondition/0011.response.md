The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. The output provided does not specify a return value directly but mentions conditions that could lead to different outputs. However, based on the given constraints and the need to describe the functionality, we can infer that the function might be checking some property related to the list of prime numbers and the integer `d`.

Since there are no parameters mentioned in the function definition, the description should reflect that. The output conditions can be described as cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns based on the following conditions:**
- Case_1: The function checks if `d` is within the range [1, 10000]. If `d` is not within this range, it returns an appropriate message or value.
- Case_2: If `d` is within the range [1, 10000], the function further checks properties related to the list of prime numbers (though specific properties are not detailed in the provided information).
