Let's analyze the given conditions and the while loop step by step.

### Given Conditions:
1. \(1 < n \leq 10000\)
2. \(n > 3\)
3. \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and \(n\) is not divisible by 3
4. \(n\) must be at least 25
5. For all integers \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\)
6. \(i\) is increased by 6 at the end of each iteration

### While Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `i * i <= n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - \(n\) is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10000\), \(n > 3\), \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, \(n \geq 25\), and for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\).
   - \(i\) is increased by 6 after each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as \(i * i \leq n\).

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \(i * i\) must still be less than or equal to \(n\).
   - Since \(i\) is increased by 6 in each iteration, we need to check if \((i + 6) * (i + 6) \leq n\).

### Calculation:
- Let \(i_k\) be the value of \(i\) at the start of the current iteration.
- After the current iteration, \(i\) becomes \(i_{k+1} = i_k + 6\).
- The loop condition for the next iteration is \((i_{k+1})^2 \leq n\).

To ensure the loop executes one more time:
\[ (i_k + 6)^2 \leq n \]

Given that \(i_k^2 \leq n\) at the end of the previous iteration, we need to find the new \(i_{k+1}\) such that \((i_{k+1})^2 \leq n\).

### Conclusion:
- We do not need to adjust any specific state directly related to \(n\), but we need to ensure that \(i\) can still satisfy the loop condition in the next iteration.

Thus, the only state that needs to be considered is the updated value of \(i\):
- \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\).

### Final Answer:
State: **\(n\) is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10000\), \(n > 3\), \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, \(n \geq 25\), and for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\), and \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\)**.
