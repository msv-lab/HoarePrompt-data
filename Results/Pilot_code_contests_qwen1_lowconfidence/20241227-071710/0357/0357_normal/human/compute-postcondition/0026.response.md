Functionality: **The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 10000. It checks whether `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3. Specifically, the function follows these steps:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is even or divisible by 3, it returns `False`.
4. For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks divisibility starting from 5 up to the square root of `n`, incrementing by 6 each time (checking `i` and `i + 2`).
5. If no divisors are found during the check, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `n` is 1 or 2, the function correctly returns `False` and `True` respectively, which is consistent with the annotations.
- When `n` is 3, the function also correctly returns `True`.
- For even numbers and multiples of 3, the function correctly returns `False`.
- For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, the function correctly returns `True` if no divisors are found up to the square root of `n`.

The function does not explicitly handle the case when `n` is a perfect square. While the loop condition `i * i <= n` ensures that the loop terminates before checking numbers greater than the square root of `n`, it does not guarantee that the loop covers all numbers up to the square root of `n` if `n` is a perfect square. However, since the function correctly handles non-perfect squares, and the condition `i * i <= n` is sufficient for the given range, this can be considered an implicit edge case rather than a missing functionality.**

In summary, the function `func_7` determines if `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, returning `True` if so, and `False` otherwise.
