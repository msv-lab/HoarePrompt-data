`i` is incremented by 6, but the exact initial value of `i` is not specified. However, the precondition states that for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\), and \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\). Since the value of `i` is increased by 6, the new value of `i` is still within the range and satisfies the conditions. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10000\), \(n > 3\), \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, \(n \geq 25\), and for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\), and \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\); `i` is `i` + 6.**
