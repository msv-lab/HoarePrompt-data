`j` is increased by 1 (since `j += 1` increments `j` by 1). The condition `primes[j+1] - primes[i] < d` is not affected by the increment of `j`. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is increased by 1; `primes[j+1] - primes[i] < d`.

Output State: **`j` is increased by 1; `primes[j+1] - primes[i] < d`**
