Let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Conditions:
1. \(1 < n \leq 10000\)
2. \(n > 3\)
3. \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3
4. \(n \geq 25\)
5. For all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\)
6. \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\)

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while i * i <= n:`

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n\).
- We need to find the current value of \(i\) and adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- \(n\) is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10000\), \(n > 3\), \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, \(n \geq 25\), and for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\), and \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\).
- \(i\) is increased by 6 in each iteration.

### Determining the Next Value of \(i\):
- Since \(i\) is increased by 6 in each iteration, we need to find the next value of \(i\) such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Identify the current value of \(i\).
2. Ensure that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\).
3. If \((i + 6)^2 > n\), then the loop cannot continue, and we need to adjust \(i\) to ensure the next iteration satisfies the condition.

Given the constraints, we need to ensure that the loop condition \(i^2 \leq n\) holds true for the next iteration. This means:

- \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\) and \(i + 6\) must still satisfy the loop condition.

### State Adjustment:
- We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. This means we need to ensure that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\).

### Final State:
- Adjust \(i\) to \(i + 6\) such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\).

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10000\), \(n > 3\), \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, \(n \geq 25\), and for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\), and \(i\) must be such that \((i + 6)^2 \leq n\), and \(i\) is increased by 6**.

This ensures that the loop condition \(i^2 \leq n\) holds true for the next iteration.
