The code `i = func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)[1]` does the following:
- `d + 1` is calculated, which means `d` is incremented by 1.
- `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` is called with the arguments being the list of prime numbers, `d + 1`, 0, and the last index of the primes list.
- The function returns a tuple, and the second element of this tuple is assigned to `i`.

Given the initial state where `primes` is a list of prime numbers and `d` is the return value of `func_1()`, the output state will be:
- `d` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is assigned the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`primes` is a list of prime numbers, `d` is the return value of `func_1()` + 1, and `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d, 0, len(primes) - 1)`.**
