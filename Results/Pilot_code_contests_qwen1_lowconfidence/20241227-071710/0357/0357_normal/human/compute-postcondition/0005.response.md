Let's analyze the given situation step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The variable `j` has been increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `primes[j] - primes[i] < d`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` must be true.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure that the condition `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` holds true in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` has already been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `primes[j]` is such that `primes[j] - primes[i] < d` is still true in the next iteration.
   - This means that `primes[j+1] - primes[i]` should be less than `d` for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that `primes[j+1] - primes[i] < d` holds true in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` is increased by 1 (this is already given).
- Ensure that `primes[j+1] - primes[i] < d` for the next iteration.

The final state can be represented as:
State: **`j` is increased by 1 and `primes[j+1] - primes[i] < d`**
