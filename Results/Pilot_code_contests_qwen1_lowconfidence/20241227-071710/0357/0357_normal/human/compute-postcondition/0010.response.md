The code `print(primes[i] * primes[j])` does not change any variables but prints the product of `primes[i]` and `primes[j]`. Since the values of `primes[i]` and `primes[j]` are determined by the initial state and do not change within the scope of this code snippet, the only effect is the print statement.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d, 0, len(primes) - 1)`
- `j` is `i` + the number of times the loop executed
- `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`

After executing the print statement, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the value of `primes[i] * primes[j]` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i` + the number of times the loop executed, and the value of `primes[i] * primes[j]` is printed.**
