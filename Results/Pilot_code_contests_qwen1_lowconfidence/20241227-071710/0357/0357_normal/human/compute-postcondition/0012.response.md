Functionality: **The function `func_9` takes no explicit parameters and returns nothing. It first calls `func_1()` to get an integer `d`. Then, it uses `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` to find a pair of indices `i` and `j` in the list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between the `j`-th and `i`-th prime numbers is at least `d`. After the loop, it prints the product of these two prime numbers. If no such pair is found, the loop will continue until the end of the list, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
1. If `func_8` does not find a valid pair of indices within the range of the list, the loop will continue to execute and may eventually cause an out-of-range error if `j` exceeds the length of `primes`.
2. The function assumes that `func_8` always returns a valid tuple. If `func_8` fails to return a tuple or returns invalid indices, the function may behave unexpectedly.
3. The function does not handle cases where `d` is larger than the difference between the largest and smallest elements in `primes`. In such cases, the loop might run indefinitely or produce incorrect results.
