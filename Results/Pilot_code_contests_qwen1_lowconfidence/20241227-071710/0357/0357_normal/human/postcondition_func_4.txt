The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing test cases and a separator `sep`. It then joins the elements of the list `l` into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by the value of `sep`. If `sep` is not specified or is of a type other than a string, the function will still attempt to join the list using `sep`, resulting in potentially undefined behavior. After processing, the function prints the joined string and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the joined string is printed to the console.
