You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.
Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time
    start_time = int(round(time() * 1000))
    input = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').readline
    readAll = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').read
    sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[2], 'w')
else:
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    readAll = sys.stdin.read
p = [False] * 21001
for i in xrange(1, 21001):
    p[i] = func_7(i)
primes = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(p) if x]
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in xrange(func_1()):
        func_9()
    if testing:
        sys.stdout = cmd
        print(int(round(time() * 1000)) - start_time)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program will have received an integer value from the user as input. This integer value can be any valid integer that the user enters. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, which would result in an error since the `int()` function will raise a `ValueError`. In such cases, the function may need to handle exceptions to ensure robust behavior.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers. It then converts this sequence into a list of integers and returns it. This process handles multiple test cases, where each test case is a single line of input containing one or more integers separated by spaces. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that the input is well-formed and each line contains at least one integer. If the input is empty or improperly formatted (e.g., contains non-integer values), the function will still attempt to convert the input, potentially leading to ValueError exceptions, which are not caught within the provided code.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` takes no parameters and prompts the user to input a string `s` that ends with a non-digit character. It then returns a list of characters representing the integer part of `s`, excluding the last character. The function ensures that the returned list contains only the digits that form the integer part of the input string, effectively removing the trailing non-digit character.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a single string parameter `s`, which is expected to end with a non-digit character following a sequence of digits. The function returns a substring of `s` that excludes the last character. If `s` consists solely of digits or is empty, the function will still remove the last character (if present), potentially returning an empty string. If `s` ends with a digit and no non-digit character follows, the function will only return the digits without the trailing digit.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l, sep=' '):
    print(sep.join(map(str, l)))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing test cases and a separator `sep`. It then joins the elements of the list `l` into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by the value of `sep`. If `sep` is not specified or is of a type other than a string, the function will still attempt to join the list using `sep`, resulting in potentially undefined behavior. After processing, the function prints the joined string and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the joined string is printed to the console.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(n):
    i = 1
    sq_n = n ** 0.5
    divs = []
    while i <= sq_n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if n / i != i:
                divs.append(n / i)
        i = i + 1
    return sorted(divs)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a positive integer `n` as a parameter. It calculates all divisors of `n`, including both the divisors and their corresponding quotients when `n` is divided by them. The function then stores these divisors in a list, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the only divisor is 1 itself) or when `n` is a prime number (the only divisors are 1 and `n`). The function handles these cases correctly by ensuring that each unique divisor is added to the list exactly once and sorting the final list.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 10000. It checks whether `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3. Specifically, the function follows these steps:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is even or divisible by 3, it returns `False`.
4. For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks divisibility starting from 5 up to the square root of `n`, incrementing by 6 each time (checking `i` and `i + 2`).
5. If no divisors are found during the check, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `n` is 1 or 2, the function correctly returns `False` and `True` respectively, which is consistent with the annotations.
- When `n` is 3, the function also correctly returns `True`.
- For even numbers and multiples of 3, the function correctly returns `False`.
- For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, the function correctly returns `True` if no divisors are found up to the square root of `n`.

The function does not explicitly handle the case when `n` is a perfect square. While the loop condition `i * i <= n` ensures that the loop terminates before checking numbers greater than the square root of `n`, it does not guarantee that the loop covers all numbers up to the square root of `n` if `n` is a perfect square. However, since the function correctly handles non-perfect squares, and the condition `i * i <= n` is sufficient for the given range, this can be considered an implicit edge case rather than a missing functionality.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(arr, x, low, high):
    if high >= low:
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return (mid, mid)
        elif arr[mid] > x:
            return func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return func_8(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
    else:
        return (high, low)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in ascending order, an integer `x` to search for, and two integers `low` and `high` representing the current search range within the list. It performs a binary search to find the index of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns the index `mid` twice. If `x` is not found, it continues the search in the appropriate half of the list by adjusting the `low` and `high` values. If the search range becomes invalid (i.e., `high < low`), it returns the values of `high` and `low`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality included:
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is found, returning `mid` twice.
- The function correctly adjusts the search range based on whether `x` is less than or greater than `arr[mid]`.
- The function correctly returns `high` and `low` when the search range is invalid (i.e., `high < low`).
- However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `x` is not found within the search range, although this is implied by the return of `high` and `low` when the range is invalid.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    d = func_1()
    i = func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)[1]
    j = i + 1
    while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
        j += 1
    print(primes[i] * primes[j])
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` takes no explicit parameters and returns nothing. It first calls `func_1()` to get an integer `d`. Then, it uses `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` to find a pair of indices `i` and `j` in the list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between the `j`-th and `i`-th prime numbers is at least `d`. After the loop, it prints the product of these two prime numbers. If no such pair is found, the loop will continue until the end of the list, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
