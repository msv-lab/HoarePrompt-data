Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_9` aims to find the smallest positive integer \(a\) that has at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least \(d\). However, the function does not correctly compute the smallest such integer \(a\).

Let's analyze the key part of `func_9`:

```python
i = func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)[1]
j = i + 1
while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
    j += 1
print(primes[i] * primes[j])
```

Here, `func_8` is used to find two prime numbers \(p_i\) and \(p_j\) such that \(p_j - p_i \geq d\). The code then multiplies these two prime numbers to get \(a\). However, this approach does not guarantee that \(a\) will have at least 4 divisors and the difference between any two divisors will be at least \(d\).

Consider the following counterexample:
- For \(d = 1\), the smallest integer \(a\) with at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least 1 is 6. The divisors of 6 are [1, 2, 3, 6].
- However, the provided code will find the first two primes that differ by at least 1, which are 2 and 3, and compute \(a = 2 \times 3 = 6\). This works for \(d = 1\).

But for larger \(d\), the code might fail:
- For \(d = 2\), the smallest integer \(a\) is 15 (divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]), but the code might find 3 and 5, and compute \(a = 3 \times 5 = 15\).

The critical issue is that the code does not consider all possible factorizations that meet the criteria. Instead, it relies on finding pairs of primes, which is insufficient for all cases.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
