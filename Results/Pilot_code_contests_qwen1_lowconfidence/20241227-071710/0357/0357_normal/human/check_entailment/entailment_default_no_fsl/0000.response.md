Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_9` does not guarantee that the chosen prime numbers will satisfy the condition that the difference between any two divisors of the product is at least `d`.

The function `func_9` selects the first and next prime numbers in the list of primes such that the difference between them is at least `d`. However, this approach does not ensure that the product of these two primes will have at least four divisors with the required differences. 

To illustrate, consider the following case:

- Input: `d = 2`
- Primes: `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...]`

According to the function:
- `i = 0` (index of 2)
- `j = 1` (index of 3)
- The product is `2 * 3 = 6`, which has divisors `[1, 2, 3, 6]`.
- The difference between the smallest pair of divisors (1 and 2) is 1, which is less than `d = 2`.

This case shows that the code does not guarantee the required conditions, making the program incorrect. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
