Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not appear to handle the problem correctly. Specifically, it seems to rely on an external list `primes` which is not defined within the given code snippet. Without this list, the function `func_9` will fail to execute properly.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider the logic required to solve the problem:

1. We need to find the smallest integer `a` with at least 4 divisors.
2. The difference between any two divisors of `a` must be at least `d`.

Given the constraints, a more straightforward approach would involve generating integers and checking their divisors. However, the provided code does not seem to implement this logic. Instead, it attempts to use a precomputed list of prime numbers, which is not defined in the given functions.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate why the current implementation is incorrect:

- Input: `d = 2`
- Expected output: `15` (as per the example in the problem statement)

However, the current implementation will not produce the correct result because it relies on an undefined `primes` list and does not correctly generate the smallest integer `a` with the required properties.

Therefore, since the program cannot be executed as-is due to the missing `primes` list and does not seem to implement the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly, the correctness is `False`.
