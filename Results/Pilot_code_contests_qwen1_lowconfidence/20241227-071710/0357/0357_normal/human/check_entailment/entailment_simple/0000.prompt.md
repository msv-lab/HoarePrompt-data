You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time
    start_time = int(round(time() * 1000))
    input = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').readline
    readAll = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').read
    sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[2], 'w')
else:
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    readAll = sys.stdin.read

However, based on the context and typical usage, we can infer that `func_2` is expected to read input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer d. The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of d for each test case.
def func_2():

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
