Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly compute the smallest positive integer `a` that satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem description.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Problem Logic**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to find the smallest positive integer `a` that has at least 4 divisors and where the difference between any two divisors is at least `d`. Instead, the program appears to focus on finding prime numbers and using them to construct the required integer `a`.

2. **Lack of Core Functionality**:
   - The core functionality of finding the smallest integer `a` with the specified properties is not present in the provided code. The program seems to be more focused on prime numbers and their differences, rather than constructing the required integer `a`.

3. **Misalignment with Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires finding an integer `a` that meets specific criteria, but the implementation does not address these criteria. For instance, the program does not ensure that `a` has at least 4 divisors or that the difference between any two divisors of `a` is at least `d`.

#### Example Analysis:

- **Example Input**: 
  ```
  2
  1
  2
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  6
  15
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  The provided code does not generate the correct output for these inputs. It appears to be focusing on finding prime numbers and their differences, which does not align with the requirement to find the smallest integer `a` with the specified properties.

### Conclusion:

The program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
