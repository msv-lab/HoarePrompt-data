You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_1` are defined or used, indicating that the function does not take any input parameters or return any values related to the problem description.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program will have received an integer value from the user as input. This integer value can be any valid integer that the user enters. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, which would result in an error since the `int()` function will raise a `ValueError`. In such cases, the function may need to handle exceptions to ensure robust behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables' descriptions or relationships are provided within the given function signature. However, based on the context and typical usage, we can infer that `func_2` is expected to read input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer d. The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of d for each test case.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers. It then converts this sequence into a list of integers and returns it. This process handles multiple test cases, where each test case is a single line of input containing one or more integers separated by spaces. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that the input is well-formed and each line contains at least one integer. If the input is empty or improperly formatted (e.g., contains non-integer values), the function will still attempt to convert the input, potentially leading to ValueError exceptions, which are not caught within the provided code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing an integer followed by a non-space character, such that s ends with a character other than a digit.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #`s[:-1]` which is a list of characters representing an integer followed by a non-space character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no parameters and prompts the user to input a string `s` that ends with a non-digit character. It then returns a list of characters representing the integer part of `s`, excluding the last character. The function ensures that the returned list contains only the digits that form the integer part of the input string, effectively removing the trailing non-digit character.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing an integer followed by a non-empty substring that is not part of the integer representation.
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns a substring of 's' that excludes the last character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a single string parameter `s`, which is expected to end with a non-digit character following a sequence of digits. The function returns a substring of `s` that excludes the last character. If `s` consists solely of digits or is empty, the function will still remove the last character (if present), potentially returning an empty string. If `s` ends with a digit and no non-digit character follows, the function will only return the digits without the trailing digit.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing test cases, where each element in the list is a single integer d such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10000.
def func_5(l, sep):
    print(sep.join(map(str, l)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing test cases and a separator `sep`. It then joins the elements of the list `l` into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by the value of `sep`. If `sep` is not specified or is of a type other than a string, the function will still attempt to join the list using `sep`, resulting in potentially undefined behavior. After processing, the function prints the joined string and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the joined string is printed to the console.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_6(n):
    i = 1
    sq_n = n ** 0.5
    divs = []
    while i <= sq_n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if n / i != i:
                divs.append(n / i)
        
        i = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than `sq_n`, `divs` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (both the divisor and its corresponding quotient when `n` is divided by the divisor), and `sq_n` is the square root of the original value of `n`.
    return sorted(divs)
    #The program returns a list of divisors of `n`, sorted in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a positive integer `n` as a parameter. It calculates all divisors of `n`, including both the divisors and their corresponding quotients when `n` is divided by them. The function then stores these divisors in a list, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the only divisor is 1 itself) or when `n` is a prime number (the only divisors are 1 and `n`). The function handles these cases correctly by ensuring that each unique divisor is added to the list exactly once and sorting the final list.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10000.
def func_7(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer such that 1 < n <= 10000
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 10000 and n > 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 10000 and n > 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and n is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10000\), \(n > 3\), \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\); `i` is increased to a value such that \((i + 6)^2 > n\)
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 10000. It checks whether `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3. Specifically, the function follows these steps:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is even or divisible by 3, it returns `False`.
4. For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks divisibility starting from 5 up to the square root of `n`, incrementing by 6 each time (checking `i` and `i + 2`).
5. If no divisors are found during the check, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `n` is 1 or 2, the function correctly returns `False` and `True` respectively, which is consistent with the annotations.
- When `n` is 3, the function also correctly returns `True`.
- For even numbers and multiples of 3, the function correctly returns `False`.
- For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, the function correctly returns `True` if no divisors are found up to the square root of `n`.

The function does not explicitly handle the case when `n` is a perfect square. While the loop condition `i * i <= n` ensures that the loop terminates before checking numbers greater than the square root of `n`, it does not guarantee that the loop covers all numbers up to the square root of `n` if `n` is a perfect square. However, since the function correctly handles non-perfect squares, and the condition `i * i <= n` is sufficient for the given range, this can be considered an implicit edge case rather than a missing functionality.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, x is an integer, low and high are integers representing the current search range within the list arr.
def func_8(arr, x, low, high):
    if (high >= low) :
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if (arr[mid] == x) :
            return mid, mid
            #`The program returns mid which is equal to (high + low) // 2, and mid again`
        else :
            if (arr[mid] > x) :
                return func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)
                #The program returns the result of calling `func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)` where `arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `x` is an integer, `low` is an integer, and `mid` is set to `(high + low) // 2` with `arr[mid]` being greater than `x`, and `mid - 1` as the new high value
            else :
                return func_8(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
                #The program returns the result of calling function `func_8` with arguments `arr`, `x`, `mid + 1`, and `high`, where `mid` is equal to `(high + low) // 2` and `arr[mid] <= x`
    else :
        return high, low
        #The program returns high and low, where high and low are integers representing the current search range within the list arr, and the condition (high < low) is true
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in ascending order, an integer `x` to search for, and two integers `low` and `high` representing the current search range within the list. It performs a binary search to find the index of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns the index `mid` twice. If `x` is not found, it continues the search in the appropriate half of the list by adjusting the `low` and `high` values. If the search range becomes invalid (i.e., `high < low`), it returns the values of `high` and `low`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality included:
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is found, returning `mid` twice.
- The function correctly adjusts the search range based on whether `x` is less than or greater than `arr[mid]`.
- The function correctly returns `high` and `low` when the search range is invalid (i.e., `high < low`).
- However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `x` is not found within the search range, although this is implied by the return of `high` and `low` when the range is invalid.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primes is a list of prime numbers, and d is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10000.
def func_9():
    d = func_1()
    i = func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)[1]
    j = i + 1
    while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
        j += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i` + the number of times the loop executed, and `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`
    print(primes[i] * primes[j])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` takes no explicit parameters and returns nothing. It first calls `func_1()` to get an integer `d`. Then, it uses `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` to find a pair of indices `i` and `j` in the list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between the `j`-th and `i`-th prime numbers is at least `d`. After the loop, it prints the product of these two prime numbers. If no such pair is found, the loop will continue until the end of the list, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
