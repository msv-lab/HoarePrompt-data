Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not align with the problem description. The function `func_9` attempts to find a pair of prime numbers whose difference is at least `d` and then prints their product. However, this approach does not ensure that the resulting product has at least 4 divisors, nor does it guarantee that the difference condition is met between any two divisors of the product. The problem requires finding the smallest positive integer `a` that meets both criteria, and the current implementation does not address this requirement. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is valid.
