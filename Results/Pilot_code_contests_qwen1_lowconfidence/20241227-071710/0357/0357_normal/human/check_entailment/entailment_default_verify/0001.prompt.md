You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not appear to handle the problem correctly. Specifically, it seems to rely on an external list `primes` which is not defined within the given code snippet. Without this list, the function `func_9` will fail to execute properly.

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider the logic required to solve the problem:

1. We need to find the smallest integer `a` with at least 4 divisors.
2. The difference between any two divisors of `a` must be at least `d`.

Given the constraints, a more straightforward approach would involve generating integers and checking their divisors. However, the provided code does not seem to implement this logic. Instead, it attempts to use a precomputed list of prime numbers, which is not defined in the given functions.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate why the current implementation is incorrect:

- Input: `d = 2`
- Expected output: `15` (as per the example in the problem statement)

However, the current implementation will not produce the correct result because it relies on an undefined `primes` list and does not correctly generate the smallest integer `a` with the required properties.

Therefore, since the program cannot be executed as-is due to the missing `primes` list and does not seem to implement the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly, the correctness is `False`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 9 : The function `func_9` takes no explicit parameters and returns nothing. It first calls `func_1()` to get an integer `d`. Then, it uses `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` to find a pair of indices `i` and `j` in the list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between the `j`-th and `i`-th prime numbers is at least `d`. After the loop, it prints the product of these two prime numbers. If no such pair is found, the loop will continue until the end of the list, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
