You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.

We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that 

  * a has at least 4 divisors; 
  * difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10000).

Output

For each test case print one integer a — the answer for this test case.

Example

Input


2
1
2


Output


6
15

Note

In the first test case, integer 6 have following divisors: [1, 2, 3, 6]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 1. There is no smaller integer with at least 4 divisors.

In the second test case, integer 15 have following divisors: [1, 3, 5, 15]. There are 4 of them and the difference between any two of them is at least 2.

The answer 12 is INVALID because divisors are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. And the difference between, for example, divisors 2 and 3 is less than d=2.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not actually solve the given problem. It seems to be attempting to solve a different problem involving prime numbers and arrays, which is not aligned with the problem description. Specifically, the program includes functions for finding divisors, checking primality, and performing binary search, but these do not address the task of finding the smallest positive integer \(a\) with at least 4 divisors such that the difference between any two divisors is at least \(d\).

The main issue lies in `func_9()`, which is supposed to handle the problem, but it does not appear to be implemented correctly. It attempts to use a list of primes (`primes`) which is not defined anywhere in the code, and it does not implement the logic required to find the desired integer \(a\).

Here is an outline of how the solution should work:
1. Start with the smallest possible number and check its divisors.
2. Ensure the number has at least 4 divisors.
3. Check that the difference between any two divisors is at least \(d\).
4. Continue checking subsequent numbers until the conditions are met.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

testing = len(sys.argv) == 4 and sys.argv[3] == 'myTest'
if testing:
    cmd = sys.stdout
    from time import time
    start_time = int(round(time() * 1000))
    input = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').readline
    readAll = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').read
    sys.stdout = open(sys.argv[2], 'w')
else:
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    readAll = sys.stdin.read
p = [False] * 21001
for i in xrange(1, 21001):
    p[i] = func_7(i)
primes = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(p) if x]
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in xrange(func_1()):
        func_9()
    if testing:
        sys.stdout = cmd
        print(int(round(time() * 1000)) - start_time)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_1` are defined or used, indicating that the function does not take any input parameters or return any values related to the problem description.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program will have received an integer value from the user as input. This integer value can be any valid integer that the user enters. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, which would result in an error since the `int()` function will raise a `ValueError`. In such cases, the function may need to handle exceptions to ensure robust behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables' descriptions or relationships are provided within the given function signature. However, based on the context and typical usage, we can infer that `func_2` is expected to read input for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer d. The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of d for each test case.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers. It then converts this sequence into a list of integers and returns it. This process handles multiple test cases, where each test case is a single line of input containing one or more integers separated by spaces. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function assumes that the input is well-formed and each line contains at least one integer. If the input is empty or improperly formatted (e.g., contains non-integer values), the function will still attempt to convert the input, potentially leading to ValueError exceptions, which are not caught within the provided code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing an integer followed by a non-space character, such that s ends with a character other than a digit.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
    #`s[:-1]` which is a list of characters representing an integer followed by a non-space character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no parameters and prompts the user to input a string `s` that ends with a non-digit character. It then returns a list of characters representing the integer part of `s`, excluding the last character. The function ensures that the returned list contains only the digits that form the integer part of the input string, effectively removing the trailing non-digit character.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing an integer followed by a non-empty substring that is not part of the integer representation.
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
    #The program returns a substring of 's' that excludes the last character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a single string parameter `s`, which is expected to end with a non-digit character following a sequence of digits. The function returns a substring of `s` that excludes the last character. If `s` consists solely of digits or is empty, the function will still remove the last character (if present), potentially returning an empty string. If `s` ends with a digit and no non-digit character follows, the function will only return the digits without the trailing digit.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing test cases, where each element in the list is a single integer d such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 10000.
def func_5(l, sep):
    print(sep.join(map(str, l)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing test cases and a separator `sep`. It then joins the elements of the list `l` into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by the value of `sep`. If `sep` is not specified or is of a type other than a string, the function will still attempt to join the list using `sep`, resulting in potentially undefined behavior. After processing, the function prints the joined string and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the joined string is printed to the console.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_6(n):
    i = 1
    sq_n = n ** 0.5
    divs = []
    while i <= sq_n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if n / i != i:
                divs.append(n / i)
        
        i = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than `sq_n`, `divs` is a list containing all divisors of `n` (both the divisor and its corresponding quotient when `n` is divided by the divisor), and `sq_n` is the square root of the original value of `n`.
    return sorted(divs)
    #The program returns a list of divisors of `n`, sorted in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a positive integer `n` as a parameter. It calculates all divisors of `n`, including both the divisors and their corresponding quotients when `n` is divided by them. The function then stores these divisors in a list, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the only divisor is 1 itself) or when `n` is a prime number (the only divisors are 1 and `n`). The function handles these cases correctly by ensuring that each unique divisor is added to the list exactly once and sorting the final list.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10000.
def func_7(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer such that 1 < n <= 10000
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 10000 and n > 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 10000 and n > 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and n is not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i += 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 10000\), \(n > 3\), \(n\) is not divisible by 2 and 3, and for all integers \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{n}\), \(n\) is not divisible by \(i\) or \(i + 2\); `i` is increased to a value such that \((i + 6)^2 > n\)
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 10000. It checks whether `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3. Specifically, the function follows these steps:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is even or divisible by 3, it returns `False`.
4. For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, it checks divisibility starting from 5 up to the square root of `n`, incrementing by 6 each time (checking `i` and `i + 2`).
5. If no divisors are found during the check, it returns `True`.

Potential edge cases include:
- When `n` is 1 or 2, the function correctly returns `False` and `True` respectively, which is consistent with the annotations.
- When `n` is 3, the function also correctly returns `True`.
- For even numbers and multiples of 3, the function correctly returns `False`.
- For numbers greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, the function correctly returns `True` if no divisors are found up to the square root of `n`.

The function does not explicitly handle the case when `n` is a perfect square. While the loop condition `i * i <= n` ensures that the loop terminates before checking numbers greater than the square root of `n`, it does not guarantee that the loop covers all numbers up to the square root of `n` if `n` is a perfect square. However, since the function correctly handles non-perfect squares, and the condition `i * i <= n` is sufficient for the given range, this can be considered an implicit edge case rather than a missing functionality.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, x is an integer, low and high are integers representing the current search range within the list arr.
def func_8(arr, x, low, high):
    if (high >= low) :
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if (arr[mid] == x) :
            return mid, mid
            #`The program returns mid which is equal to (high + low) // 2, and mid again`
        else :
            if (arr[mid] > x) :
                return func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)
                #The program returns the result of calling `func_8(arr, x, low, mid - 1)` where `arr` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `x` is an integer, `low` is an integer, and `mid` is set to `(high + low) // 2` with `arr[mid]` being greater than `x`, and `mid - 1` as the new high value
            else :
                return func_8(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
                #The program returns the result of calling function `func_8` with arguments `arr`, `x`, `mid + 1`, and `high`, where `mid` is equal to `(high + low) // 2` and `arr[mid] <= x`
    else :
        return high, low
        #The program returns high and low, where high and low are integers representing the current search range within the list arr, and the condition (high < low) is true
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in ascending order, an integer `x` to search for, and two integers `low` and `high` representing the current search range within the list. It performs a binary search to find the index of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns the index `mid` twice. If `x` is not found, it continues the search in the appropriate half of the list by adjusting the `low` and `high` values. If the search range becomes invalid (i.e., `high < low`), it returns the values of `high` and `low`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality included:
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is found, returning `mid` twice.
- The function correctly adjusts the search range based on whether `x` is less than or greater than `arr[mid]`.
- The function correctly returns `high` and `low` when the search range is invalid (i.e., `high < low`).
- However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `x` is not found within the search range, although this is implied by the return of `high` and `low` when the range is invalid.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primes is a list of prime numbers, and d is an integer such that 1 <= d <= 10000.
def func_9():
    d = func_1()
    i = func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)[1]
    j = i + 1
    while primes[j] - primes[i] < d:
        j += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the second element of the tuple returned by `func_8(primes, d, 0, len(primes) - 1)`, `j` is `i` + the number of times the loop executed, and `primes[j] - primes[i] >= d`
    print(primes[i] * primes[j])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` takes no explicit parameters and returns nothing. It first calls `func_1()` to get an integer `d`. Then, it uses `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` to find a pair of indices `i` and `j` in the list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between the `j`-th and `i`-th prime numbers is at least `d`. After the loop, it prints the product of these two prime numbers. If no such pair is found, the loop will continue until the end of the list, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.
