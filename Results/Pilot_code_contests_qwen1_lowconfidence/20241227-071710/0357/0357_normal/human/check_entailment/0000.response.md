Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not actually solve the given problem. It seems to be attempting to solve a different problem involving prime numbers and arrays, which is not aligned with the problem description. Specifically, the program includes functions for finding divisors, checking primality, and performing binary search, but these do not address the task of finding the smallest positive integer \(a\) with at least 4 divisors such that the difference between any two divisors is at least \(d\).

The main issue lies in `func_9()`, which is supposed to handle the problem, but it does not appear to be implemented correctly. It attempts to use a list of primes (`primes`) which is not defined anywhere in the code, and it does not implement the logic required to find the desired integer \(a\).

Here is an outline of how the solution should work:
1. Start with the smallest possible number and check its divisors.
2. Ensure the number has at least 4 divisors.
3. Check that the difference between any two divisors is at least \(d\).
4. Continue checking subsequent numbers until the conditions are met.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.
