The function `func_6` accepts a positive integer `n` as a parameter. It calculates all divisors of `n`, including both the divisors and their corresponding quotients when `n` is divided by them. The function then stores these divisors in a list, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (the only divisor is 1 itself) or when `n` is a prime number (the only divisors are 1 and `n`). The function handles these cases correctly by ensuring that each unique divisor is added to the list exactly once and sorting the final list.
