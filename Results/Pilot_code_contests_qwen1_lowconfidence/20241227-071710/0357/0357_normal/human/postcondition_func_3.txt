The function `func_4` accepts a single string parameter `s`, which is expected to end with a non-digit character following a sequence of digits. The function returns a substring of `s` that excludes the last character. If `s` consists solely of digits or is empty, the function will still remove the last character (if present), potentially returning an empty string. If `s` ends with a digit and no non-digit character follows, the function will only return the digits without the trailing digit.
