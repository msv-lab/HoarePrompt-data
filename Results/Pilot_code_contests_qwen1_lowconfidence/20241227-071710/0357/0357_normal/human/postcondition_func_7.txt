The function `func_8` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in ascending order, an integer `x` to search for, and two integers `low` and `high` representing the current search range within the list. It performs a binary search to find the index of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns the index `mid` twice. If `x` is not found, it continues the search in the appropriate half of the list by adjusting the `low` and `high` values. If the search range becomes invalid (i.e., `high < low`), it returns the values of `high` and `low`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality included:
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is found, returning `mid` twice.
- The function correctly adjusts the search range based on whether `x` is less than or greater than `arr[mid]`.
- The function correctly returns `high` and `low` when the search range is invalid (i.e., `high < low`).
- However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `x` is not found within the search range, although this is implied by the return of `high` and `low` when the range is invalid.
