The function `func_9` takes no explicit parameters and returns nothing. It first calls `func_1()` to get an integer `d`. Then, it uses `func_8(primes, d + 1, 0, len(primes) - 1)` to find a pair of indices `i` and `j` in the list of prime numbers `primes` such that the difference between the `j`-th and `i`-th prime numbers is at least `d`. After the loop, it prints the product of these two prime numbers. If no such pair is found, the loop will continue until the end of the list, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.
