Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully handle the case where the tree has an even diameter. According to the problem description, if there are multiple central nodes due to an even diameter, the program should still find and print any one of them. However, the current implementation does not ensure this. Specifically:

1. The code identifies the farthest node from the initial root (node 1) and then checks its neighbors to find a potential central node.
2. If the farthest node has a degree of 1, it sets `top` to this node. Otherwise, it prints `-1`, which is incorrect because there could be multiple central nodes.

To fix this, the code needs to handle the scenario where the farthest node has a degree greater than 1. In such cases, the code should perform another BFS to find the neighbors of the farthest node and check their degrees to identify the central nodes.

Here is an example where the code fails:

### Example Input:
```
6
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
4 6
```

### Expected Output:
```
4
```

### Actual Output:
```
-1
```

In this example, node 4 is the central node because:
- The distance from node 4 to any other node is 1.
- All nodes connected to node 4 have the same degree (2).

However, the current code does not handle this case correctly and prints `-1`. Therefore, the code is not fully correct for every potential case.
