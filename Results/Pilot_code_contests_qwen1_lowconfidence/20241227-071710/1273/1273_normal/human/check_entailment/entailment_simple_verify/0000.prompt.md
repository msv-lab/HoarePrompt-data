You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have given tree consist of n vertices. Select a vertex as root vertex that satisfies the condition below.

  * For all vertices v_{1} and v_{2}, if distance(root, v_{1}) = distance(root, v_{2}) then degree(v_{1}) = degree(v_{2}), where degree means the number of vertices connected to that vertex, and distance means the number of edges between two vertices. 



Determine and find if there is such root vertex in the tree. If there are multiple answers, find any of them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of vertices.

Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers v_{i} and u_{i} (1 ≤ v_{i} < u_{i} ≤ n) — it means there is an edge exist between v_{i} and u_{i}. It is guaranteed that the graph forms tree.

Output

If there is such root vertex exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print -1.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a root vertex in a tree that satisfies the given condition. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not guarantee finding the correct root vertex for all possible inputs. Specifically, the program's approach to checking the degree and distance conditions is not fully robust.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
6
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```

In this case, the program should output `3` because it is a valid root vertex that satisfies the condition. However, the current implementation might not correctly identify `3` as the root vertex due to its complex and potentially incorrect handling of distances and degrees.

Moreover, the program's structure and logic are overly complicated and do not clearly ensure that all potential cases are handled correctly. A more straightforward and accurate approach would involve directly verifying the condition for each vertex without the extensive nested checks and updates.

To verify the correctness, one could test with various tree structures and ensure that the program identifies the correct root vertex for all valid cases and outputs `-1` for invalid cases. Given the complexity and potential flaws, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the answer is `False`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
