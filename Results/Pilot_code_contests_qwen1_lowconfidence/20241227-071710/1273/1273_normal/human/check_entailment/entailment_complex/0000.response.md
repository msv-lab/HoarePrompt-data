Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if there exists a root vertex in a tree that satisfies the given conditions. Let's break down how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Reading and Tree Construction**:
   - The program reads the number of vertices \( n \) and the edges of the tree.
   - It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, which is essential for further processing.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Distance Calculation**:
   - The program performs two BFS traversals from node 1 to compute the shortest distance from node 1 to all other nodes.
   - This step ensures that all nodes are reachable and calculates the distance from node 1 to each node.

3. **Checking Reachability**:
   - The program checks if all nodes are reachable from node 1. If not, it prints `-1` and exits, which correctly handles the case where the tree is not fully connected.

4. **Finding the Farthest Node**:
   - The program identifies the farthest node from node 1. This node is a candidate for the root vertex because it maximizes the symmetry required by the problem.

5. **Second BFS from the Farthest Node**:
   - Another BFS is performed from the farthest node to explore the tree further and ensure the properties hold for all nodes at the same distance from the farthest node.

6. **Degree Check**:
   - The program checks if the degree of nodes at the same distance from the farthest node is consistent. If consistent, it prints the farthest node as the root vertex. If not, it continues to explore further nodes.

7. **Handling Central Nodes**:
   - The program attempts to identify the central node(s) by checking the degrees of nodes at the same distance from the farthest node. It handles both single and double central nodes cases.

### Edge Cases Considered:

- **Fully Connected Trees**: The program correctly identifies a root vertex when all nodes are at the same distance from the farthest node.
- **Trees with Even Diameter**: The program handles the case where the tree has two central nodes by continuing to check the degrees of nodes at the same distance from the farthest node.
- **Disconnected Trees**: The program correctly identifies that the tree is not fully connected and prints `-1`.

### Summary:

The program correctly implements the logic to find a root vertex in a tree that satisfies the given conditions. It handles all the cases described in the problem statement and does not miss any edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
