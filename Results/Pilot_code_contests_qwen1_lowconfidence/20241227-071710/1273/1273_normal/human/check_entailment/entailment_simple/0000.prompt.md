You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have given tree consist of n vertices. Select a vertex as root vertex that satisfies the condition below.

  * For all vertices v_{1} and v_{2}, if distance(root, v_{1}) = distance(root, v_{2}) then degree(v_{1}) = degree(v_{2}), where degree means the number of vertices connected to that vertex, and distance means the number of edges between two vertices. 



Determine and find if there is such root vertex in the tree. If there are multiple answers, find any of them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of vertices.

Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers v_{i} and u_{i} (1 ≤ v_{i} < u_{i} ≤ n) — it means there is an edge exist between v_{i} and u_{i}. It is guaranteed that the graph forms tree.

Output

If there is such root vertex exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print -1.

Examples

Note

This is the picture for the first example. 1, 5, 7 also can be a valid answer.

This is the picture for the second example. You can see that it's impossible to find such root vertex.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
