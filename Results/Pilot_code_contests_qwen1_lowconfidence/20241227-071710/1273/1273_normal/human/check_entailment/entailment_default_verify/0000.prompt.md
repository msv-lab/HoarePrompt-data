You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have given tree consist of n vertices. Select a vertex as root vertex that satisfies the condition below.

  * For all vertices v_{1} and v_{2}, if distance(root, v_{1}) = distance(root, v_{2}) then degree(v_{1}) = degree(v_{2}), where degree means the number of vertices connected to that vertex, and distance means the number of edges between two vertices. 



Determine and find if there is such root vertex in the tree. If there are multiple answers, find any of them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the number of vertices.

Each of the next n-1 lines contains two integers v_{i} and u_{i} (1 ≤ v_{i} < u_{i} ≤ n) — it means there is an edge exist between v_{i} and u_{i}. It is guaranteed that the graph forms tree.

Output

If there is such root vertex exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print -1.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a root vertex in a tree that satisfies the given condition. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not guarantee finding the correct root vertex for all possible inputs. Specifically, the program's approach to checking the degree and distance conditions is not fully robust.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
6
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```

In this case, the program should output `3` because it is a valid root vertex that satisfies the condition. However, the current implementation might not correctly identify `3` as the root vertex due to its complex and potentially incorrect handling of distances and degrees.

Moreover, the program's structure and logic are overly complicated and do not clearly ensure that all potential cases are handled correctly. A more straightforward and accurate approach would involve directly verifying the condition for each vertex without the extensive nested checks and updates.

To verify the correctness, one could test with various tree structures and ensure that the program identifies the correct root vertex for all valid cases and outputs `-1` for invalid cases. Given the complexity and potential flaws, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the answer is `False`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` accepts a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree and determines if the input forms a valid tree structure. Specifically, it checks if the tree is well-formed and if there is a unique central node (or two in case of a tree with even diameter). If the tree is valid, it prints the central node; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

1. The function reads the number of vertices \(n\) and the edges of the tree.
2. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
3. It computes the shortest distance from a root node (node 1) to all other nodes using a breadth-first search (BFS).
4. It checks if all nodes are reachable from the root node.
5. If not all nodes are reachable, it prints `-1`.
6. It identifies the farthest node from the root node and performs another BFS from this node to find the central node.
7. It ensures the central node has a degree of 2 (for single central node) or 1 (for two central nodes in case of even diameter).
8. If the tree passes all checks, it prints the central node; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes the input always forms a valid tree structure (i.e., no cycles and exactly \(n-1\) edges).
- There is no explicit check for the tree being acyclic, though the BFS traversal implicitly verifies this.
- The function does not handle the case where the tree has multiple central nodes due to an even diameter explicitly, although the code attempts to identify the farthest node and then checks its neighbors.
- The function does not validate the input types or ranges explicitly, assuming the input is correctly formatted.

In summary, the function aims to validate a tree structure and find its central node but may not cover all edge cases fully, particularly those involving trees with even diameters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
