`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. The previous state of `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is updated to reflect this new value.

Output State: **`cur` is the next node in `e[cur]`, `q` is the original `q` without its first element plus `to`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
