`bad` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `i`, `n`, `deg[dep[i]]`, and `e[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to -1, and `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`; `bad` is `True`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to -1, and `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`; `bad` is `True`**
