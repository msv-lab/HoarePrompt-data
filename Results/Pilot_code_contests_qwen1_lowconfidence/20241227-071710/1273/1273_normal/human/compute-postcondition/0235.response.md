Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `deg[dep[2]]` equals `len(e[2])`, no change is made to `bad` and the most internal loop or if statement continues. If `deg[dep[2]]` does not equal `len(e[2])`, then `bad` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
