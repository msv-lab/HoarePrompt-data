The code assigns the value of `end` to `pred[to]`. Before the assignment, `end` is 1 and `to` is not specified in the initial state, but since `pred[to]` is being updated, we know that `to` must be an index in the `pred` list.

Given that `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are initially 0, and `pred[to]` is updated to `end`, the value of `pred[to]` becomes 1. All other elements in the `pred` list remain unchanged, as only `pred[to]` is modified.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `q` remains a deque([]),
- `cur` remains 1,
- `end` remains 1,
- `dep` remains a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0,
- `pred` remains a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[to]` which is now 1,
- `e[1]` contains at least one element and the current value of `dep[to]` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is deque([]), `cur` is 1, `end` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[to]` which is 1, `e[1]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is 0.**
