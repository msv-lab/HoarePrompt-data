The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Based on the initial state:

- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `bad` is `False`.
- `top` is `center`.
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `cur` is `center`.
- `to` is an index such that `dep[to] == -1`.
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
- `len(e[to])` is `2`.

Since `dep[cur]` is `0`, the new value of `dep[to]` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` is `1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `top` is `center`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `center`, `to` is an index such that `dep[to] == -1`, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `len(e[to])` is `2`.**
