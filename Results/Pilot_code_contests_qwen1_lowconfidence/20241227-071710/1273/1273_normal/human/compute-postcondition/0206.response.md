The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are known:
- `dep[cur]` is the current depth of the node `cur` in the shortest path tree.
- `to` is an adjacent node of `cur`.

After executing `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`, the depth of `to` is updated to be one more than the depth of `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is the queue with its leftmost element removed, `end` is the last visited node, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1**, and `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree.
