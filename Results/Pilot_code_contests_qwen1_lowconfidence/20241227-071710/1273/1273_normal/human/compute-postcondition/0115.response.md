The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the value of `dep[end]`. Given the initial conditions, `dep[end]` is known to be the shortest distance from node 1 to the node currently in `end`, and `dep[to]` is initially -1. After executing the code, `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[end] + 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being a node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i` and now `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, and `e[end]` is not an empty list.**
