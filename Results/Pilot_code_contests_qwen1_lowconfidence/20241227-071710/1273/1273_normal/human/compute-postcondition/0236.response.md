According to the given code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. The loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
3. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, it remains unchanged for the next iteration as there's no information suggesting it changes within the loop.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3, and `n` will still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
