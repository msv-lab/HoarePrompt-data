The code snippet `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` assigns the value of `len(e[i])` to `deg[dep[i]]`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `dep` and `e`, so we cannot determine the exact value that will be assigned. But we know that `i` is 3 and `n` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `deg[dep[3]]` is assigned the value of `len(e[3])`, `bad` remains unchanged.**
