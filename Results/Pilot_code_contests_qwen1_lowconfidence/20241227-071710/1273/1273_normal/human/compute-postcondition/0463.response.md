The function `func` accepts a parameter which is a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree. Each tuple contains two integers \(v_i\) and \(u_i\) indicating an edge between \(v_i\) and \(u_i\). The number of vertices \(n\) is given as the first integer in the input, and it satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). 

Case_1: The function returns whether the input represents a valid tree structure.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree and determine if the input forms a valid tree structure.
