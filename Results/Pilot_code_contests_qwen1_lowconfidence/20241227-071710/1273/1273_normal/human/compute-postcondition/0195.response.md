The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The previous value of `q` is not specified, but it is implied that `q` is a list. The value of `to` is determined by `dep[to]` being `dep[cur] + 1`, which means `to` is a neighbor of `cur` and has a depth one more than `cur`. The states of the other variables (`cur` and `dep`) are not affected.

Output State: **`cur` is a valid node that exists in the graph and has at least one neighbor; `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`; `q` is a list containing elements with the last element being `to`.**
