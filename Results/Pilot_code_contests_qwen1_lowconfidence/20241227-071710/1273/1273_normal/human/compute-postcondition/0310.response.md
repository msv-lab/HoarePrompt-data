`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. Given that `dep[cur]` is `1`, `dep[to]` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, `to` is the next node in `e[cur]` with `dep[to]` being `2`, `q` includes the value of `to` if `len(e[to]) == 2`, and `top` is the current value of `to` if `len(e[to]) != 1`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, `to` is the next node in `e[cur]` with `dep[to]` being `2`, `q` includes the value of `to` if `len(e[to]) == 2`, and `top` is the current value of `to` if `len(e[to]) != 1**.
