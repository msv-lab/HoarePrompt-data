Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `True` if at any point `deg[dep[i]]` was found to be different from `len(e[i])`, otherwise `bad` is `False`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `0`, `end` is the last visited node, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, and `bad` is a boolean indicating whether there was a contradiction in the shortest path distances.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all nodes from 1 to \( n \). After all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- If at any point during the loop, `deg[dep[i]]` is found to be different from `len(e[i])`, the condition inside the `elif` block triggers, setting `bad` to `True` and breaking out of the loop.
- If no such contradiction is found throughout the loop, `bad` remains `False`.
- The other variables (`q`, `cur`, `end`, `dep`, `pred`, `deg`) maintain their roles and properties as described in the initial state, with `deg` being updated based on the shortest path distances determined.
