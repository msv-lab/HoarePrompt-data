Postcondition: ***`cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is the queue with `to` appended to it, `end` is the last visited node, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1 if `dep[to] == -1`***

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part. The condition `dep[to] == -1` ensures that `to` is a new node discovered during the breadth-first search, and thus it is appended to the queue `q`. All other variables remain in the same state as described in the if part's postcondition.
