Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is the current value of `to`, `q` is an empty list, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, and `to` is the next node in `e[cur]`. If `len(e[to])` equals 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
