Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[top]` which is `1`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `q` is an empty list, `cur` is `center`, and `top` is `to`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
