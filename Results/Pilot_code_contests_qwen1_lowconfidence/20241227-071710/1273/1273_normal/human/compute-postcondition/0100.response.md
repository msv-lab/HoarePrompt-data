Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed, and this element is either `to` or remains as the leftmost element of `q` before the removal.
   - `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`.
   - If `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[end] + 1` and `pred[to]` is set to `end`. Otherwise, `dep` and `pred` remain unchanged.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `e[end]`, where `e` is an adjacency list representing the graph.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `to` is processed, and we need to determine the new state for the next iteration.
   - `q` is a deque, and it may or may not have been modified during the previous iteration based on whether `dep[to]` was updated.
   - `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal.
   - `cur` remains 0.
   - `dep` and `pred` may have been updated if `dep[to]` was set to `dep[end] + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next `to` value needs to be determined.
   - `end` remains the same as the current leftmost element of `q` before the removal.
   - `cur` remains 0.
   - `dep` and `pred` will be checked against the next `to` value to see if they need to be updated.

Given the information, the key elements to adjust for the next iteration are:

- `q`: It could be empty or contain elements depending on the updates made.
- `end`: The leftmost element of `q` before the removal.
- `cur`: Remains 0.
- `dep` and `pred`: These lists remain as they are unless they were updated in the previous iteration.

Since the exact state of `q` isn't specified, we'll assume it retains the same form (a deque with the leftmost element potentially updated or removed).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated or removed, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, `cur` is 0, `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update (or updated if `dep[to]` was set to `dep[end] + 1`).**

To be more precise, the exact state would depend on the specific elements in `q` and the values in `dep` and `pred`. However, without the exact values, we generalize as follows:

State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated or removed, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, `cur` is 0, `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update (or updated if `dep[to]` was set to `dep[end] + 1`).**
