The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This changes the state of `q` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`, `to` is defined, `q` is now `[to]` (assuming `q` was initially empty), `dep[center]` is 0, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is 0 if `dep[cur]` was -1, and `dep[to]` is 1 if `dep[cur]` was 0.**
