`q` is a queue, and `to` is appended to it. The value of `q` changes, and `to` is added as the last element. The values of `i`, `cur`, and `dep[to]` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to the next element in `q`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `q` now includes the previous elements plus `to`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to the next element in `q`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `q` now includes the previous elements plus `to`.**
