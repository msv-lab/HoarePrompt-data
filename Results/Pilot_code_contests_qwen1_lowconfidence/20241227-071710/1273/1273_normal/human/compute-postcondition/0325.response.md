The code snippet appends the variable `to` to the list `q`. Let's analyze the impact on each variable:

- `total` remains unchanged as it was initially 0.
- `i` remains unchanged as it was initially `n + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it was initially a positive integer.
- `bad` remains unchanged as it was initially `False`.
- `cur` remains unchanged as it was the leftmost element of `q` before its removal.
- `to` remains unchanged as it was initially defined.
- `q` is modified by appending `to` to it, so the new state of `q` is the original elements plus `to`.
- `dep[center]` remains unchanged as it was initially 0.
- `e[cur]` remains unchanged as it was initially defined and must contain at least one element.
- `dep[to]` remains unchanged as it was initially 1.
- `e[to]` remains unchanged as its length was initially 2.

Therefore, the updated state after the code is executed is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (and `q` has the leftmost element removed), `to` is defined, `q` has `to` appended, `dep[center]` is 0, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is 1, and the length of `e[to]` is 2.**
