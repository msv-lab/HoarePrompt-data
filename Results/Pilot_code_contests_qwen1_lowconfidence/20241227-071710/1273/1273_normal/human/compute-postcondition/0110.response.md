Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, and `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree. All nodes reachable from node 1 have their distances updated and predecessors set correctly.**

### Explanation:
- **`q`**: The deque `q` contains the nodes to be explored, with the leftmost element being the node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1.
- **`end`**: This is the leftmost element of `q` before any removal occurs. It is used to start the exploration process.
- **`cur`**: This variable remains 0 throughout the loop since no operations are performed on it inside the loop.
- **`dep`**: After all iterations, `dep[i]` will contain the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i` for all nodes `i` that are reachable from node 1. Nodes that are not reachable will retain their initial value of `-1`.
- **`pred`**: Similarly, `pred[i]` will contain the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree for all nodes `i` that are reachable from node 1. Nodes that are not reachable will retain their initial value of `None`.

If the loop does not execute at all (e.g., if the graph is disconnected and there are nodes unreachable from node 1), the values of `dep` and `pred` will remain as their initial values (`dep[i] = -1` and `pred[i] = None` for unreachable nodes).
