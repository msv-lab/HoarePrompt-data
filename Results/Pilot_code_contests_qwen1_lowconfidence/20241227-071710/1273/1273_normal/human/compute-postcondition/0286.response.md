The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the queue `q` and assigns it to the variable `cur`. This changes the value of `cur` but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is either `center` or the last node that satisfied the conditions within the loop, `q` does not contain the leftmost element anymore, `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` before the operation, and `to` is the last node that was processed within the loop.**
