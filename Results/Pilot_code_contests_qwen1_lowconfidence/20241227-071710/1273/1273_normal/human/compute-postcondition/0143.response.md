The code snippet `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `dep[i]` and `e[i]`, only that `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 1. Since the values of `dep[i]` and `e[i]` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `deg[dep[i]]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `bad` is in its previous state, `deg[dep[2]]` is `len(e[2])`**
