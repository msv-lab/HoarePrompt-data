According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `to` and the list `e[cur]`. The loop iterates over each vertex in `e[cur]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `q` contains the new `to` value.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **`e[1]`**: Since `e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, and we just processed one vertex (the current `to`), it still must contain at least one vertex for the loop to continue.
2. **`dep[to]`**: The value of `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` for the current `to`.
3. **`dep[cur]`**: This remains unchanged.
4. **`q`**: It now contains the new `to` value.

Since we are moving to the next vertex in `e[cur]`, let's denote the next vertex as `to_next`.

State: **`e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to_next]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `q` contains the new `to_next` value.**
