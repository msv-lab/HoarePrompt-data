Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables and Their States:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `cur` is updated to the next element in `q`.
   - `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` equals -1.
   - `q` includes the previous elements plus `to`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each `to` in `e[cur]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - For the loop to execute again, we need to determine the new value of `cur` and the condition under which the loop continues.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for to in e[cur]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- After the previous iteration, `cur` was updated to the next element in `q`.
- The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `e[cur]` to iterate over.

Since `cur` is updated to the next element in `q`, and assuming the loop can continue, `cur` must be the next element in `q`.

**State Adjustment:**
- `cur` will be the next element in `q`.
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `dep[to]` will be set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` equals -1, and `q` will include the previous elements plus `to`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is the next element in `q`, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` equals -1, and `q` includes the previous elements plus `to`.**
