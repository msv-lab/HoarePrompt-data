The code appends the value `v` to the list `e[u]`. Given the initial state, `e[u]` initially contains `[v]`. After appending `v`, `e[u]` will now contain `[v, v]`.

- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- The structure of `e` changes such that `e[u]` now contains `[v, v]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for `e[u]` which contains `[v, v]`**.
