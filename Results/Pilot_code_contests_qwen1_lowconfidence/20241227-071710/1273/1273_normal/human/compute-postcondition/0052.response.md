`cur` is assigned the value of the leftmost element in the queue `q` using the `popleft()` method. After removing the leftmost element, the remaining elements in `q` are still reachable from `cur`. The state of `e[cur]` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it.

Output State: **`q` does not contain the leftmost element, `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` before popleft(), and `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex that is reachable from `cur`**
