The code initializes the list `dep` with `-1` for each index from `0` to `n`. This means that the value of `dep` changes, but none of the other variables are directly affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`center` is the node that is the farthest from node 1 along the shortest path to `end`, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `dep` is initialized to `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `False`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `0`, `end` is the last visited node, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor.**
