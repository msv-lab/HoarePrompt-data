The code `pred[to] = end` updates the value of `pred[to]` to `end`. According to the initial state, `end` is equal to `next_to`, and `pred[to]` was initially 0. So, after executing this line, `pred[to]` will be updated to `next_to`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `q` is a deque containing `next_to`, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0 and `dep[to]` which is 1, and `dep[next_to]` is set to 0. The variable `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[next_to]` which is 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`q` is a deque containing `next_to`, `cur` is 0, `end` is `next_to`, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0 and `dep[to]` which is 1, `dep[next_to]` is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[next_to]` which is 1 and `pred[to]` is `next_to`.**
