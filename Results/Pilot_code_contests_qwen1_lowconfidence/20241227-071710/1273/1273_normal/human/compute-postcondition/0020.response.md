The code `cur = q.popleft()` pops the leftmost element from the deque `q` and assigns it to `cur`. Initially, `q` contains `[1]`, so `cur` will be set to `1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. So, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for the lists `e[u]` and `e[v]` which contain the set of all vertices connected to `u` and `v` respectively; each vertex appears exactly twice (once for each edge connecting it to another vertex); `dep[1]` is `0`, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with each element initialized to `-1`, `q` is a deque containing `[]`, `cur` is `1`**
