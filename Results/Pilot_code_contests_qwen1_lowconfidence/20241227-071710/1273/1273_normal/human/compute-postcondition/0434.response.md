The code initializes a list `deg` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `-1`. This list is not dependent on the values of existing variables like `i`, `n`, `bad`, `center`, `dep`, or `q`. Therefore, only the list `deg` is affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` (where `to` is a node in the graph) is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` is an empty deque, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`.**
