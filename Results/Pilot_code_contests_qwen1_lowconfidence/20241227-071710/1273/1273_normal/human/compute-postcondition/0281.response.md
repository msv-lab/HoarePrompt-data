Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[top]` which is `2` if `len(e[top]) == 2` or `1` otherwise, `cur` is `top`, `q` is an empty list, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.***

Explanation: The if condition checks if `len(e[to]) == 1`. If true, the postcondition sets `dep[top]` accordingly, changes `cur` to `top`, and makes `q` an empty list. Since there is no else part, these are the only changes made, and they apply regardless of the if condition's outcome.
