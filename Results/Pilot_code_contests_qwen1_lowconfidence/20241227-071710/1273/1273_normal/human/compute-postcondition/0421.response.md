`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that for each `to` in `e[cur]`, the value of `dep[to]` changes from `-1` (previously) to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q` after it has been removed, `q` is `q` without its first element, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, `e[cur]` must have at least one element, and for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
