Postcondition: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, which was previously `end` (the last visited node or remains 1), and `end` must have at least one neighbor in the adjacency list `e[end]`, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, and `dep[to]` is equal to -1**
