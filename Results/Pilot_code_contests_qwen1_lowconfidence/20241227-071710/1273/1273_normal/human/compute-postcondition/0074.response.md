The code `end = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `q` and assigns it to `end`. Initially, `q` is `deque([1])`.

- The leftmost element of `q` is `1`.
- After calling `popleft()`, `end` will be set to `1`.
- The deque `q` will be updated to `deque([])` since the leftmost element has been removed.

The other variables (`cur`, `dep`, and `pred`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`q` is deque([]), `cur` is 1, `end` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0; `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0**
