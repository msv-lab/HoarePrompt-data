`dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, otherwise the state remains unchanged. The value of `dep[cur]` is unchanged, and the value of `q` remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, otherwise the state remains unchanged.**
