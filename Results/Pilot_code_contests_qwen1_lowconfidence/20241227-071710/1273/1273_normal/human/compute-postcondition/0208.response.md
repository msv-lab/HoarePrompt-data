Postcondition: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is the queue with either `to` appended to it (if `dep[to] == -1`) or unchanged (if `dep[to] != -1`), `end` is the last visited node, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1 if `dep[to] == -1`**
