The code `end = cur` assigns the current value of `cur` to the variable `end`. The initial value of `cur` is 1. Therefore, `end` will also be 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is deque([1]), `cur` is 1, `end` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0; `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0.**
