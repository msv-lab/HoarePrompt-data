According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `to` within the list `e[end]`. For the loop to execute, `e[end]` must contain at least one element.

Let's break down the initial states:

- `q` is a deque containing an empty list.
- `cur` is 1.
- `end` is 1.
- `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0.
- `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0.

Given these initial states, we need to adjust the state such that `e[end]` contains at least one element. Since `end` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `e[1]` has at least one element.

State: **`q` is deque([]), `cur` is 1, `end` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0, `e[1]` must contain at least one element.**
