Output State: **`cur` is `None` (or the loop terminates because there are no more nodes to process), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last visited node, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, and `bad` is `False` if the entire graph is reachable from node 1, otherwise `True`.**
