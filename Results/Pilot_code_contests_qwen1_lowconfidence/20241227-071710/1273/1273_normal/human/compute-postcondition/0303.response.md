The line of code `top = to` assigns the value of `to` to the variable `top`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The value of `top` is now the same as the previous value of `to`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is the value of `to`, `q` is updated based on the value of `top` and the condition on `len(e[to])`, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, and `to` is the next node in `e[cur]`.**
