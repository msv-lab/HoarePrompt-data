`top` is assigned the value 0, and `dep[top]` is updated to 0. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, and `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `-1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `-1`, and `dep[top]` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `-1`, and `dep[top]` is 0.**
