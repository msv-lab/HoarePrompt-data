Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where `dep[to]` is `1`, `q` is a deque containing elements including `1` (since `q` now has an additional element `to`), `cur` is equal to `top`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is no longer `-1`***
