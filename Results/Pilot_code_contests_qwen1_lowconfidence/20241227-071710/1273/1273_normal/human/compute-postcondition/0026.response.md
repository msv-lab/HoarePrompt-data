According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition that `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex. At the end of the last iteration, `e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `q` contains the element `to`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex (this condition is already satisfied based on the given information).
2. The next `to` value must be taken from `e[cur]`.
3. After assigning `to` from `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` should be set to `dep[cur] + 1`.
4. `q` should contain the new `to` value.

Let's summarize the new state:

- `e[1]` must still contain at least one vertex.
- `dep[to]` will be set to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.
- `q` will contain the new `to` value.

To provide the specific values, we need to identify the next `to` value from `e[cur]`. However, since the exact value of `cur` is not specified and the exact value of the next `to` is not provided, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` will be set to `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `q` will contain the new `to` value**.
