`q` is appended with the value of `to`. The value of `to` is `dep[cur] + 1`, which means `q` now contains the last node that was processed within the loop plus the current leftmost element of `q`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is either `center` or the last node that satisfied the conditions within the loop, `q` now contains `q` and `dep[cur] + 1`, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `to` is the last node that was processed within the loop, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
