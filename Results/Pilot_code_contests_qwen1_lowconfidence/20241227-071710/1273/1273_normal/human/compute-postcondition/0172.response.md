Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `center` is the node that is the farthest from node 1 along the shortest path to `end`.
- `i` is the number of times the loop has executed.
- `dep` is initialized to `[-1] * (n + 1)`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `bad` is `False`.
- `q` is a deque containing one less element than before (the leftmost element has been popped).
- `cur` is now the value of the leftmost element in `q`.
- `end` is the last visited node.
- `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree.
- `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor.
- `dep[end]` is `0`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for to in e[cur]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `cur`:**
   - `cur` is the current node being processed.
   - The loop iterates over the neighbors (`to`) of `cur`.
   - Therefore, `cur` must be a valid node, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one neighbor for the loop to execute.

2. **Variable `e`:**
   - `e` is likely an adjacency list representing the graph.
   - `e[cur]` should be non-empty for the loop to execute.
   - Hence, `e[cur]` must have at least one element.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - Other variables like `i`, `dep`, `n`, `bad`, `q`, `cur`, `end`, `pred`, `deg`, and `dep[end]` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute. They might change during the loop execution but are not prerequisites for the loop to run.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `e[cur]` contains at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `dep` is initialized to `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `False`, `q` is a deque containing one less element than before (the leftmost element has been popped), `cur` is now the value of the leftmost element in `q`, `end` is the last visited node, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, `dep[end]` is `0`, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.**

So, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
**`e[cur]` must contain at least one element.**
