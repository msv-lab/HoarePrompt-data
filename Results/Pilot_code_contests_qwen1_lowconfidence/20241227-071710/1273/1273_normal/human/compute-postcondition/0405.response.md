The code sets the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `e[cur]` is non-empty,
- `q` contains at least two nodes,
- `dep[to]` is equal to -1.

After executing the line `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1`, the value of `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`e[cur]` is non-empty, `q` contains at least two nodes, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
