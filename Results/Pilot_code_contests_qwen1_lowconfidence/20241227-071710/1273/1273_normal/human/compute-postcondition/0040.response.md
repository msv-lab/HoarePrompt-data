The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`, `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1` and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.**
