Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` (where `to` is a node in the graph) is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` is an empty deque, and the loop has executed until all nodes reachable from `top` have been processed.**
