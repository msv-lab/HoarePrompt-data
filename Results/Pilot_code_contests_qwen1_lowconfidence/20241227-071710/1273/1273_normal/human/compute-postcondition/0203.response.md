The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the queue `q` and assigns it to `cur`. Since `q` must be non-empty, there is an element in `q` that gets removed and assigned to `cur`. The other variables (`dep` and `end`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is the queue with its leftmost element removed, and `end` is the last visited node.**
