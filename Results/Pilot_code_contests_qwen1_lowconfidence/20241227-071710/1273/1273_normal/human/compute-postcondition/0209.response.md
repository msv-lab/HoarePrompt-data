Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed).
   - `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree.
   - `q` is the queue with either `to` appended to it (if `dep[to] == -1`) or unchanged (if `dep[to] != -1`).
   - `end` is the last visited node.
   - `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
   - `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to] == -1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for to in e[cur]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over all elements in `e[cur]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since we know `e[cur]` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, the only change needed is to update the value of `cur` to the next leftmost element of `q` (after it has been removed) and ensure `e[cur]` still contains at least one element.

5. **New State:**
   - `cur` will now be the next leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed).
   - `dep` remains unchanged.
   - `q` may have `to` appended to it if `dep[to] == -1`.
   - `end` remains unchanged.
   - `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element.
   - `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to] == -1`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is the queue with either `to` appended to it (if `dep[to] == -1`) or unchanged (if `dep[to] != -1`), `end` is the last visited node, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1 if `dep[to] == -1`**.
