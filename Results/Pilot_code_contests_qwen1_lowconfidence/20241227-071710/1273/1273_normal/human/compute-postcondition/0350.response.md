Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 3`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`, `to` becomes the next element in `e[cur]`, `q` is either `[... , to]` or an empty list, `dep[center]` is 0, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `len(e[to]) == 2`, otherwise it is determined based on the value of `dep[cur]`, and `top` is updated if necessary, and if `len(e[to]) == 1`, the loop or if statement is broken.***
