The code `top = to` assigns the value of `to` to `top`. Given the initial state, `to` is an index such that `dep[to] == -1`, and no other changes are made to the variables in this line of code. Therefore, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is `to`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `center`, `to` is an index such that `dep[to] == -1`, and `e[cur]` contains at least one element, `len(e[to])` is equal to `1`**.
