The code initializes `dep` as a list of length \( n + 1 \) filled with `-1`. This means that every element in `dep` is set to `-1`. The initial state of `q` being an empty deque and `cur` being the initial value of `1` remains unchanged by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `cur` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1.**
