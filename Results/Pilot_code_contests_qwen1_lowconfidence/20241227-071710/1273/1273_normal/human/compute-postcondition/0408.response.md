Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `e[cur]` is non-empty.
- `q` contains at least three nodes.
- Either `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1` or `dep[to]` remains unchanged (since there is no else part).

### For Loop:
```python
for to in e[cur]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `cur`**: This variable does not change within the loop, so its value remains the same from one iteration to the next.
2. **Variable `e[cur]`**: This is the adjacency list for node `cur`. Since `e[cur]` is non-empty at the end of the previous iteration, it means there are at least one or more neighbors (`to`) of `cur`.
3. **Variable `q`**: This queue contains at least three nodes at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `q` must still contain at least three nodes.
4. **Variable `dep[to]`**: The condition given is that `dep[to]` is either equal to `dep[cur] + 1` or remains unchanged. This condition ensures that the depth of `to` is correctly calculated as a neighbor of `cur`.

### State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- Since `e[cur]` is non-empty, it implies that `to` is one of the neighbors of `cur` and is valid to be processed.
- For the loop to execute again, `q` must still contain at least three nodes. Therefore, `q` should be modified to ensure it still has at least three nodes.
- The condition on `dep[to]` is already satisfied since it is either `dep[cur] + 1` or unchanged.

### Updated States:
- `e[cur]` remains non-empty.
- `q` must contain at least three nodes.
- `dep[to]` is either `dep[cur] + 1` or unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`e[cur]` is non-empty, `q` must contain at least three nodes, and `dep[to]` is either `dep[cur] + 1` or unchanged.**
