`dep[cur]` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `cur` is `1`, so `dep[1]` becomes `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `cur` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0; `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0.**
