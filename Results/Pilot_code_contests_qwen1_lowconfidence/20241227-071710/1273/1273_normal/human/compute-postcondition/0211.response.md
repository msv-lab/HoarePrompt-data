`q` is appended with the value `to`. The value of `cur` remains the next leftmost element of `q` after it was removed, `dep` remains the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `end` remains the last visited node, `e[cur]` still contains at least one element, and `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is the queue with `to` appended to it, `end` is the last visited node, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1**.
