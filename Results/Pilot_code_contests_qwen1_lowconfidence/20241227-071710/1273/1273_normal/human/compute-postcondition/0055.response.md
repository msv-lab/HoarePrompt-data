The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the value of `dep[cur]`. According to the initial state, `dep[cur]` must have been previously set to -1 (since `dep[to]` is set to the current depth, which was previously -1).

Given this, the value of `dep[cur]` is -1, so `dep[to]` will be `-1 + 1`, which is 0.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`q` does not contain the leftmost element, `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` before `popleft()`, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex that is reachable from `cur`; `dep[cur]` is -1; `dep[to]` is 0.**
