The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement is part of, the variables remain unchanged, and the program simply exits the current block.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which is `2` if `len(e[to]) == 2` or `1` otherwise, `cur` is `center`, `q` is an empty list, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `top` is `to`.**
