The code `pred[to] = end` updates the `pred` dictionary such that the key `to` is mapped to the value `end`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `pred` dictionary.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `cur` is 0, `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `pred` has updated values for the newly processed `to` with `pred[to] = end`, and `q` has the updated state with `to` appended to it on the right side.**
