`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `dep[cur]` is `0` (since `dep[to]` was initially `-1` and now it is updated). Therefore, `dep[to]` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `1`, `dep[to]` is `1`, `q` is a deque containing elements except `top`, `cur` is equal to `top`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is no longer `-1`**
