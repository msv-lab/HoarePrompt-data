The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, `dep[cur]` is equal to `deg[dep[i]]`, and since `dep[i]` is `n + 1`, `deg[n + 1]` is either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated). However, the exact value of `deg[n + 1]` is not specified, so we will keep it in its general form.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated values are:
- `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is either `center` or the last node that satisfied the conditions within the loop, `q` does not contain the leftmost element anymore, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `to` is the last node that was processed within the loop, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**.
