The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. The variable `to` is previously defined and its value is `1` (since `dep[to]` was `1`). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `-1` except `dep[to]` which is `1`, `q` is a deque containing elements including `1` (since `q` now has an additional element `to`), `cur` is equal to `top`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is no longer `-1`**
