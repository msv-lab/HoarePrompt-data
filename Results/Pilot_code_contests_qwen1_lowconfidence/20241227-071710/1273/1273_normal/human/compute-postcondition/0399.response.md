Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` remains unchanged except for `dep[top]` which is now `dep[top] + 1`, `q` is a list with its last element being `to`, `cur` is equal to `top`, `e[top]` must contain at least one element. If `dep[to] == -1`, then `dep[top]` is incremented by 1.***
