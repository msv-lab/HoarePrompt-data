To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and analyze each part step-by-step:

### Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `bad` is `False`.
- The values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated).
- `top` is either `center` or `to`.
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `cur` is `center`.
- `to` is an index such that `dep[to] == -1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `to` in `e[cur]`.

### Conditions within the Loop:
- If `len(e[to])` is `2`, `dep[to]` is set to `1` and `q` is updated to contain `[to]`.
- If `len(e[to])` is `1`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and `top` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `e[cur]` that have `dep[to] == -1`. This means we need to ensure that the next `to` value satisfies this condition.

2. **Current State of `cur`**: Since `cur` is `center`, the loop will start iterating over `to` in `e[center]`.

3. **Initial Value of `to`**: The problem does not specify the exact initial value of `to` but mentions that it is chosen such that `dep[to] == -1`.

4. **Possible Changes in the Loop**:
   - If `len(e[to])` is `2`, `dep[to]` is set to `1` and `q` is updated to contain `[to]`.
   - If `len(e[to])` is `1`, the loop exits.

Given these points, for the loop to continue executing, `to` must satisfy `dep[to] == -1` and `len(e[to])` should be `2` (since `len(e[to])` being `1` would exit the loop).

### Updated States:
- `dep` will be modified such that `dep[to]` is set to `1`.
- `q` will be updated to contain `[to]`.
- `cur` will remain `center` unless the loop condition is no longer met.
- `to` will change to the next element in `e[cur]` that satisfies `dep[to] == -1`.

### Final States:
- `dep` will have `dep[to]` set to `1`.
- `q` will contain `[to]`.
- `cur` remains `center`.
- `to` changes to the next valid value in `e[cur]` that meets the condition.

### Answer:
State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which is `1`, `q` contains `[to]`, `cur` is `center`, `to` is the next index in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to] == -1`**.

This ensures that the loop can continue executing based on the updated states.
