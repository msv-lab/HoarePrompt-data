The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is in. Since there is no loop or conditional statement mentioned that would be affected by this `break` statement, the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is True, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` is an empty deque, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
