`q` is modified by appending `to` to it. The value of `cur` is no longer relevant since it was only used before the append operation. The value of `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is updated to be equal to `dep[cur] + 1`. The state of `q` is now `q` without its first element plus `to`.

Output State: **`cur` is no longer defined, `q` is the original `q` without its first element plus `to`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
