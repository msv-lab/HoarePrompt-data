To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `q` is non-empty (`while q:`). This means the loop will continue until the deque `q` becomes empty.

2. **Current State**:
   - \( e \) is a list with \( n + 1 \) elements, where each element is an empty list except for the lists \( e[u] \) and \( e[v] \), which contain the set of all vertices connected to \( u \) and \( v \) respectively; each vertex appears exactly twice.
   - \( \text{dep}[1] = 0 \).
   - \( \text{dep} \) is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where for all vertices \( v \) reachable from \( 1 \), \( \text{dep}[v] \) is correctly set to \( \text{dep}[1] + \text{distance from } 1 \text{ to } v \).
   - \( q \) is a deque containing all vertices that are reachable from \( 1 \) in the order they were discovered (level-order traversal).
   - \( \text{cur} \) is the last vertex processed by the loop, and \( i \) is now \(-1\) because the loop condition \( \text{cur} < n \) will no longer be true.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, the algorithm processes a vertex from the front of the deque \( q \).
   - After processing a vertex, its neighbors are added to the back of the deque \( q \) if they have not been visited yet.

Given that \( q \) is a deque containing all vertices in the order they were discovered, and the loop continues as long as \( q \) is non-empty, we need to ensure that there are still vertices in \( q \) for the next iteration.

### Analysis:
- Since \( q \) is a deque containing all reachable vertices in level-order, the only way the loop would stop is if \( q \) becomes empty.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, \( q \) must not be empty at the start of the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
The state that needs adjustment is ensuring that \( q \) is not empty at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the necessary state adjustment is:

State: **\( q \) is a deque containing at least one vertex.**

This ensures that the loop can continue to the next iteration.
