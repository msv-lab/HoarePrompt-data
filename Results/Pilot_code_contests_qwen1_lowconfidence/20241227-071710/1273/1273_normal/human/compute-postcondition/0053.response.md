Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as follows:
   - `q` does not contain the leftmost element.
   - `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` before `popleft()`.
   - `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex that is reachable from `cur`.

2. **Loop Analysis**: The loop iterates over the elements in `e[cur]`. For the loop to execute, `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex.

3. **State Adjustment**: We need to ensure that `e[cur]` contains at least one vertex for the loop to execute. The other conditions (`q` not containing the leftmost element and `cur` being the leftmost element of `q` before `popleft()`) are already satisfied by the context of the problem and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex that is reachable from `cur`.

State: **`q` does not contain the leftmost element, `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` before popleft(), and `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex that is reachable from `cur`**
