To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and the initial states provided.

### Initial States:
- `cur` is `None`
- `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree
- `q` is an empty deque
- `end` is the last visited node
- `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree
- `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is `-1`
- `bad` is `False`

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over values from 1 to \( n \).
   - Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` must be initialized to 1.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop runs until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - Hence, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1).

3. **Variables `cur`, `dep`, `q`, `end`, `pred`, `deg`, `bad`:**
   - These variables do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself.
   - Their values can be adjusted during the loop execution, but they do not need to be explicitly set at the start for the loop to run.

### Conclusion:
The critical states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
