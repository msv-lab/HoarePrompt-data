The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or conditional block it is inside. In this case, it does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or conditional block was exited. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is `to`, `q` is empty, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `to` is the last node that was processed within the loop, `dep[to]` equals -1, `len(e[to])` is not equal to 2, and the length of `e[to]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
