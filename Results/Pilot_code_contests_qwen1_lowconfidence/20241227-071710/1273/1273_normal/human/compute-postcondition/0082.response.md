The code snippet `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` impacts the `dep` list by setting the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[end] + 1`. Given the initial state, `end` is equal to `next_to`, so `dep[end]` is `0`. Therefore, `dep[to]` will be set to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`q` is deque containing `next_to`, `cur` is 0, `end` is `next_to`, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0 and `dep[to]` which is 1, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[next_to]` which is 1, and `dep[next_to]` is set to 0.**
