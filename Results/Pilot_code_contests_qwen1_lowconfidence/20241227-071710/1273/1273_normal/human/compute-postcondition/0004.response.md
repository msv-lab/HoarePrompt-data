`e[u]` is appended with `v`. Since `u` is an integer from input and `v` is an integer from input, the value of `e[u]` will become a list containing `v`. The initial value of `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list. The values of `n`, `i`, and `u` and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for `e[u]` which contains `[v]`, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input**
