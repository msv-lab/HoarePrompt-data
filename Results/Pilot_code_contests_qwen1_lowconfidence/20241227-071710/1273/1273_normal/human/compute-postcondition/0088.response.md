The code `pred[to] = end` updates the value of `pred[to]` to be equal to `end`. According to the initial state, `end` is `next_to`. Therefore, `pred[to]` is updated to `next_to`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. So, the output state is:

Output State: **`q` is a deque containing either `next_to` and `to` or just `next_to`, `cur` is 0, `end` is `next_to`, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0, `dep[to]` is 1, `dep[next_to]` is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[next_to]` which is 1 and `pred[to]` is `next_to`, `to` is the next element in `e[next_to]`, and `pred[to]` is updated to `next_to`.**
