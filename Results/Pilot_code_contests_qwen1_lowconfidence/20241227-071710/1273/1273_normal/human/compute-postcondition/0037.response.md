According to the given for loop, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur` and the edges `e[cur]`.

- The `cur` variable represents the current vertex being processed.
- The `e[cur]` represents the adjacency list of the current vertex `cur`, containing all the vertices that are directly connected to `cur`.

Before the loop starts, we know that:
- `q` is a deque with at least one less vertex.
- `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`.

For the loop to execute, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element (vertex). This ensures that there is at least one adjacent vertex to `cur` that the loop can iterate over.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `e[cur]` contains at least one element.

State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex, `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.**
