Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed).
- `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree.
- `q` is the queue with its leftmost element removed.
- `end` is the last visited node.

### For Loop:
```
for to in e[cur]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`cur`**: The variable `cur` is set to the leftmost element of the queue `q` after it was removed. This means `cur` is the node that was just dequeued from `q`.
2. **`e[cur]`**: This is an adjacency list where `e[cur]` represents the neighbors of node `cur`. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one neighbor of `cur`.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each neighbor `to` of `cur`. Therefore, the loop can only execute if `e[cur]` is non-empty.

### Necessary Adjustments:
- Since the loop requires that `e[cur]` is non-empty (i.e., there are neighbors for `cur`), we need to ensure that `e[cur]` contains at least one element.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state before the loop should include the condition that `e[cur]` is non-empty.

**State:**
- `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed).
- `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree.
- `q` is the queue with its leftmost element removed.
- `end` is the last visited node.
- `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is the queue with its leftmost element removed, `end` is the last visited node, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element**.
