According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is a deque containing all nodes that need further exploration. For the loop to be executed one more time, `q` must contain at least one node.

Given that `cur` is a node that has no unvisited neighbors, `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is a deque containing all nodes that need further exploration, and `end` is the last visited node, no adjustments are necessary for these variables to ensure that the loop can execute again as long as `q` is non-empty.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `q` must be non-empty.

State: **`cur` is a node that has no unvisited neighbors, `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` must be non-empty, and `end` is the last visited node.**
