The variable `bad` is assigned the value `False`. This changes the value of `bad` from its previous state (which was dependent on whether the entire graph was reachable from node 1) to explicitly `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is `None`, `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last visited node, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is `-1`, and `bad` is `False`.**
