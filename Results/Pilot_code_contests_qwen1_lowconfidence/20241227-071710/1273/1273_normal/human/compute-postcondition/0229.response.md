Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `deg[dep[1]]` is `-1`, no change is made to the variables. Otherwise, if `deg[dep[1]]` is not equal to the length of `e[1]`, `bad` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.***
