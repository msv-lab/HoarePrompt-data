Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is at least 1
   - If `deg[dep[i]]` equals `-1`, no change to the variables.
   - Otherwise, if `deg[deg[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`, then `bad` is set to `True`.
   - Otherwise, no change to the `bad` variable.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.

3. **Next Iteration**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, which means `i` should be incremented by 1 from the current value.

4. **Check Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Update Variables**:
   - Since we are starting a new iteration, `i` will be incremented to `i = 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (at least 1).
   - `deg[dep[i]]` and `e[i]` will be checked again in this new iteration.
   - If `deg[dep[i]]` equals `-1`, `bad` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`, `bad` will be set to `True`.
   - If `deg[dep[i]]` is equal to the length of `e[i]`, `bad` remains unchanged.

6. **Conclusion**: The only thing that changes is the value of `i`, which is now 2. The condition for `n` and the state of `bad` remain as they were until the next check.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is at least 1
- `bad` is in its previous state (either unchanged or set to `True` based on the previous iteration).

The final state is:
**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `bad` is in its previous state**.
