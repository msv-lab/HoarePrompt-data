Postcondition: ***`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`, `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition is simply the postcondition of the if part. After executing the if statement, `q` contains at least one less vertex (plus the value of `to`), `cur` remains the same, `e[cur]` still contains at least one element, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.
