The code updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to the length of `e[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `deg[dep[i]]` is -1. Since `i` is 1, `dep[i]` would be `dep[1]`. The code does not provide the value of `e[i]`, so let's denote its length as `len(e[1])`.

The value of `deg[dep[i]]` is updated to `len(e[i])`, which means `deg[dep[1]]` becomes `len(e[1])`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `deg[dep[1]]` is `len(e[1])`**
