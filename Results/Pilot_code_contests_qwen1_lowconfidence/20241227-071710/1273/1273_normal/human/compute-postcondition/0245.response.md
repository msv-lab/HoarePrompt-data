The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. Since the program is terminated, no further assignments or operations are performed, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `print()` outputs `None`**
