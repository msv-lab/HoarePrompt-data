To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initial State
- \( n \) is a positive integer.
- \( i \) is \( n - 1 \).
- \( e \) is a list with \( n + 1 \) elements, where each element is an empty list except for the lists \( e[u] \) and \( e[v] \), which contain the set of all vertices connected to \( u \) and \( v \) respectively; each vertex appears exactly twice.
- \( \text{dep}[1] = 0 \).
- \( \text{dep} \) is a list of length \( n + 1 \) with each element initialized to \(-1\).
- \( q \) is a deque containing `[]`.
- \( \text{cur} = 1 \).

#### Loop Code
```python
for to in e[cur]:
    if dep[to] == -1:
        dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1
        q.append(to)
```

#### Observations from Provided Output States
1. **Output State after the loop executes 1 time**:
   - \( e[1] \) must contain at least one vertex.
   - \( \text{dep}[to] \) is equal to \( \text{dep}[cur] + 1 \).
   - \( \text{dep}[cur] \) remains unchanged.
   - \( q \) contains the element \( to \).

2. **Output State after the loop executes 2 times**:
   - \( e[1] \) must contain at least one vertex.
   - \( \text{dep}[to] \) is set to \( \text{dep}[cur] + 1 \).
   - \( \text{dep}[cur] \) remains unchanged.
   - \( q \) contains the new \( to \) value, regardless of whether \( \text{dep}[to] \) was initially equal to \(-1\) or not.

3. **Output State after the loop executes 3 times**:
   - \( e[1] \) must contain at least one vertex.
   - \( \text{dep}[to] \) is set to \( \text{dep}[cur] + 1 \).
   - \( \text{dep}[cur] \) remains unchanged.
   - \( q \) contains the original elements plus the new \( to \) value.

### Final Output State

After the loop has executed all necessary iterations (i.e., for each vertex connected to the starting vertex \(1\)), the following conditions will hold:

- All vertices that are reachable from \(1\) will have their depths set correctly. Specifically, for any vertex \(v\), \( \text{dep}[v] \) will be \( \text{dep}[1] + \text{distance from } 1 \text{ to } v \).
- The queue \(q\) will contain all the vertices that are reachable from \(1\) in the order they were discovered (a level-order traversal starting from \(1\)).
- The original values of \( \text{dep} \) and \( \text{cur} \) will remain unchanged until the loop completes its iterations.
- The list \( e \) will remain unchanged as well since the loop only updates the depth and queue.

### Conclusion
The final output state of the loop after all iterations will be:

**Output State:**
- \( e \) is a list with \( n + 1 \) elements, where each element is an empty list except for the lists \( e[u] \) and \( e[v] \), which contain the set of all vertices connected to \( u \) and \( v \) respectively; each vertex appears exactly twice.
- \( \text{dep}[1] = 0 \).
- \( \text{dep} \) is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where for all vertices \( v \) reachable from \( 1 \), \( \text{dep}[v] \) is correctly set to \( \text{dep}[1] + \text{distance from } 1 \text{ to } v \).
- \( q \) is a deque containing all vertices that are reachable from \( 1 \) in the order they were discovered (level-order traversal).
- \( \text{cur} \) is the last vertex processed by the loop, and \( i \) is now \(-1\) because the loop condition \( \text{cur} < n \) will no longer be true.

Thus, the output state is:

**Output State: **\( e \) is a list with \( n + 1 \) elements, where each element is an empty list except for the lists \( e[u] \) and \( e[v] \), which contain the set of all vertices connected to \( u \) and \( v \) respectively; each vertex appears exactly twice. \( \text{dep} \) is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where for all vertices \( v \) reachable from \( 1 \), \( \text{dep}[v] \) is correctly set to \( \text{dep}[1] + \text{distance from } 1 \text{ to } v \). \( q \) is a deque containing all vertices that are reachable from \( 1 \) in the order they were discovered (level-order traversal). \( \text{cur} \) is the last vertex processed by the loop, and \( i \) is now \(-1\).
