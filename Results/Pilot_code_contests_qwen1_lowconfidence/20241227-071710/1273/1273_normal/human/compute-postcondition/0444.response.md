Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is either False or True, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` is an empty deque, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`. If `deg[dep[i]]` is equal to the length of `e[i]`, then `deg[dep[i]]` is set to this length. Otherwise, `bad` is set to True.***
