The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the queue `q`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `q` now containing `cur` followed by the next leftmost element and then `to`.

Output State: **`dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` (after `to` is appended), `q` is the queue with `cur` replaced by the next leftmost element and `to` appended, `dep` is updated such that `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was previously `-1`, `end` remains the same as the previous state, `e[cur]` still contains at least one element, and `q` now includes `cur` followed by the next leftmost element and then `to`.**
