The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` by adding 1 to the current value of `dep[cur]`. Given the initial conditions, `dep[cur]` is `0`, so `dep[to]` will become `1`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which is now `1`; `cur` is `center`; `q` contains `[to, to]` if `len(e[to]) == 2` or remains as specified, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.**
