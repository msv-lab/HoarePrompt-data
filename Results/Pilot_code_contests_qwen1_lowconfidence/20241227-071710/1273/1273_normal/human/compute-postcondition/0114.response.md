Postcondition: ***`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being a node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, and `e[end]` is not an empty list. Additionally, the current value of `dep[to]` is -1.***
