Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop runs based on the variable `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(n - 1)`, meaning the loop will run from `0` to `n-2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `n` is the integer value of the input, representing the number of vertices in the tree.
   - `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop `for i in range(n - 1)` to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1 (i.e., `n >= 2`).
   - This ensures that there is at least one iteration in the loop.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 because if `n < 2`, the loop will not execute.
   - `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-2`, so before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.
   - The list `e` remains as given: a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list.

Therefore, the required states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` must be 0.
- `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list.

Final Answer:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list**
