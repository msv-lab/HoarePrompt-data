`u` and `v` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The input is expected to provide two integers separated by a space. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the list `e` remains as it was, which is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input**
