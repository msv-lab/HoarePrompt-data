The code appends the value `to` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `q` initially contains `[to, to]` if `len(e[to]) == 2` or remains as specified. Regardless of the exact specification, the value `to` is appended to `q`.

Therefore, the updated state of `q` is that it contains the elements `[to, to, to]` (since `to` is appended twice).

The other variables (`dep`, `cur`, and `e`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which is `1`; `cur` is `center`; `q` contains `[to, to, to]`; `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.**
