The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. The previous value of `dep[cur]` is unchanged, and the previous value of `dep[to]` is also unchanged before this line of code is executed. After executing this line, `dep[to]` will have the value of `dep[cur] + 1`.

The states of the other variables (`e[1]`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `q` contains the new `to` value**
