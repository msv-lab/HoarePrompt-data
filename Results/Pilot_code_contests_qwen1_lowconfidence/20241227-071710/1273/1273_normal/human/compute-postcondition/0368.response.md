The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is True**
