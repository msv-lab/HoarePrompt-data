To understand the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`).
- `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration.
- `cur` is 0.
- If `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then:
  - `dep[to]` is set to `dep[end] + 1`.
  - `pred[to]` is set to `end`.
  - `to` is appended to `q` on the right side.
- If `dep[to]` was not `-1`, no changes are made.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for to in e[end]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `q` is a deque.
   - The leftmost element of `q` is the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`).
   - `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration.
   - `cur` is 0 (though it seems irrelevant for this analysis).

2. **What the Loop Does:**
   - The loop iterates over each neighbor (`to`) of the node `end` in the adjacency list `e[end]`.

3. **Conditions for Adding a Node to the Queue:**
   - If `dep[to]` is initially `-1`, then:
     - `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`.
     - `pred[to]` is set to `end`.
     - `to` is appended to `q` on the right side.
   - If `dep[to]` is not `-1`, no changes are made to `dep[to]` or `pred[to]`, and `to` is not added to `q`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the leftmost element of `q` must still be a node with an unexplored distance from node 1.
   - This means there must be at least one node in `e[end]` that was not previously explored or was explored but does not have its shortest distance yet set.

### State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:

Given that the leftmost element of `q` is the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), we need to ensure that there is at least one node in `e[end]` that meets the condition of having `dep[to]` initially set to `-1` so that it can be added to `q`.

Therefore, the state adjustment would be:
- `q` remains a deque.
- The leftmost element of `q` is the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`).
- `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration.
- There must be at least one node in `e[end]` such that `dep[to]` is initially `-1`.

### Final State:
State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, and there must be at least one node in `e[end]` such that `dep[to]` is initially `-1`.**
