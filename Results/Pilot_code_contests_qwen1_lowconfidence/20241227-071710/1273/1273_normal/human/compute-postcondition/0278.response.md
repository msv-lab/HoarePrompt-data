The variable `top` is assigned the value of `to`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, but it changes the value of `top` to `to`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which is `2` if `len(e[to]) == 2` or `1` otherwise, `cur` is `center`, `q` contains `[to, to]` if `len(e[to]) == 2` or remains as specified, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `top` is `to`.**
