The code sets `dep[end]` to 0. This means the distance from the end node to itself is 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `center` is the node that is the farthest from node 1 along the shortest path to `end`
- `i` is the number of times the loop has executed
- `dep` is initialized to `[-1] * (n + 1)`
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `bad` is `False`
- `q` is an empty deque
- `cur` is `0`
- `end` is the last visited node
- `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree
- `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor
- `dep[end]` is now `0`

Output State: **`center` is the node that is the farthest from node 1 along the shortest path to `end`, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `dep` is initialized to `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `False`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `0`, `end` is the last visited node, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, `dep[end]` is `0`.**
