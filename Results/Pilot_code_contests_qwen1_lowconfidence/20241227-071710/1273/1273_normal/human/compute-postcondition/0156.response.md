The code prints the current value of `cur`, which is `0`. The print statement does not assign any new value to any variable; it simply outputs the current value of `cur`. Therefore, the value of `cur` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `False`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `0`, `end` is the last visited node, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor.**
