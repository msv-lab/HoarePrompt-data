The code initializes a list `dep` with a length of `n + 1` and assigns `-1` to each element in this list. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or the contents of the list `e`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for the lists `e[u]` and `e[v]` which contain the set of all vertices connected to `u` and `v` respectively, where each vertex appears exactly twice (once for each edge connecting it to another vertex); `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with each element initialized to `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for the lists `e[u]` and `e[v]` which contain the set of all vertices connected to `u` and `v` respectively, where each vertex appears exactly twice (once for each edge connecting it to another vertex); `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with each element initialized to `-1`.**
