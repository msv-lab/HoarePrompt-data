The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[end] + 1`. Here, `dep[end]` is the current value of `dep` at the index `end`. This operation affects only the `dep` dictionary.

Given the initial state:
- `q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated or removed.
- `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal.
- `cur` is 0.
- `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update (or updated if `dep[to]` was set to `dep[end] + 1`).

After executing the line of code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1`, the value of `dep[to]` is updated to be `dep[end] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated or removed, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, `cur` is 0, `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update, `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`.**
