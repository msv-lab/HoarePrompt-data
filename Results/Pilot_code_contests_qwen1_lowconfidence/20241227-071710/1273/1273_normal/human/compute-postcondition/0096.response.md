The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]`. According to the initial state, `dep[to]` is equal to -1. The new value of `dep[to]` will be `dep[end] + 1`.

Given that `dep[end]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `end` and `to` is a neighbor of `end`, the new value of `dep[to]` will be one more than `dep[end]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, `end` must have at least one neighbor in the adjacency list `e[end]`, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i` with `dep[to]` updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`.**
