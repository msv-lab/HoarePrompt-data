`end` is assigned the value of the leftmost element in `q` using `popleft()`, which removes that element from `q`. The value of `cur` remains unchanged, `dep` and `pred` remain unchanged, and `q` now contains all elements except the leftmost one, which was removed and assigned to `end`. 

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being a node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, and `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree.**
