According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `to` within the adjacency list `e[cur]`. The loop will execute for each `to` in `e[cur]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is the first element of `q` after it has been removed, `q` is `q` without its first element plus `to`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next `to` in the adjacency list `e[cur]`. Since `cur` is fixed and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, the only thing that changes is the `to` value.

Let's assume `e[cur]` has multiple elements (let's call them `to1`, `to2`, etc.). After processing one `to`, the next `to` would be the next element in the adjacency list. For simplicity, let's denote the next `to` as `to_next`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `to` becomes `to_next` in the next iteration.

State: **`cur` is the first element of `q` after it has been removed, `q` is `q` without its first element plus `to_next`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and for all `to_next` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to_next]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
