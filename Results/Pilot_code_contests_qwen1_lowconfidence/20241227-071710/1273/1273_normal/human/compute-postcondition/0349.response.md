Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 3`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`, `to` becomes the next element in `e[cur]`, `q` is an empty list, `dep[center]` is 0, `dep[to]` is determined based on the value of `dep[cur]`, and `top` is equal to `to`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, we break out of the nearest loop or if statement.***
