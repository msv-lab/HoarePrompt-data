The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement present in the given code snippet, the break statement does not change any variable values. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, and the degree of the dependency at index `i` in the `deg` list is not equal to -1, and the current value of `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`; `bad` is True**
