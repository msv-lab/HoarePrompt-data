`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`. The value of `to` is appended to the right end of the deque `q`. The values of `cur`, `e[cur]`, and `dep[to]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`, `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`; `q` is updated by appending `to` to the right end**
