The code `u, v = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `u` and `v`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for `e[u]` which contains `[v]`.

After executing the code:
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these variables.
- The values of `u` and `v` are assigned the integers read from the input.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for `e[u]` which contains `[v]`.
- `u` is an integer read from the input.
- `v` is an integer read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for `e[u]` which contains `[v]`, `u` is an integer read from the input, `v` is an integer read from the input.**
