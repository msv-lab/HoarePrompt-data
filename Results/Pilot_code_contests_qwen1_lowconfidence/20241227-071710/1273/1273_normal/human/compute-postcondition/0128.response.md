Postcondition: ***`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`). If `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `to` is added to `q` as its rightmost element, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[end] + 1`, and `pred[to]` is set to `end`. There is no change to `q` and other variables if `dep[to]` is not `-1`.***
