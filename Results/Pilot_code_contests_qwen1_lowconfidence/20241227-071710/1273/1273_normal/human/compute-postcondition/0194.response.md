`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that the value of `dep[to]` is increased by 1 compared to the value of `dep[cur]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is a valid node that exists in the graph and has at least one neighbor; `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is a valid node that exists in the graph and has at least one neighbor; `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
