The code sets the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Based on the initial state, `dep[cur]` is known, and adding 1 to it gives the new value for `dep[to]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is the queue with either `to` appended to it (if `dep[to] == -1`) or unchanged (if `dep[to] != -1`), `end` is the last visited node, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1**.
