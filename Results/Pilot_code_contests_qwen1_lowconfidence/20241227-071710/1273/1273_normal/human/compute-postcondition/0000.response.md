`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, which means `n` will hold the number of vertices in the tree. The initial state also mentions that the input is a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree, but this list is not yet defined or assigned to any variable in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `n` now holds the integer value from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the input, representing the number of vertices in the tree.**
