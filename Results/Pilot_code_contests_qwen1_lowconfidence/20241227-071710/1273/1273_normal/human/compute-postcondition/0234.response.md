Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, then `bad` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `deg[dep[i]]` equals `len(e[i])`, no change is made to `bad` and the most internal loop or if statement continues.***
