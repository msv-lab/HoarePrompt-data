`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. The previous value of `dep[to]` was -1 (since it was set to -1 earlier), so now it is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is the next element in `q`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `q` includes the previous elements plus `to`.**
