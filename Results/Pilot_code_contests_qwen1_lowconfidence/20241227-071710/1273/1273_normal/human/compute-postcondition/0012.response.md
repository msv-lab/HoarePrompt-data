`e[u]` is appended with `v`. Before the append operation, `e[u]` contains `[v, v]`. After appending `v` to `e[u]`, `e[u]` will contain `[v, v, v]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2; `i` is 1; `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for `e[u]` which now contains `[v, v, v]` and `e[v]` which now contains `[u]; `u` is an integer read from input; `v` is an integer read from input.**
