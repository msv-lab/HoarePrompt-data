The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. According to the initial state, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and for all `to_next` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to_next]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`. Since `to` is one of the elements in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q` after it has been removed, `q` is `q` without its first element plus `to_next`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
