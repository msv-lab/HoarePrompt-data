The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. This affects the `q` variable, adding `to` to it. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` is `1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `top` is `center`, `q` is a deque containing `[to]`, `cur` is `center`, `to` is an index such that `dep[to] == -1`, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `len(e[to])` is `2`.**
