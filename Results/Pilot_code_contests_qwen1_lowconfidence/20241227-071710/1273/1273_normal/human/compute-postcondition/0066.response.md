Output State: **`q` is an empty queue, `cur` is the initial leftmost element of `q` before any `popleft()` operations, and `dep` is a dictionary where each vertex `v` that is reachable from the initial `cur` has its depth set to the shortest path distance from `cur` to `v`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` does not contain the leftmost element.
   - `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` before `popleft()`.
   - `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex that is reachable from `cur`.

2. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each `to` in `e[cur]`.
   - If `dep[to] == -1`, it means `to` has not been visited yet.
     - In this case, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, indicating that `to` is a neighbor of `cur` and is at a distance of `dep[cur] + 1` from the starting node.
     - `to` is added to `q` to be processed in the next iteration.

3. **Final State After Loop Execution:**
   - Once all vertices reachable from the initial `cur` have been processed (i.e., all possible paths have been explored), the queue `q` becomes empty.
   - `cur` will eventually become the initial leftmost element of `q` before any `popleft()` operations, as all other elements will have been processed.
   - `dep` will contain the shortest path distances from the initial `cur` to all reachable vertices.

4. **Case Where Loop Does Not Execute:**
   - If `q` is empty initially and does not get populated, the loop will not execute.
   - In this case, `q` remains empty, `cur` remains the initial leftmost element of `q` (which would be `None` if `q` was empty), and `dep` remains unchanged, possibly still containing only the initial condition `dep[cur] == 0` if the initial `cur` was the start of the traversal.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop is as described above.
