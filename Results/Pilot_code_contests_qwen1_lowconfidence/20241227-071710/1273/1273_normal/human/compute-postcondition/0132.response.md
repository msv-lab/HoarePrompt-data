The code `bad = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `bad`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `bad` and retains the values of all other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `cur` is 0, `end` is the last visited node, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is `-1`, and `bad` is `False`.**
