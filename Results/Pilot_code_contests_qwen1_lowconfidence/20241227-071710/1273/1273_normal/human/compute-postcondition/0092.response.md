According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is an empty deque.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `q` is non-empty. Given the information provided about the other variables, no adjustments are needed for `cur`, `end`, `dep`, or `pred`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `q` is non-empty.

State: **`q` is a non-empty deque, `cur` is 0, `end` is the last visited node or remains 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, and `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree**.
