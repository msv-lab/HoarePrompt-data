`q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The variable `cur` remains unchanged, `to` remains the next neighbor in the list `e[cur]`, and `dep[to]` remains `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is a valid node in the graph with at least one neighbor, `to` is the next neighbor in the list `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `q` is a list with `to` appended to it.**
