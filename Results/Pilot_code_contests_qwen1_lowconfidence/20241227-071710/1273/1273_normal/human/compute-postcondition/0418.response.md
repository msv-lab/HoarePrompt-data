The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes the first element from the queue `q` and assigns it to `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `q` loses its first element, but the rest of the queue is still present.
- `cur` is updated to the first element that was removed from `q`.
- `dep[to]` remains equal to `dep[cur] + 1` for all `to` in `e[cur]`.
- `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is the first element of `q` after it has been removed, `q` is `q` without its first element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1` for all `to` in `e[cur]`, and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q` after it has been removed, `q` is `q` without its first element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1` for all `to` in `e[cur]`, and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.**
