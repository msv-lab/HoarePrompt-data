Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0`. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, `dep[to]` is `1`; otherwise, `dep[to]` is `2`. `cur` is either `center` or `top`, and `q` is either `[to, to, to]` or an empty list, depending on the condition of the if statement. `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.**
