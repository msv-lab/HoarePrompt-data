The code initializes a list `dep` with the length of `n + 1` and fills it with `-1`. This operation affects the `dep` variable by assigning it a new list. The values of `i`, `n`, `bad`, and `center` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged (either `False` if there exists any `i` from 1 to `n` where `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, otherwise `bad` remains `False`), `center` is unchanged, and `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `-1`.**
