The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This operation changes the value of `q` but does not affect the other variables.

- `total` remains 0.
- `i` is still `n + 3`.
- `cur` remains the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`.
- `to` becomes the next element in `e[cur]`.
- `q` now includes the value of `to` as its last element.
- `dep[center]` remains 0.
- `dep[to]` remains `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `top` is updated if necessary, but the exact condition for updating is not specified in the given information.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 3`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`, `to` is the next element in `e[cur]`, `q` is `[... , to]`, `dep[center]` is 0, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `top` is updated if necessary.**
