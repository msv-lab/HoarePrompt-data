The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the variable `to` to the deque `q`. This operation modifies the deque `q` by adding `to` to its right side.

Given the initial state:
- `q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`).
- `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration.
- `cur` is 0.
- `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`.
- `pred` has updated values for the newly processed `to` with `pred[to] = end`.

After executing the code `q.append(to)`, the state of `q` changes by appending `to` to its right side.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `cur` is 0, `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `pred` has updated values for the newly processed `to` with `pred[to] = end`, and `q` has `to` appended to it on the right side.**
