Postcondition: ***`q` is a list containing the next leftmost element, `cur`, and `to`; `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`; `to` is the next neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`; and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same whether `dep[to] == -1` or not.***
