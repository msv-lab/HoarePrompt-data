The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]`. Given that `dep[cur]` was previously 0 (since `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` and `dep[center]` is 0, implying `cur` is likely `center`), the value of `dep[cur]` is 0. Therefore, `dep[to]` is updated to `0 + 1`, which is 1.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (and `q` has the leftmost element removed), `to` is undefined, `q` has the leftmost element removed, `dep[center]` is 0, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is 1, and the length of `e[to]` is 2**
