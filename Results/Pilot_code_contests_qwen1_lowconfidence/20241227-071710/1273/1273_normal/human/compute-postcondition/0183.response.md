`q` is a queue, and the code appends `to` to it. This means that `to` is added to the end of the list `q`. The other variables are not directly affected by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is the next element in `q`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `q` now includes all its previous elements plus `to`.**
