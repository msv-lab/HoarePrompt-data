The code snippet appends `to` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `to` is an element from `e[cur]`. Since `e[cur]` must have at least one element and for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, the value of `to` will be an element whose dependency level is `dep[cur] + 1`.

Therefore, after the code execution:
- The list `q` will have its first element removed (which was `cur`) and now has `to` appended to it.
- `cur` remains the first element of the updated `q`.
- `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.
- `e[cur]` remains unchanged.
- For all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is still equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `q` after it has been removed, `q` is `q` without its first element plus `to`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, `e[cur]` remains unchanged, and for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
