The code `e[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `e[v]`. Since `u` is an integer from input, let's denote the specific value of `u` as `u_value` and the specific value of `v` as `v_value`.

Before the code execution:
- `n` is at least 2
- `i` is 0
- `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for `e[u]` which contains `[v]`

After the code execution:
- `e[v_value]` will now contain `[v_value, u_value]` because we appended `u_value` to `e[v_value]`.
- The other elements of `e` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for `e[v_value]` which contains `[v_value, u_value]`**
