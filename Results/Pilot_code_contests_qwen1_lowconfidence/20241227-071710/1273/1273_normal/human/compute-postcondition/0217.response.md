Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (after all elements are removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is an empty queue, `end` is the last visited node, `e[cur]` is an empty adjacency list, and for every node `to` that was processed, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `cur` is the leftmost element of `q`.
   - `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree.
   - `q` is the queue with nodes to be processed.
   - `end` is the last visited node.
   - `e[cur]` is the adjacency list of the current node `cur`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over all neighbors `to` of the current node `cur`.
   - If `dep[to]` is `-1`, it means `to` hasn't been visited yet.
   - The depth of `to` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.
   - The node `to` is added to the queue `q`.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop continues until there are no more elements in the queue `q`.
   - Once the queue is empty, the current node `cur` becomes the leftmost element, which is now the next node to be processed.
   - This process repeats until all reachable nodes from node 1 have been visited and their depths are correctly set.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, the queue `q` is empty because all nodes have been processed.
   - `cur` is the leftmost element of the queue after all elements are removed, indicating that all nodes reachable from node 1 have been visited.
   - `dep` contains the correct depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree.
   - `end` remains the last visited node.
   - `e[cur]` is an empty adjacency list because there are no more nodes to process.

Thus, the final state of the program after the loop has executed all iterations is as described above.
