`deg[dep[i]]` is assigned the value of `len(e[i])`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `deg[dep[2]]` is set to `len(e[2])`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `dep[2]` or `e[2]`, so we can only say that `deg[dep[2]]` is now equal to `len(e[2])`.

The state of `i` and `n` remains unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `i` is still 2, and `n` is still greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `deg[dep[2]]` is `len(e[2])`**
