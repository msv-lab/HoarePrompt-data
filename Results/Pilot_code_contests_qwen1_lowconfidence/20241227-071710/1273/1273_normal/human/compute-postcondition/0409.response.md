`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. The previous value of `dep[to]` was either `dep[cur] + 1` or unchanged, but now it is explicitly set to `dep[cur] + 1`. The other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.

Output State: **`e[cur]` is non-empty, `q` must contain at least three nodes, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` is unchanged.**
