Postcondition: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `dep` is initialized to `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `False`, `q` is a deque containing one less element than before (the leftmost element has been popped), `cur` is now the value of the leftmost element in `q`, `end` is the last visited node with `dep[end]` being `0`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, and `dep[to]` is `-1` indicating that the node `to` has not been visited yet.**
