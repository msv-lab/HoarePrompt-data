Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - If `deg[dep[1]]` equals `-1`, no change to the variables.
   - Otherwise, if `deg[dep[1]]` does not equal `len(e[1])`, then `bad` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no change to the variables.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, meaning the loop has just started or has completed one full iteration from `i = 1` to some point where it either stopped due to the condition or continued based on the value of `n`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented from its current value.
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `2`.

5. **Considering the Condition:**
   - The condition inside the loop involves checking `deg[dep[1]]` and `len(e[1])`.
   - If `deg[dep[1]]` equals `-1`, there is no change to the variables.
   - Otherwise, if `deg[dep[1]]` does not equal `len(e[1])`, `bad` is set to `True` and the loop may be broken.
   - If the loop continues (i.e., it is not broken), no change to the variables occurs.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop is about to execute again, the variables `i` and `n` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The state of `bad` remains unchanged unless the loop condition inside the loop sets it to `True`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged.**
