The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. This means that the list `q` will now contain the original element `[to]` plus the new element `to`. 

Given the initial state:
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0`, `dep[to]` which is `2`.
- `q` contains `[to]`.
- `cur` is `center`.
- `to` is the next index in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to] == -1`.

After executing the code, `q` will be updated to include the new value `to`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0`, `dep[to]` which is `2`; `q` contains `[to, to]`; `cur` is `center`; `to` is the next index in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to] == -1`.**
