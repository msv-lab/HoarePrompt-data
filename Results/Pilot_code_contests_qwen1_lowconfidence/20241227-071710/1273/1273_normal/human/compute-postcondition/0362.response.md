The code `break` does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since no loop or switch statement is specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will break out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and the value of `deg[dep[i]]` is not -1, and the current value of `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`; `bad` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
