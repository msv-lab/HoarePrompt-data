The code initializes a deque object `q` and appends the value `1` to it. This does not change the values of the other variables, but it sets up `q` for potential future use in a breadth-first search or similar algorithm.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for the lists `e[u]` and `e[v]` which contain the set of all vertices connected to `u` and `v` respectively, where each vertex appears exactly twice (once for each edge connecting it to another vertex); `dep[1]` is `0`, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with each element initialized to `-1`, `q` is a deque containing `[1]`.**
