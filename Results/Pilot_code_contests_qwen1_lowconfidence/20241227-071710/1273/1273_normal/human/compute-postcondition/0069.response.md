The code initializes `pred` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. This means that each element in the `pred` list will be set to 0. The values of `q`, `cur`, and `dep` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `cur` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1; `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0.**
