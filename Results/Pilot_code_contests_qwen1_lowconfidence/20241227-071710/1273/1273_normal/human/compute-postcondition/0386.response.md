The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `cur`. Since `q` initially contains `top`, after removing `top`, `cur` will be equal to `top`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with `-1`, `dep[top]` is 0, `q` is a deque containing elements except `top`, `cur` is equal to `top`**
