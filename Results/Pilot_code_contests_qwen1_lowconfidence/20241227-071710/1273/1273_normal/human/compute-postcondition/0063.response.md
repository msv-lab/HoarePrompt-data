The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. Based on the initial state, `dep[cur]` is either -1 or updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. Therefore, after executing this line of code:

- If `dep[cur]` was -1 initially, then `dep[to]` will be `-1 + 1 = 0`.
- If `dep[cur]` was already updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, then `dep[to]` will be `(dep[cur] + 1) + 1 = dep[cur] + 2`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `dep[cur]` from the initial state, we'll consider both cases. However, we can summarize the changes as follows:

- `q` remains unchanged.
- `cur` remains unchanged.
- `to` remains unchanged.
- `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`q` contains the next leftmost element, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`, `to` is the next neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
