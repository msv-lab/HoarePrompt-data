Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - `to`: This variable iterates over the elements in the list `e[cur]`.
   - `cur`: This is the current node (leftmost element of `q` before `popleft()`).
   - `q`: This is a queue where `cur` is the leftmost element.
   - `dep`: This is a dictionary representing the depth of each node.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `e[cur]`, which means it processes each neighbor `to` of the current node `cur`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `q` now contains the leftmost element and `to`.
   - `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` before `popleft()`.
   - If `dep[to] == -1`, then `dep[cur]` is updated to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dep[cur]`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - After processing the current node `cur`, `cur` will be removed from `q` using `popleft()`.
   - The next node to process will be the new leftmost element in `q`, which we'll call `new_cur`.
   - The loop will then process the neighbors of `new_cur` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `q` will now contain the next leftmost element, which we call `new_cur`.
   - `cur` will be updated to `new_cur`.
   - `to` will be the first neighbor of `new_cur` processed in the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `q` now contains the next leftmost element (`new_cur`).
- `cur` is updated to `new_cur`.
- `to` is the first neighbor of `new_cur`.

Since the exact value of `new_cur` isn't specified, we can represent it generally as follows:

**State: **`q` now contains the next leftmost element, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`, and `to` is the first neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`.**
