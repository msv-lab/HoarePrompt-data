The given code `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` impacts the `deg` and `e` lists. Specifically, it updates the value of `deg` at the index `dep[i]` to be the length of the list `e[i]`. However, the initial values of `dep` and `e` are not provided. Since the exact values are not specified, we cannot determine the exact updated value for `deg`. We only know that at the index `dep[i]`, the value of `deg` is set to the length of the list at the same index in `e`.

Output State: **`deg` is updated such that `deg[dep[i]]` is set to `len(e[i])`, `dep` and `e` remain unchanged.**
