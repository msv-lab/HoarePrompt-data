The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state of `q` includes the original elements plus the new element `to`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` remains unchanged except for `dep[top]` which is now `dep[top] + 1`, `q` is a list with its last element being `to`, `cur` is equal to `top`, `e[top]` must contain at least one element**
