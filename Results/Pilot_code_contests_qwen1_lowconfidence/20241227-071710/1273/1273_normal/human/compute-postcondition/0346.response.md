The code `top = to` assigns the value of `to` to the variable `top`. This changes the value of `top` but does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 3`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`, `to` becomes the next element in `e[cur]`, `q` is either `[to]` or cleared, `dep[center]` is 0, `dep[to]` is determined based on the value of `dep[cur]`, and `top` is equal to `to`.**
