The code updates the `pred` list such that `pred[to]` is set to `end`. No other variables are affected. The previous state of `pred` was that `pred[i]` was the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, and specifically `dep[to]` was equal to `dep[end] + 1`.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i` with `dep[to]` updated to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree and now `pred[to] = end`, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`.**
