Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State Before the Loop
- `q` is a deque containing `[1]`.
- `cur` is 1.
- `end` is 1.
- `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0.
- `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0.

### Condition of the `while` Loop
The loop continues as long as `q` is non-empty, i.e., `while q:`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial State**: 
   - The queue `q` contains `[1]`.
   - The variable `cur` is set to 1, indicating the current node being processed.
   - The variable `end` is set to 1, possibly indicating the target node.
   - The `dep` list has `dep[1]` set to 0 and all other elements set to -1, indicating that node 1 has been discovered and no other nodes have been discovered yet.
   - The `pred` list is initialized to all zeros, indicating no parent relationships have been established yet.

2. **Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `q` must be non-empty.
   - In the given state, `q` is `[1]`, which is non-empty.

Since the condition `q` is already true (i.e., non-empty), no changes are required to the state to ensure the loop executes at least once.

### Final Answer
State: **`q` is deque([1]), `cur` is 1, `end` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0; `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0**.
