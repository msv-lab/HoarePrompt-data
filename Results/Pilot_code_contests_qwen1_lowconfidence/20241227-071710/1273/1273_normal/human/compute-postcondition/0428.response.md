Let's break down the given information and the loop statement step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur` is no longer defined.
   - `q` is the original `q` without its first element plus `to`.
   - `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.
   - `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for to in e[cur]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `to` in the list `e[cur]`.
   - For each iteration, the value of `to` changes to the next element in the list `e[cur]`.
   - The states need to be updated based on the current iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `cur` is no longer defined, it implies that `cur` was used in the context of the previous iteration, but now it needs to be redefined or inferred from the context of the loop.
   - `q` is updated by removing its first element and adding `to`.
   - `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, as it was set in the previous iteration.
   - `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` for the current iteration.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `cur` needs to be redefined as the current node being processed.
   - `q` is updated to include `to` after removing its first element.
   - `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.
   - `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`cur` is the next node in `e[cur]`, `q` is the original `q` without its first element plus `to`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`**.
