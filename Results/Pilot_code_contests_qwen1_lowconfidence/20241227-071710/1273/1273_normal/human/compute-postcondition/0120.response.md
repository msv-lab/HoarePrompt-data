The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[end] + 1`. This means that the distance (`dep`) to the node `to` is set to one more than the distance to the node `end`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `cur` is 0, `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `pred` has updated values for the newly processed `to`, and `q` has the updated state with `to` appended to it on the right side.**
