The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. According to the initial state, `q` is a deque containing `next_to`, `cur` is 0, `end` is `next_to`, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0 and `dep[to]` which is 1, `dep[next_to]` is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[next_to]` which is 1.

After executing `q.append(to)`, the value of `q` will be updated to include `to` in addition to `next_to`.

Output State: **`q` is a deque containing `next_to` and `to`, `cur` is 0, `end` is `next_to`, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0 and `dep[to]` which is 1, `dep[next_to]` is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[next_to]` which is 1 and `pred[to]` is `next_to`.**
