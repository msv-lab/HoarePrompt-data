Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree and determines if the input forms a valid tree structure. Specifically, it checks if the tree is well-formed and if there is a unique central node (or two in case of a tree with even diameter). If the tree is valid, it prints the central node; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

1. The function reads the number of vertices \(n\) and the edges of the tree.
2. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
3. It computes the shortest distance from a root node (node 1) to all other nodes using a breadth-first search (BFS).
4. It checks if all nodes are reachable from the root node.
5. If not all nodes are reachable, it prints `-1`.
6. It identifies the farthest node from the root node and performs another BFS from this node to find the central node.
7. It ensures the central node has a degree of 2 (for single central node) or 1 (for two central nodes in case of even diameter).
8. If the tree passes all checks, it prints the central node; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes the input always forms a valid tree structure (i.e., no cycles and exactly \(n-1\) edges).
- There is no explicit check for the tree being acyclic, though the BFS traversal implicitly verifies this.
- The function does not handle the case where the tree has multiple central nodes due to an even diameter explicitly, although the code attempts to identify the farthest node and then checks its neighbors.
- The function does not validate the input types or ranges explicitly, assuming the input is correctly formatted.

In summary, the function aims to validate a tree structure and find its central node but may not cover all edge cases fully, particularly those involving trees with even diameters.**
