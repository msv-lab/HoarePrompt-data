The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` increments the value of `dep[to]` by 1, where `dep[cur]` is equal to `dep[cur_new]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`e[cur_new]` is non-empty, `q` contains at least four nodes, `dep[to_new]` is equal to `dep[cur_new] + 1`, `dep[cur_new]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur_new] + 1`.**
