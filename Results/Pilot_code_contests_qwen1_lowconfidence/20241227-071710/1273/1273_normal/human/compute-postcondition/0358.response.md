The code updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `deg[dep[i]]` equals -1

After executing the line `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])`, the value of `deg[dep[i]]` changes to `len(e[i])`. Since `i` is 1, `dep[i]` would be `dep[1]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `deg[dep[1]]` is `len(e[1])`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `deg[dep[1]]` equals `len(e[1])`**
