According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the deque `q`. If `q` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` has its leftmost element being the node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1, and `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal. Since `q` is not empty (it still contains elements), the loop condition is satisfied.

However, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can proceed to the next iteration correctly. Specifically, we need to:

1. Ensure that `q` still contains elements after the removal of `end`.
2. Adjust the states related to `end`, `cur`, `dep`, and `pred` to reflect the state just before the next iteration starts.

Since the loop removes the leftmost element (`end`) from `q` and processes it, we need to ensure that the deque `q` is not empty for the next iteration. This means that `q` must still contain at least one element after the removal of `end`.

Here's the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being a node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1, `end` is the node removed from `q` during the current iteration, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, and `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, and `q` must still contain at least one element after the removal of `end`**.
