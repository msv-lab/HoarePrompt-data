The code `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` impacts the `deg` dictionary and the list `e`. However, the initial values and types of `i`, `n`, `dep`, and `e` are not explicitly provided. We know that `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Let's assume `dep` and `e` are defined somewhere in the context.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2

The code will execute as follows:
- `dep[i]` will be `dep[3]`.
- `len(e[i])` will be `len(e[3])`.

Since `i` is 3, `dep[3]` will be used as the key in the dictionary `deg`, and `len(e[3])` will be the value assigned to this key.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `deg[dep[3]]` is `len(e[3])`**
