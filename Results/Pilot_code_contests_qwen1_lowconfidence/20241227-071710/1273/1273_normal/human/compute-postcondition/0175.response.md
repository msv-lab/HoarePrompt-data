The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. Based on the initial state, `q` was a deque containing one less element than before (the leftmost element has been popped), and `cur` was the value of the leftmost element in `q`. After executing this line of code, `to` is appended to `q`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated state:

- `total` is not relevant here.
- `i` is the number of times the loop has executed.
- `dep` is initialized to `[-1] * (n + 1)` with `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `bad` is `False`.
- `q` is a deque containing one less element than before plus the new element `to` (i.e., `q` now contains the leftmost element that was previously popped and the new element `to`).
- `cur` is now the value of the leftmost element in `q`.
- `end` is the last visited node with `dep[end]` being `0`.
- `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree.
- `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor.
- `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` indicating that the node `to` has been visited and its depth is one more than the depth of its predecessor `cur`.

Output State: **`total` is not relevant here, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `dep` is initialized to `[-1] * (n + 1)` with `dep[to]` updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `False`, `q` is a deque containing one less element than before plus the new element `to`, `cur` is now the value of the leftmost element in `q`, `end` is the last visited node with `dep[end]` being `0`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` indicating that the node `to` has been visited and its depth is one more than the depth of its predecessor `cur`.**
