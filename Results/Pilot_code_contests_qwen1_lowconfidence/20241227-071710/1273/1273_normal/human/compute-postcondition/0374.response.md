The `break` statement is executed, which does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `i`, `n`, and `bad` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
