The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the right end of the deque `q`. The other variables (`end`, `cur`, `dep`, `pred`, and `pred[to]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `q` changes, but `end` remains the leftmost element of `q` before the removal.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its rightmost element updated to `to`, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, `cur` is 0, `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update, `pred[to]` is equal to `end`.**
