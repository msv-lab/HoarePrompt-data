The code assigns the value of `end` to `center`. The value of `end` is the last visited node, and it does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the assignment of `center`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `False`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `0`, `end` is the last visited node, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, `center` is the last visited node.**
