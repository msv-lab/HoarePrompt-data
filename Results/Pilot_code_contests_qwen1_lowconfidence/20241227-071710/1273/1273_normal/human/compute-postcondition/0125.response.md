The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be one more than the value of `dep[end]`. Given the initial state where `dep[to]` is initially `-1`, it will now be updated to `dep[end] + 1`.

Since `dep[end]` is not specified to have a specific value, we keep it as `dep[end]` in the output state.

The output state is:
Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`**.
