The `break` statement does not modify any variable's value but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the execution stops there. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 3`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`, `to` becomes the next element in `e[cur]`, `q` is an empty list, `dep[center]` is 0, `dep[to]` is determined based on the value of `dep[cur]`, and `top` is equal to `to`. We break out of the nearest loop or if statement.**
