The code initializes the list `dep` with `-1` for each index from `1` to `n + 1`. This means that every element in the `dep` list is set to `-1`.

- The variable `i` is initialized as `n + 1`.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer.
- The variable `bad` remains `False`.
- The values of `deg[dep[i]]` remain unchanged since `dep[i]` is now `-1`, and they are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated).
- The variable `top` remains `center`.
- The function `print()` outputs `None`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is `center`, `print()` outputs `None`**
