Let's analyze the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Loop
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial States
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `bad` is `False`
- `center` is unchanged
- `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`
- `q` is an empty deque
- `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`

### Analysis

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n + 1`. Since `i` is initially set to `n + 1`, this means that `i` is not within the range specified in the loop (1 to `n + 1`). Therefore, the loop will not execute.

2. **Variable `n`**: `n` is a positive integer, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly. We already know that `n` is a positive integer from the problem statement.

3. **Variable `bad`**: This variable being `False` or `True` does not affect the loop's execution based on the provided information.

4. **Variable `center`**: Since `center` is mentioned as "unchanged," we don't need to adjust its value for the loop to execute.

5. **Variable `dep`**: This list contains shortest distances from `top` to other nodes, and its structure is fine since it is of length `n + 1`.

6. **Variable `q`**: `q` is an empty deque, and this is acceptable for the loop to execute.

7. **Variable `deg`**: `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`. This is fine for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `i` to start from 1 instead of `n + 1`. Specifically, we need to set `i` to 1 before entering the loop.

### Final State
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is False, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` is an empty deque, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`**
