`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. The variable `to` is not mentioned in the initial state, but it is used in the code to assign a new value. The value of `cur` is updated to the next element in `q`, but `q` itself is not defined in the initial state, so its exact nature remains unknown. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but its exact value after incrementation is not specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to the next element in `q`, and `dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is updated to the next element in `q`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
