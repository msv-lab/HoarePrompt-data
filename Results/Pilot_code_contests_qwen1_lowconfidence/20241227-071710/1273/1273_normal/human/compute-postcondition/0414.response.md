`q` appends `to` to its list. The value of `dep[to_new]` remains equal to `dep[cur_new] + 1`, and the value of `dep[cur_new]` remains unchanged. The value of `dep[to]` also remains equal to `dep[cur_new] + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `e[cur_new]` is non-empty, `q` contains at least four nodes plus `to`, `dep[to_new]` is equal to `dep[cur_new] + 1`, `dep[cur_new]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur_new] + 1`.

Output State: **`e[cur_new]` is non-empty, `q` contains at least four nodes plus `to`, `dep[to_new]` is equal to `dep[cur_new] + 1`, `dep[cur_new]` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur_new] + 1.`**
