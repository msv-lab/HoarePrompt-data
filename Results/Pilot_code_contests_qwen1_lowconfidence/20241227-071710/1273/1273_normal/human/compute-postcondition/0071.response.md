`q` is assigned the value `deque([cur])`. Since `cur` is 1, `q` becomes `deque([1])`. The other variables (`dep` and `pred`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`q` is deque([1]), `cur` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0; `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0.**
