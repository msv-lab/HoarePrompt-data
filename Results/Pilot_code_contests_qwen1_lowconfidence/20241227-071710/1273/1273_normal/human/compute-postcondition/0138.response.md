`bad` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `deg`, and `e`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `bad`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, and the degree of the dependency at index `i` in the `deg` list is not equal to -1, and the current value of `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`; `bad` is True**
