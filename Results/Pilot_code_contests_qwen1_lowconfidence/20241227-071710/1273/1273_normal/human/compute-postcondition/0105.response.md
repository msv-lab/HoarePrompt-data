Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `q` is a deque.
   - `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over each neighbor `to` of `end` using `e[end]`.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - If `dep[to] == -1`, then the rightmost element of `q` is updated to `to` and `pred[to]` is set to `end`.
   - If `dep[to] != -1`, the state remains unchanged.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The leftmost element of `q` was `end`.
   - `cur` is still 0 (since it is not mentioned that it changes).
   - `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update.
   - If `dep[to] == -1`, the rightmost element of `q` is updated to `to` and `pred[to]` is set to `end`.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more neighbor of `end` to iterate over.
   - If the condition `dep[to] == -1` is met for some `to`, then the rightmost element of `q` would be updated, and `pred[to]` would be set to `end`.
   - However, since we don't know the exact value of `to` or the contents of `dep` and `pred`, we need to consider the general case where the loop can continue.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to change is the leftmost element of `q` if `dep[to] == -1` for some `to`.
   - `cur` remains 0.
   - `dep` and `pred` remain unchanged unless updated by the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
- `q` has its leftmost element updated if `dep[to] == -1` for some `to`.
- `cur` is still 0.
- `dep` and `pred` remain unchanged.

State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated, `cur` is 0, `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update**.
