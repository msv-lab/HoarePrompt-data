The variable `top` is assigned the value of `to`. The value of `to` is such that `dep[to] == -1`, but the exact value of `to` is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which is `1`, `q` contains `[to]`, `cur` is `center`, `to` is the next index in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to] == -1`, `top` is `to`.**
