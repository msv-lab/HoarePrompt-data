Output State: **`cur` is no longer defined, `q` is the original `q` without its first element plus all nodes that were processed during the execution of the loop, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` for all `to` in `e[cur]` that were not previously visited (i.e., `dep[to]` was initially -1), and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `cur` is the first element of `q`, and `q` is updated by removing `cur` and adding `to` for all `to` in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to]` was initially -1.
- As the loop continues, `cur` becomes the next node in `e[cur]` that has not yet been visited, and this process repeats.
- Eventually, the loop will process all nodes that are reachable from the initial `cur` and update their `dep` values accordingly.
- When the loop finishes, `cur` is no longer defined because there are no more unvisited nodes in `e[cur]` to process.
- `q` contains all nodes that were added to it during the execution of the loop.
- `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` only for those `to` in `e[cur]` that were initially marked as unvisited (`dep[to] == -1`).
- `dep[cur]` remains unchanged throughout the loop since it is not modified inside the loop.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., the initial `dep[to]` values do not allow any node to be added to `q`), then `cur` remains undefined, `q` remains the same as the initial `q`, and `dep[to]` remains unchanged for all `to` in `e[cur]`.
