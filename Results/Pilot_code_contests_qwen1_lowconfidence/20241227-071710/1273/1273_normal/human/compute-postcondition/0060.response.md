`q` appends the value of `to` to its list. The value of `to` is the first neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`. The values of `cur` and `dep[to]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` now contains the next leftmost element and the value of `to`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`, and `to` is the first neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`; `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`q` now contains the next leftmost element and the value of `to`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`, and `to` is the first neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`; `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`**
