Postcondition: ***`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being a node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i` and now `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` if `dep[to]` was -1, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree and now `pred[to] = end` if `dep[to]` was -1, and `q` has `to` appended to it on the right side, `e[end]` is not an empty list.***
