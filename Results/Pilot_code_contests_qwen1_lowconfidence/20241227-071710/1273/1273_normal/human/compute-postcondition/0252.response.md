`cur` is assigned the value of `q.popleft()`, which means `cur` is the first element in the deque `q`. Initially, `q` contains only the element `center`. After `popleft`, `cur` becomes `center`, and `q` becomes an empty deque. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is `center`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `center`**
