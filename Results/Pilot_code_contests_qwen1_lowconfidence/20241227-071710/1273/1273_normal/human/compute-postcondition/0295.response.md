The code `q.clear()` clears the queue `q`. This means all elements in `q` are removed. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is `to`, `q` is empty, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `to` is the last node that was processed within the loop, `dep[to]` equals -1, `len(e[to])` is not equal to 2, and the length of `e[to]` is 1**
