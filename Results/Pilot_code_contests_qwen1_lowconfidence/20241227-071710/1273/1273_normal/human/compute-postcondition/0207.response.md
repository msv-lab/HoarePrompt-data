`q` appends the value of `to` to itself. The value of `to` is not explicitly given, but it is known that `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables (`cur`, `dep`, `q`, `end`, and `e[cur]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is the queue with `to` appended to it, `end` is the last visited node, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1**
