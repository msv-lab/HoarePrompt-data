The code `q.append(to)` appends the variable `to` to the deque `q`. The value of `to` is `dep[to] - 1`, which was previously set to `dep[end] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

- `q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed.
- `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal.
- `cur` is 0.
- `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i` with `dep[to]` updated to `dep[end] + 1`.
- `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree and now `pred[to] = end`.
- `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1`.

After executing `q.append(to)`:

- `q` now contains the elements of the original deque plus the new element `to`.
- `end` remains the leftmost element of `q` before the removal.
- `cur` remains 0.
- `dep` and `pred` lists remain unchanged except that `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1` and `pred[to] = end`.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed and now includes `to`, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i` with `dep[to]` equal to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree and `pred[to] = end`, and `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[end] + 1**.
