Let's analyze the given state and the loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cur` is a valid node in the graph with at least one neighbor.
- If `dep[to]` equals `-1`, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` and `to` is added to the list `q` as its last element.
- No changes occur if there is no else part.

### For Loop:
```python
for to in e[cur]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each neighbor (`to`) of the current node (`cur`).
2. **Update Logic**: Inside the loop, if `dep[to]` is `-1`, it updates `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1` and adds `to` to the list `q`.

### Current State:
- `cur` is a valid node in the graph with at least one neighbor.
- The loop has processed some neighbors, updating their `dep` values and adding them to the list `q` as necessary.

### Next Iteration:
- To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to identify the next `to` value from the neighbors of `cur`.
- Since `e[cur]` is a list of neighbors, let's assume the current iteration was processing the first neighbor (or the last processed neighbor).

### Updated State:
- After the current iteration, `cur` remains the same (as it is the starting point for the loop).
- The next `to` will be the next neighbor in the list `e[cur]`.

### Conclusion:
State at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `cur` is a valid node in the graph with at least one neighbor.
- `to` is the next neighbor in the list `e[cur]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cur` is a valid node in the graph with at least one neighbor, `to` is the next neighbor in the list `e[cur]`**
