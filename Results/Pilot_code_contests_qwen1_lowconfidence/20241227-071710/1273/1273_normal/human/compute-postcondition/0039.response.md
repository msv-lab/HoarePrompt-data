The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. Based on the initial state, `dep[cur]` is known and `dep[to]` was initially equal to -1. After executing the code, `dep[to]` will be updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex, `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1` and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.**
