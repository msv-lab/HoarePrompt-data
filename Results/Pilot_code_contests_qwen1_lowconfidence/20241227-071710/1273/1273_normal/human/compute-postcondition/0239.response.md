The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead exits the loop or the most nested block it is in. Since there is no loop or nested block in the given code snippet, the only thing that happens is that the execution exits this small segment of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `bad` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `bad` is True**
