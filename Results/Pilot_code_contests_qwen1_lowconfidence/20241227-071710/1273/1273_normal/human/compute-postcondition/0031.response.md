The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `dep[to_next]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `q` contains the new `to_next` value. After executing the line of code, the value of `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `q` contains the new `to_next` value.**
