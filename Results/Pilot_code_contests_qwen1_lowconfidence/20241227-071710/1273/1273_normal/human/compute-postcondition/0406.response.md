`q` is a list that contains at least two nodes. The code appends `to` to `q`. The value of `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `e[cur]` is non-empty. After appending `to` to `q`, the length of `q` is increased by one.

Output State: **`e[cur]` is non-empty, `q` contains at least three nodes, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
