The code `q.clear()` clears the list `q`. Given the initial state, `q` contains either `[to, to]` if `len(e[to]) == 2` or remains as specified. Regardless of its exact content, after executing `q.clear()`, the list `q` will be empty.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which is `2` if `len(e[to]) == 2` or `1` otherwise, `cur` is `center`, `q` is an empty list, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `top` is `to`.**
