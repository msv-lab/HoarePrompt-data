To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is an empty deque.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `end` is the last visited node.
   - `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`.
   - `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree.
   - `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is `-1`.
   - `bad` is `False`.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to \( n + 1 \).
   - This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - The value of `i` starts from 1 and goes up to \( n + 1 \). Therefore, the loop will execute if `n + 1` is at least 1 (which it is, since `n` is a non-negative integer).

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and ends when `i` reaches \( n + 1 \), the initial value of `i` needs to be set to 1.
   - The variable `n` itself does not need adjustment because the loop condition is based on the range of `i` rather than `n`.

5. **Final State**:
   - All other variables (`q`, `cur`, `end`, `dep`, `pred`, `deg`, and `bad`) are already in their initial or appropriate states for the loop to proceed correctly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1**
