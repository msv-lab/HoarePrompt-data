Postcondition: ***`q` is a deque, `cur` is 0, `end` is `next_to`, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0, and `dep[to]` is 1 if `pred[to]` is updated, otherwise it remains -1. `dep[next_to]` is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[next_to]` which is 1 and `pred[to]` is `next_to` if `pred[to]` is updated, otherwise it remains 0. If `dep[to]` is updated to 1, `pred[to]` is updated to `next_to`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
