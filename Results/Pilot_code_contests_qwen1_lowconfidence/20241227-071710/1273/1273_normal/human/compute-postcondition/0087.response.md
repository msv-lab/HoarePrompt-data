The code `dep[to] = dep[end] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]`. Given the initial state, `end` is `next_to`, and `dep[end]` is `dep[next_to]`, which is `0`.

So, after executing the line of code, `dep[to]` will be updated to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`q` is a deque containing either `next_to` and `to` or just `next_to`, `cur` is 0, `end` is `next_to`, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0, `dep[to]` is 1, `dep[next_to]` is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[next_to]` which is 1 and `pred[to]` is `next_to`, `to` is the next element in `e[next_to]`**
