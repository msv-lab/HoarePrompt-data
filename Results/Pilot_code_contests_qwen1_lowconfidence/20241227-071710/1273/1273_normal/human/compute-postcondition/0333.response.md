Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `cur` is the leftmost element of `q` (and `q` has the leftmost element removed), `to` is defined, `q` may be empty depending on the condition, `dep[center]` is 0, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `dep[to]` is 1 if the length of `e[to]` is 2, otherwise `dep[to]` is -1. Additionally, if the length of `e[to]` is 1, `top` is `to` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.***
