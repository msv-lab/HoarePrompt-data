Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which is `1`.
   - `q` contains `[to]`.
   - `cur` is `center`.
   - `to` is the next index in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to] == -1`.

2. Code Execution:
   - The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]`. Since `cur` is `center` and `to` is the next index in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to] == -1`, the value of `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`.
   - Given that `dep[cur]` (which is `center`) is `0`, the new value of `dep[to]` will be `0 + 1`, i.e., `1`.

3. Updated Values:
   - `dep[to]` changes from `1` to `1 + 1 = 2`.

Output State: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0`, `dep[to]` which is now `2`, `q` contains `[to]`, `cur` is `center`, `to` is the next index in `e[cur]` such that `dep[to] == -1`.**
