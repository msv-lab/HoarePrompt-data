`bad` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is True, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` is an empty deque, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`, `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `-1`, and the current value of `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`**
