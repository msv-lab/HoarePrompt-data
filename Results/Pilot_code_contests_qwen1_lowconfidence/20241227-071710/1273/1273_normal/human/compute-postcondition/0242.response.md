To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       if deg[dep[i]] == -1:
           deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])
       elif deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i]):
           bad = True
           break
   ```

2. **Initial State**:
   - `cur` is `None`
   - `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree
   - `q` is an empty deque
   - `end` is the last visited node
   - `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree
   - `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is `-1`
   - `bad` is `False`

3. **Output States for the First Few Iterations**:
   - After 1 iteration: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1. If `deg[dep[1]]` is `-1`, no change is made. Otherwise, if `deg[dep[1]]` is not equal to `len(e[1])`, `bad` is set to `True`.
   - After 2 iterations: `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. If `deg[dep[2]]` equals `len(e[2])`, no change is made to `bad`. Otherwise, `bad` is set to `True`.
   - After 3 iterations: `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2. If `deg[dep[3]]` equals `len(e[3])`, no change is made to `bad`. Otherwise, `bad` is set to `True`.

4. **General Pattern**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `deg[dep[i]]` is `-1`. If so, it sets `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`.
   - If `deg[dep[i]]` is not `-1` and does not equal `len(e[i])`, it sets `bad` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Final Values After All Iterations**:
   - The loop will execute up to `n` times.
   - If the condition `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])` holds for any `i`, `bad` will be set to `True`.
   - If no such `i` exists, `bad` remains `False`.
   - The values of `deg[dep[i]]` will be updated according to the condition in the loop.

### Conclusion

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is:

- `i` is `n + 1` (or the number of iterations actually performed, which is at most `n`).
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `bad` is `True` if there exists any `i` such that `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`. Otherwise, `bad` is `False`.
- The values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated).

### Final Output State

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `True` if there exists any `i` such that `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`, otherwise `bad` is `False`. The values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated).**
