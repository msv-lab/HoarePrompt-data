`dep[to]` is assigned the value `dep[cur] + 1`. The value of `dep[cur]` is known, but the specific value is not given. After executing the code, the value of `dep[to]` is updated to be one more than the value of `dep[cur]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is a valid node that exists in the graph and has at least one neighbor, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
