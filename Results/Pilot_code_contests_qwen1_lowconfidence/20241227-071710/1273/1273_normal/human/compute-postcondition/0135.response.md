The code updates the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to `len(e[i])`. Since `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1, and the initial value of `deg[dep[i]]` is -1, the value of `deg[dep[i]]` will be set to `len(e[1])`.

Therefore, the updated state will be:
- `i` is 1 (unchanged)
- `n` is at least 1 (unchanged)
- `deg[dep[i]]` is now `len(e[1])`

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is at least 1; `deg[dep[i]]` is `len(e[1])`**
