The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[cur] + 1`. Given the initial state, this means that `dep[to]` is now set to `dep[cur] + 1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`, `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`**
