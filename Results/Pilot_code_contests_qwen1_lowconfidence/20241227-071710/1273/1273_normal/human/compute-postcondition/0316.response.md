Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, and `to` is the next node in `e[cur]` with `dep[to]` being either 1 or 2. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, then `q` includes the value of `to` and possibly another element, and `top` is the current value of `to` if `len(e[to]) != 1`. If `len(e[to]) == 1`, then `q` is an empty list and `top` is equal to `to`.**
