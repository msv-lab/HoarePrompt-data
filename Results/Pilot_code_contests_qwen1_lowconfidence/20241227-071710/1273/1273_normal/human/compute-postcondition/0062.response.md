Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `q` contains the next leftmost element.
   - `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`.
   - `to` is the first neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`.
   - If `dep[to]` was initially -1, it is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over all neighbors of `cur` from the list `e[cur]`.
   - For each neighbor `to`, the loop body is executed.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, `to` is the first neighbor of `cur` processed.
   - After processing this neighbor, `to` will be the next neighbor of `cur` to be processed in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `q` remains unchanged as it was only used to determine the initial `cur` and `to`.
   - `cur` remains unchanged as it was set based on `q` and the processing of `to`.
   - `to` will now be the next neighbor of `cur` to be processed, so `to` will be updated to the next neighbor in `e[cur]`.
   - `dep[to]` is already updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if necessary.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `q` remains the same as it was not modified during the loop iteration.
   - `cur` remains the same as it was not modified during the loop iteration.
   - `to` is now the next neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`.
   - If `dep[to]` was initially -1, it is still updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Given this analysis, the new states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`q` contains the next leftmost element, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`, `to` is the next neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`, and `dep[to]` is either -1 or updated to `dep[cur] + 1`**.
