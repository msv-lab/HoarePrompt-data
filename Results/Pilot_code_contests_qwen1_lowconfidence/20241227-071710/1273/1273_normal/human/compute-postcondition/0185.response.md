Output State: **`i` is the total number of nodes in the shortest path tree, `cur` is the node that is the last visited node, `dep` is a list where `dep[i]` is the depth of node `i` in the shortest path tree from node 1, `q` is an empty deque, `end` is the last visited node with `dep[end]` being the depth of `end` from node 1, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, and `bad` is `False` if the entire graph is reachable from node 1, otherwise `True`.**
