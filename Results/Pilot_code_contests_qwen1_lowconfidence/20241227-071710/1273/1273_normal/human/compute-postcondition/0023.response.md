The code `dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1` updates the value of `dep[to]` by setting it to the current value of `dep[cur]` plus 1. The precondition states that `dep[to]` is equal to -1, so this value will be updated. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` is unchanged**
