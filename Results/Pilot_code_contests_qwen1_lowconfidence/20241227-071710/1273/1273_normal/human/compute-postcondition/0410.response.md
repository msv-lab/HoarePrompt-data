`q` is a queue that contains at least three nodes. The code appends `to` to `q`. The value of `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `q` having one additional node `to` compared to its previous state, and `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`e[cur]` is non-empty, `q` contains at least four nodes (the original three plus `to`), `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` is unchanged.**
