Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is either `center` or the last node that satisfied the conditions within the loop, `q` is either empty or contains `q` and `dep[cur] + 1` or `top` as defined, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `to` is the last node that was processed within the loop, and `dep[to]` equals `-1`. If `len(e[to])` is 2, then `q` contains `q` and `dep[cur] + 1`. Otherwise, `top` is `to` if `len(e[to])` is 1, and `q` does not include the leftmost element anymore.***
