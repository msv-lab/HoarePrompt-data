Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `center`, `to` is undefined, `dep` is updated such that for each node `to` in `e[cur]` that was visited, `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` if `len(e[to]) == 2` or `1` if `len(e[to]) == 1`, `top` is the deepest node visited during the loop, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False**.
