Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for the lists `e[u]` and `e[v]` which contain the set of all vertices connected to `u` and `v` respectively, where each vertex appears exactly twice (once for each edge connecting it to another vertex).**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times, meaning that `i` ends up being `n - 1`.
- Each iteration of the loop reads two integers `u` and `v` from input and adds `v` to `e[u]` and `u` to `e[v]`.
- After all iterations, every edge in the tree is added to both endpoints' adjacency lists, and each vertex appears exactly twice in its own adjacency list (once for each edge incident to it).

Thus, the final state of the list `e` represents the complete adjacency lists of a tree with `n` vertices, where each edge is represented twice in the adjacency lists of its endpoints.
