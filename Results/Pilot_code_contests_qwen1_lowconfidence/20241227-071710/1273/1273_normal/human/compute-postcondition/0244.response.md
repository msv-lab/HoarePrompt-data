The code `print(end)` does not affect any variables or their values. It simply prints the value of the variable `end`. Since the variable `end` is not mentioned in the initial state or assigned any value within the provided code snippet, the output of the print statement will be `None` (the default value for the `end` parameter in the `print` function).

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `print()` outputs `None`**
