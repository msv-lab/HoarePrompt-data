Postcondition: ***`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which is `1`. If `len(e[to]) == 2`, then `dep[to]` is `2`, `q` contains `[to, to]`, and `cur` is `center`. Otherwise, `dep[to]` remains `1`, `q` is either `[to]` (if `len(e[to]) == 1`) or remains the same as the precondition (if `len(e[to]) > 1`), and `cur` is `center`.***
