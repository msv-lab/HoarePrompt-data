The code appends the value of `to` to the right end of the deque `q`. The values of `cur`, `dep`, and `pred` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated, `cur` is 0, `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update, and `q` now has an additional element `to` at its right end.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated, `cur` is 0, `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update, `q` now has an additional element `to` at its right end.**
