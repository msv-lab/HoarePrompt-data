Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is True, `center` remains unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` is an empty deque, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`. If `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
