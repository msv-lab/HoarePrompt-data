`q.append(to)` adds the value of `to` to the list `q`. Since `q` was previously described as containing the next leftmost element, `cur` being the next leftmost element of `q`, and `to` being the next neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`, after appending `to` to `q`, `q` will now contain the next leftmost element, followed by `to`.

- `q` is now a list containing the next leftmost element, `cur`, and `to`.
- `cur` remains unchanged.
- `to` remains unchanged.
- `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`q` is a list containing the next leftmost element, `cur`, and `to`; `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`; `to` is the next neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`; and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.**
