The code `pred[to] = end` assigns the value of `end` to the variable `pred[to]`. Given that `dep[to]` was previously equal to `dep[end] + 1`, this assignment does not affect the value of `dep[to]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated, `cur` is 0, `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update, `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is `end`**
