Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is True, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` is an empty deque, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`. If `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to the length of `e[i]`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs in the specified variables.***
