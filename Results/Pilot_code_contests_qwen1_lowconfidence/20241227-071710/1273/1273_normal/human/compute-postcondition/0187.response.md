The code `cur = q.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the deque `q` and assigns it to `cur`. This changes the value of `cur` to the node that was previously at the front of the deque `q`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the total number of nodes in the shortest path tree, `cur` is the node that was at the front of the deque `q`, `dep` is a list where `dep[i]` is the depth of node `i` in the shortest path tree from node 1, `q` is a deque with the leftmost element removed, `end` is the last visited node with `dep[end]` being the depth of `end` from node 1, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, and `bad` is `False` if the entire graph is reachable from node 1, otherwise `True`.**
