Output State: **`e[cur]` is non-empty, `q` contains at least `n + 1` nodes, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1` for all `to` in `e[cur]`, and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `bad` remains unchanged.
   - `center` is unchanged.
   - `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`.
   - `q` is a deque that contains all nodes reachable from `top` with the front element removed.
   - `cur` is the node previously at the front of `q`.
   - `e[top]` must be non-empty if the loop executed at least once.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for to in e[cur]:
       if dep[to] == -1:
           dep[to] = dep[cur] + 1
           q.append(to)
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the neighbors of the current node `cur`.
   - For each neighbor `to` of `cur` whose `dep[to]` is `-1`, the shortest path distance from `top` to `to` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `to` is appended to `q`.

4. **Output State Analysis**:
   - The loop will continue until all nodes reachable from `top` have been processed.
   - Since `q` initially contains all nodes reachable from `top` with the front element removed, and the loop processes nodes one by one, `q` will eventually contain all nodes reachable from `top`.
   - The length of `q` will be `n + 1` because `dep` is initialized for `n + 1` nodes.
   - All neighbors of `cur` that were not yet visited (`dep[to] == -1`) will have their distances updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.
   - Once all nodes are processed, `cur` will eventually point to the last node in `q`, and `dep[cur]` will remain unchanged as it is only updated when `dep[to]` is `-1`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `e[cur]` will still be non-empty because the loop continues as long as there are unvisited neighbors.
   - `q` will contain all nodes reachable from `top`, hence having at least `n + 1` nodes.
   - All `dep[to]` values for `to` in `e[cur]` will be equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.
   - `dep[cur]` will remain unchanged because the loop only updates `dep[to]` and appends new nodes to `q`.

Thus, the final output state is as described above.
