Postcondition: ***`deg` is updated such that `deg[dep[i]]` is set to `len(e[i])` if `deg[dep[i]] == -1`. Otherwise, if `deg[dep[i]] != len(e[i])`, `deg` remains unchanged. Either `bad` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop, or `deg` and `bad` remain unchanged since there is no else part.***
