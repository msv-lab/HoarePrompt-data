The code prints `-1`, but it does not assign this value to any variable. The print statement itself does not change the values of existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `bad`, `center`, `dep`, `q`, and `deg` remain unchanged. The variable `top` remains undefined as it was initially.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `center` remains unchanged, `dep` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, `deg` remains unchanged, `top` is undefined (NameError).**
