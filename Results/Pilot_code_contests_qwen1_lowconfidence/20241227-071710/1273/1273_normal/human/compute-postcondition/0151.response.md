The `break` statement does not change the values of variables but rather breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement context provided, the variables remain unchanged after the `break` statement.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, and `bad` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
