The code `cur = q.popleft()` pops the leftmost element from the deque `q` and assigns it to `cur`. This changes the value of `cur` but does not affect the other variables. 

Given the initial state, the only change is to the value of `cur`.

Output State: **`center` is the node that is the farthest from node 1 along the shortest path to `end`, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, `dep` is initialized to `[-1] * (n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `False`, `q` is a deque containing one less element than before (the leftmost element has been popped), `cur` is now the value of the leftmost element in `q`, `end` is the last visited node, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor, `dep[end]` is `0`.**
