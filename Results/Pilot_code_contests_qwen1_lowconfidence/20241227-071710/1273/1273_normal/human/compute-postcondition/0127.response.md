The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the variable `to` to the deque `q`. The initial state is that `q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, and `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is `end`.

After executing the code, `to` is appended to `q`, which means the rightmost element of `q` is now `to`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), its rightmost element is `to`, `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is `end`.**
