The code initializes a new list `deg` with a length of `n + 1` and sets every element to `-1`. This operation does not affect the values of `q`, `cur`, `end`, `dep`, or `pred`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `deg` list.

Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `cur` is 0, `end` is the last visited node, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `dep[i]` represents the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, and `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is `-1`.**
