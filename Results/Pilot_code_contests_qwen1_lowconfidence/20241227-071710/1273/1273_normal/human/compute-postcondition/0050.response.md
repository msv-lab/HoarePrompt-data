Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `cur` is the first vertex originally in `q`, `e[cur]` is a set of all vertices reachable from `cur` and their distances from `cur` are stored in `dep`, where `dep[vertex]` is the shortest distance from `cur` to `vertex`, `dep[vertex]` is -1 if `vertex` is not reachable from `cur`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to iterate as long as there are vertices in `q` that have not yet been visited (i.e., `dep[to] == -1`).
- Each iteration of the loop processes one vertex `to` from `cur`'s adjacency list (`e[cur]`), updates its distance in `dep`, and appends it to `q` if it wasn't previously added.
- Once `q` becomes empty, it means all vertices reachable from the initial vertex `cur` have been processed and their shortest distances from `cur` are stored in `dep`.

When the loop completes:
- `q` will be an empty deque because all vertices reachable from `cur` have been processed.
- `cur` retains its original value as the starting vertex.
- `e[cur]` contains all vertices reachable from `cur`, and `dep[vertex]` contains the shortest distance from `cur` to each reachable vertex.
- If a vertex is not reachable from `cur`, its distance in `dep` remains `-1`.
