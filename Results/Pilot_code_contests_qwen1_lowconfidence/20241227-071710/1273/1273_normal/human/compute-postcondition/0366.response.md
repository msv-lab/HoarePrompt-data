The code `deg[dep[i]] = len(e[i])` modifies the value of `deg[dep[i]]` to be `len(e[i])`. However, the initial values and definitions of `deg`, `dep`, and `e` are not provided. Since the initial state only mentions `i` being 2 and `n` being a positive integer, and does not provide any initial values for `deg`, `dep`, or `e`, we cannot determine the exact values after the operation.

Given the information, the only thing we can confirm is that `i` is now 2 (unchanged), and `n` is a positive integer (unchanged).

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer**
