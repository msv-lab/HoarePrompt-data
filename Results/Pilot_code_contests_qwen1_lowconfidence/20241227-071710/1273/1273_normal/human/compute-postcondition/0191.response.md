The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The variable `cur` remains unchanged, and `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1` as per the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `to` being added to the list `q`.

Output State: **`cur` is a valid node that exists in the graph and has at least one neighbor, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `q` is a list with an additional element `to`.**
