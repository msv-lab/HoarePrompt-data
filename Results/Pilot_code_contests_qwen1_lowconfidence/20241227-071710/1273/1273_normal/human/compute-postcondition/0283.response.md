Postcondition: **`dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `-1` except for `dep[center]` which is `0` and `dep[to]` which changes as follows: if `dep[to]` was `-1` in the precondition, then after the if statement, `dep[to]` is set to `2` if `len(e[to]) == 2` or `1` otherwise. `cur` is either `center` or `top`, and `q` is either `[to, to, to]` or an empty list, depending on the condition of the if statement. `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element.**
