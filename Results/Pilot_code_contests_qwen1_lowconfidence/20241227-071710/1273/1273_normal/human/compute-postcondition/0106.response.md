The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[end] + 1`. The initial state is that `q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated, `cur` is 0, and `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update. The code does not affect the values of `q`, `cur`, `pred`, or `end`. It only changes the value of `dep[to]`.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element possibly updated, `cur` is 0, `dep` and `pred` are as they were before the update, `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`**
