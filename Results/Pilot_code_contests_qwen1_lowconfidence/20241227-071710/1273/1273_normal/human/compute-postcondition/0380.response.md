The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means no further code is executed, and all variables retain their current values. The states of `i`, `n`, `bad`, and `center` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False if there exists any `i` from 1 to `n` where `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, otherwise `bad` is `False`, `center` is unchanged**
