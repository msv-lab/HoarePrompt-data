The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is now `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, `q` contains the new `to` value and `q` is updated with the new value of `to`.**
