To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop logic.

Given:
- `q` is an empty deque.
- `cur` is the first vertex originally in `q`.
- `e[cur]` is a set of all vertices reachable from `cur` and their distances from `cur` are stored in `dep`, where `dep[vertex]` is the shortest distance from `cur` to `vertex`.
- `dep[vertex]` is `-1` if `vertex` is not reachable from `cur`.

The loop condition is:
```python
while q:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must not be empty. Given that `q` is initially empty, we need to adjust the state such that `q` contains at least one element.

Since `q` is initially empty and no elements are added to it during the loop (as no addition operation is mentioned), we need to ensure that there was a way to add elements to `q` during the loop execution. This typically happens when exploring the neighbors of the current vertex (`cur`) and adding them to `q`.

However, since the problem specifies that `q` is empty at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the loop can proceed with a non-empty `q`. This means that some vertices must be reachable from `cur` and added to `q`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex that is reachable from `cur`, and these vertices should be added to `q`.

State: **`q` must contain at least one vertex reachable from `cur`, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one vertex that is reachable from `cur`**
