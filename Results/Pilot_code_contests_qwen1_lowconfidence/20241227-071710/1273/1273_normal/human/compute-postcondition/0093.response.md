The code `end = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `end`. This affects the value of `end` and the structure of `q`.

- The initial state: `q` is a non-empty deque, `cur` is 0, `end` is the last visited node or remains 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, and `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree.
- After executing `end = q.popleft()`, the value of `end` becomes the leftmost element of `q`, which was previously `end` (the last visited node or remains 1). The deque `q` loses its leftmost element.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed.
- `end` is now the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, which was previously `end` (the last visited node or remains 1).

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, which was previously `end` (the last visited node or remains 1), `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, and `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree.**
