Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`.
- If `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` and `q` is updated by appending `to` to the right end.
- Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement
```python
for to in e[cur]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables and Conditions:**
   - `q`: A deque.
   - `e[cur]`: An iterable of vertices connected to `cur`.
   - `to`: Each vertex in `e[cur]`.
   - `dep`: A list where `dep[i]` represents the depth or distance from the starting point (or some root node) to vertex `i`.
   - `cur`: The current vertex being processed.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `to` in `e[cur]`, the loop processes the vertex.
   - If `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, it means `to` has not been visited yet.
     - In this case, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` (indicating that the distance to `to` is one step further from `cur`).
     - `to` is appended to the right end of `q` to add it to the queue for future processing.

3. **State Transition:**
   - If `dep[to]` was not `-1`, the state remains unchanged for `to`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - We need to consider the updated state for the next iteration of the loop.
   - Since we don't know the exact order of vertices in `e[cur]`, we assume that `to` will be the next vertex processed in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `dep[to]` will be updated if it was `-1`, and `q` will be updated by appending `to` to the right end.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration
- `q` will have at least one less vertex plus the value of `to` (the next vertex to process), because `to` will be added to the right end of `q`.
- If `dep[to]` was `-1`, it will now be set to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Final Answer
State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if it was initially `-1`, otherwise the state remains unchanged.**

However, to provide a clear and concise state for the next iteration, we can summarize as:

State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, otherwise the state remains unchanged.**

This reflects the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop.
