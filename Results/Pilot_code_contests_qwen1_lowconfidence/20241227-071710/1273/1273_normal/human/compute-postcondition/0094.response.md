Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Provided:**
   - `q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed.
   - `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, which was previously `end` (the last visited node or remains 1).
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`.
   - `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for to in e[end]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each neighbor (`to`) of the current node (`end`).
   - For the loop to execute, `e[end]` must contain at least one element (i.e., the node `end` must have at least one neighbor).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop depends on the neighbors of `end`, we need to ensure that `end` has at least one neighbor.
   - We don't need to change `cur`, `dep`, or `pred` as they are not directly involved in the loop condition.
   - We need to adjust `q` and `end` to reflect that `end` still represents a valid node with neighbors.

### Final Adjusted State:

- Ensure that `end` is a node that has at least one neighbor in the adjacency list `e[end]`.

Thus, the final state after adjustment should be:

State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed, `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal, which was previously `end` (the last visited node or remains 1), and `end` must have at least one neighbor in the adjacency list `e[end]`, `cur` is 0, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, and `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree.**
