Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` (after it was removed).
   - `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree.
   - `q` is the queue with `to` appended to it.
   - `end` is the last visited node.
   - `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
   - `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to] == -1`.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for to in e[cur]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over all elements in `e[cur]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, which is already given as part of the current state.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - After removing `cur` from `q`, the new value of `cur` will be the next leftmost element of `q`.
   - The new state of `q` will be the queue without the `cur` element and with `to` appended.
   - The variable `end` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.
   - The variable `dep` should reflect the updated shortest path depths as nodes are processed.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `cur` will be the next leftmost element of `q` after `to` is appended.
   - `q` will be the queue with `cur` replaced by the next leftmost element and `to` appended.
   - `dep` will be updated such that `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was previously `-1`.

Given these points, we can summarize the new state as follows:

**State:**
- `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` (after `to` is appended).
- `q` is the queue with `cur` replaced by the next leftmost element and `to` appended.
- `dep` is updated such that `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was previously `-1`.
- `end` remains the same as the previous state.
- `e[cur]` still contains at least one element.

So, the final state is:
State: **`cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` (after `to` is appended), `q` is the queue with `cur` replaced by the next leftmost element and `to` appended, `dep` is updated such that `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was previously `-1`, `end` is the last visited node, and `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.**
