`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. The value of `dep[cur]` is determined based on the initial state, but it does not change because the code only affects `dep[to]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 3`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`, `to` becomes the next element in `e[cur]`, `q` is either `[to]` or cleared, `dep[center]` is 0, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, and `top` is updated if necessary.**
