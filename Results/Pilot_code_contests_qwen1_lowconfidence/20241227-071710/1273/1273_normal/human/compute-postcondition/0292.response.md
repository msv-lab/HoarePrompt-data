Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `dep[center]` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, the values of `deg[dep[i]]` are either `-1` (if not yet updated) or `len(e[i])` (if the condition was not violated), `top` is either `center` or the last node that satisfied the conditions within the loop, `q` does not contain the leftmost element anymore, `cur` is the current leftmost element of `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, `to` is the last node that was processed within the loop, and `dep[to]` equals -1, `len(e[to])` is not equal to 2**
