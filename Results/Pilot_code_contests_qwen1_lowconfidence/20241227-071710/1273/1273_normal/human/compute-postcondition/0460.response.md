The `exit()` function call ends the program immediately without executing any further code. This means that no new assignments or operations are performed, and the current state of the variables is preserved. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `center` is unchanged, `dep` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, `deg` remains unchanged, `top` is undefined (NameError)**
