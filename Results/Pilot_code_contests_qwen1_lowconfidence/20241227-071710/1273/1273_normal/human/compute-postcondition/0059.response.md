The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to be `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that the distance (`dep`) of node `to` is increased by 1 compared to the distance of its neighbor `cur`.

- `q` and `cur` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.
- `to` is the first neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`, and its distance is updated.

Therefore, the Output State is: `q` now contains the next leftmost element, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`, and `to` is the first neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`; `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Output State: **`q` now contains the next leftmost element, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q`, and `to` is the first neighbor of `cur` in the list `e[cur]`; `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`**
