The code initializes a list of lists called `e` with `n + 1` empty lists. This list is used to represent the edges in a tree structure, where each index corresponds to a vertex, and the list at that index contains the adjacent vertices.

- The initial state is that `n` is the integer value of the input, representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- After executing the code, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the input, representing the number of vertices in the tree; `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list.**
