Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `True` if there exists any `i` from 1 to `n` where `deg[dep[i]]` is not equal to `len(e[i])`, otherwise `bad` is `False`.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initially, `i` starts at `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `bad` is `False`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - For each `i`, the condition checks whether `deg[dep[i]]` is `-1`. If it is, `deg[dep[i]]` is set to `len(e[i])`.
   - If `deg[dep[i]]` is not `-1` and does not match `len(e[i])`, then `bad` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `bad` will be `True` if at least one `i` from 1 to `n` has `deg[dep[i]]` not equal to `len(e[i])`.
   - If no such `i` exists, `bad` will remain `False`.

This reasoning ensures that we capture the final state of all variables after the loop has executed, adhering to the conditions specified by the loop logic.
