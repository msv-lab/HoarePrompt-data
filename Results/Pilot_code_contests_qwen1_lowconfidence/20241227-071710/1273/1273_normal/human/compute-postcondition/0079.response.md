The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. This changes the value of `q` but does not affect the other variables.

- `q` was initially a deque containing an empty list (`deque([])`). After appending `to`, `q` will now contain `[to]`.
- `cur` remains 1.
- `end` remains 1.
- `dep` remains a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0.
- `pred` remains a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[to]` which is 1.
- `e[1]` remains unchanged.
- The current value of `dep[to]` remains 0.

Output State: **`q` is deque([to]), `cur` is 1, `end` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0 except `pred[to]` which is 1, `e[1]` contains at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is 0.**
