The code `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the list `q`. The value of `to` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `q` is a list, and this operation adds an element to it.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` remains unchanged, `center` is unchanged, `dep` remains unchanged except for `dep[top]` which is now `dep[top] + 1`, `q` is a list with an additional element `to` appended to it, `cur` is equal to `top`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element**
