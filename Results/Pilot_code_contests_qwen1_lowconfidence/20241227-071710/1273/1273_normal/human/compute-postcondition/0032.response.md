`q` is appended with the value of `to`. The value of `to_next` in `q` is updated to the new `to` value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `q` now contains the original elements plus the new `to` value.

Output State: **`e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `q` contains the original elements plus the new `to` value.**
