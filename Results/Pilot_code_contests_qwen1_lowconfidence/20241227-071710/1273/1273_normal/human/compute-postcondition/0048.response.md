The code snippet `q.append(to)` appends the value of `to` to the deque `q`. The initial state indicates that `q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`, and `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, otherwise the state remains unchanged.

After executing `q.append(to)`, the value of `q` changes to include `to` at the end of the deque. The other conditions and the value of `dep[to]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to` and `to` appended to it; `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, otherwise the state remains unchanged.**
