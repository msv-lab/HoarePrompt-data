Postcondition: ***`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`). `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `cur` is 0. If `dep[to]` was initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is set to `end`, and `to` is appended to `q` on the right side. If `dep[to]` was not `-1`, no changes are made.***
