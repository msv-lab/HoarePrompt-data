The code `center = pred[center]` updates the value of `center` to be the value of `pred[center]`. This means that `center` now holds the predecessor of the original `center` in the shortest path tree. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`center` is `pred[center]`, `i` is 2, `dep[end]` must be at least 4, `n` is a non-negative integer, `bad` is `False`, `q` is an empty deque, `cur` is `0`, `end` is the last visited node, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree, `deg` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where every element is either `-1` (indicating the shortest path has not been determined yet) or the length of the edge leading to node `i` from its predecessor**.
