The code `pred[to] = end` updates the `pred` variable such that the value of `pred[to]` is set to `end`. Based on the initial state, the value of `to` is determined by the condition that the leftmost element of `q` (which is the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1) is the next node after `end` was removed from `q`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the updated values are:
- `q` remains unchanged, with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`).
- `end` remains unchanged, representing the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration.
- `dep[to]` remains unchanged, as it is not directly affected by this line of code.
- `pred[to]` is updated to be equal to `end`.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with its leftmost element being the next node with the shortest unexplored distance from node 1 (excluding the node previously in `end`), `end` is the node that was removed from `q` during the current iteration, `dep[to]` is `dep[end] + 1`, `pred[to]` is `end`**
