`cur` is assigned the value of the first element in the deque `q` using the `popleft()` method, which removes and returns the leftmost element from the deque. After this operation, the deque `q` no longer contains the element that was removed. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex, `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`, and the remaining variables are unchanged.**
