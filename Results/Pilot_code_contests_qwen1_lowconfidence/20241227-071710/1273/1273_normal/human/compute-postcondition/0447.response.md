`bad` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `i` remains 2, `n` remains a positive integer, `center` remains unchanged, `dep` remains a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` remains an empty deque, and `deg` remains a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is True, `center` is unchanged, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `dep[to]` is set to the shortest distance from `top` to `to`, `q` is an empty deque, `deg` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to `-1`.**
