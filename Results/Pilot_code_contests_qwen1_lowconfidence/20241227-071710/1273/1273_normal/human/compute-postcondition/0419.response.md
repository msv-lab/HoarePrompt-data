Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state**: The given state before the loop starts includes:
   - `cur` is the first element of `q` after it has been removed.
   - `q` is `q` without its first element.
   - For all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.
   - `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.

2. **Determine what is needed for the loop to execute**: The loop iterates over each `to` in `e[cur]`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to verify that `e[cur]` is not empty (i.e., there are elements in `e[cur]`).

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on `e[cur]` having at least one element, we need to ensure this condition is met.
   - We don't need to change `cur`, `q`, or the values of `dep[cur]` and `dep[to]` since these are already defined and correct for the loop to potentially execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `e[cur]` is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is the first element of `q` after it has been removed, `q` is `q` without its first element, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1` for all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[cur]` remains unchanged, and `e[cur]` must have at least one element**.
