`q` is appended with the value of `to`. The value of `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`, and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` is unchanged, and `q` now contains the element `to`.

Output State: **`e[1]` must contain at least one vertex, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`, `dep[cur]` is unchanged, `q` contains the element `to`.**
