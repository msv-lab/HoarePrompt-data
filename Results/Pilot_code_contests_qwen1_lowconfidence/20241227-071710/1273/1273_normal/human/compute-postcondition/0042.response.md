Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`.
   - `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`.
   - `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.
   - `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `to` in `e[cur]`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `e[cur]` must contain at least one element.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - After the first iteration, `to` is set to the first element of `e[cur]`.
   - `cur` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `q` loses its first element (which is `cur`), but since we know `q` had at least one less vertex plus the value of `to` initially, after removing `cur`, it still contains at least one element (the value of `to`).
   - `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element.
   - Since `to` is set to the first element of `e[cur]`, `e[cur]` should still have at least one element left.

Given this analysis, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `q` remains a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to` because it loses the first element (`cur`), but retains the `to` value.
- `cur` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
- `e[cur]` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
- `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`q` is a deque with at least one less vertex plus the value of `to`, `cur` is the value of the first vertex originally in `q`, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is now equal to `dep[cur] + 1**.
