The code updates the value of `dep[to]` to `dep[end] + 1`. From the initial state, we know `dep[end]` is -1 because `end` is 1 and `dep[1]` is 0. Therefore, `dep[to]` will be `-1 + 1`, which is `0`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`q` is deque([]), `cur` is 1, `end` is 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0, `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0, `e[1]` must contain at least one element, and the current value of `dep[to]` is 0**
