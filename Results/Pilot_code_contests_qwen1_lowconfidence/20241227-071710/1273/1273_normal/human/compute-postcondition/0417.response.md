Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `e[cur]` is non-empty.
- `q` contains at least `n + 1` nodes.
- For all `to` in `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1`.
- `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while q:`. This means the loop continues as long as `q` is not empty.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must not be empty. 
- The current state tells us that `q` contains at least `n + 1` nodes, but we need to ensure that `q` still has at least one node to continue the loop.

### Adjustment Needed:
Since `q` must not be empty for the loop to continue, and it currently contains at least `n + 1` nodes, we only need to ensure that `q` has at least one node. 

However, since the state already indicates that `q` contains at least `n + 1` nodes (which is more than one), no additional adjustment is needed for `q`.

### Additional Considerations:
- The values of `e[cur]`, `dep[cur]`, and `dep[to]` for `to` in `e[cur]` do not affect the loop continuation condition because they do not change the fact that `q` contains nodes.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time based on the given conditions.

### Final State:
State: **`e[cur]` is non-empty, `q` contains at least `n + 1` nodes, `dep[to]` is equal to `dep[cur] + 1` for all `to` in `e[cur]`, and `dep[cur]` remains unchanged.**

The loop will continue to execute as long as `q` is not empty, which it currently is according to the given state.
