`dep[to]` is assigned the value of `dep[cur] + 1`. This means that the depth of node `to` is set to one more than the depth of its neighbor `cur`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cur` is a valid node in the graph with at least one neighbor, `to` is the next neighbor in the list `e[cur]`, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1`**
