Let's analyze the loop step-by-step and determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `q` is a deque([]).
- `cur` is 1.
- `end` is 1.
- `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are -1 except `dep[1]` which is 0.
- `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for to in e[end]:
    if dep[to] == -1:
        dep[to] = dep[end] + 1
        pred[to] = end
        q.append(to)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: Initially, `end` is set to 1, and `q` is empty. The loop iterates over the neighbors of `end` (which is 1 initially). If a neighbor `to` has not been visited (`dep[to] == -1`), it updates `dep[to]` to `dep[1] + 1` and sets `pred[to]` to 1. It also appends `to` to `q`.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - Suppose `e[1]` contains `to`. After the first iteration:
     - `q` becomes deque([`to`]).
     - `cur` becomes 1.
     - `end` remains 1.
     - `dep[to]` is updated to 1.
     - `pred[to]` is updated to 1.

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - Now `end` is `to`. The loop checks the neighbors of `to`.
   - Suppose `e[to]` contains `next_to`. After the second iteration:
     - `q` could be deque([`to`, `next_to`]) or deque([`next_to`]).
     - `cur` becomes 0.
     - `end` becomes `next_to`.
     - `dep[next_to]` is updated to 0.
     - `pred[next_to]` is updated to `to`.
     - `dep[to]` remains 1 if it was updated, otherwise it stays -1.

4. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - This process continues, updating `dep` and `pred` for unvisited nodes and appending them to `q`.
   - Eventually, all reachable nodes from node 1 will be processed, and `q` will be empty when there are no more unvisited nodes.

5. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `q` will be empty.
   - `cur` will be 0.
   - `end` will be the last node visited, or it may remain unchanged depending on the structure of the graph.
   - `dep` will contain the shortest path distances from node 1 to all other nodes.
   - `pred` will contain the predecessors for each node in the shortest path tree.

### Output State:
Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `cur` is 0, `end` is the last visited node or remains 1, `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`, and `pred` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `pred[i]` is the predecessor of node `i` in the shortest path tree.**
