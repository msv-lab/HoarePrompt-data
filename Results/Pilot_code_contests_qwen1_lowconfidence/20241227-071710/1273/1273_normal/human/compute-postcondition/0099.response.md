Postcondition: ***`q` is a deque with its leftmost element removed, and this element is either `to` or remains as the leftmost element of `q` before the removal. `end` is the leftmost element of `q` before the removal. `cur` is 0. `dep` is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where `dep[i]` is the shortest distance from node 1 to node `i`. If `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[end] + 1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[end] + 1` and `pred[to]` is set to `end`. Otherwise, `dep` and `pred` remain unchanged.***
