Output State: **`cur` is a node that has no unvisited neighbors (i.e., all its neighbors have been visited), `dep` is the depth of each node from node 1 in the shortest path tree, `q` is a deque containing all nodes that need further exploration, and `end` is the last visited node.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Initially, `cur` is a valid node in the graph, and `dep` contains the depths of all nodes from node 1 in the shortest path tree, with `-1` indicating nodes that haven't been explored yet. The `q` deque initially contains nodes to be processed, and `end` is the last visited node.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each neighbor `to` of the current node `cur`.
   - If `dep[to]` is `-1`, it means `to` is an unvisited node. In this case, `dep[to]` is updated to `dep[cur] + 1` and `to` is added to the `q` deque.
   - If `dep[to]` is not `-1`, no changes occur, meaning `to` is already visited.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop continues until there are no more unvisited neighbors for the current node `cur`.
   - When the loop finishes, `cur` will be a node that has no unvisited neighbors, meaning all its neighbors have been visited and their depths have been updated in `dep`.

4. **Final Values**:
   - `cur`: This will be a node with no unvisited neighbors, implying that all reachable nodes from the starting node (1) have been processed.
   - `dep`: All nodes in the graph will have their correct depths calculated from node 1.
   - `q`: Will be empty since all nodes have been processed.
   - `end`: Will be the last visited node, which could be any node in the graph if the entire graph is reachable from node 1, or it might be a node that cannot be reached from node 1 if the graph is not fully connected.

This completes the analysis of the loop's output state after all iterations.
