According to the given information, the loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- The loop checks if `deg[dep[1]]` is `-1`, and if not, it further checks if `deg[dep[1]]` is not equal to the length of `e[1]`. If this condition is true, `bad` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
