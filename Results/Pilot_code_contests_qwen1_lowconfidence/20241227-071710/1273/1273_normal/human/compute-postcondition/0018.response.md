The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `cur`. The variable `cur` is initialized to `1`, and no other changes occur to the other variables. Therefore, the value of `cur` is now `1`, while the values of `n`, `i`, `e`, `dep`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `e` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list except for the lists `e[u]` and `e[v]` which contain the set of all vertices connected to `u` and `v` respectively, where each vertex appears exactly twice (once for each edge connecting it to another vertex); `dep[1]` is `0`, `dep` is a list of length `n + 1` with each element initialized to `-1`, `q` is a deque containing `[1]`, `cur` is `1`.**
