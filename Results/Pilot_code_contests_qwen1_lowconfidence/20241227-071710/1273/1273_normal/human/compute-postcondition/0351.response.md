Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 3`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`, `to` becomes the next element in `e[cur]`, `q` is either `[... , to]` or an empty list, `dep[center]` is 0, `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `len(e[to]) == 2`, otherwise it is determined based on the value of `dep[cur]`, and `top` is updated if necessary, and if `len(e[to]) == 1`, the loop or if statement is broken.*** 

Explanation: Since there is no else part provided, the overall postcondition directly incorporates the conditions from the if part. The postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the if condition is evaluated, indicating that if `len(e[to]) == 1`, the loop or if statement is broken.
