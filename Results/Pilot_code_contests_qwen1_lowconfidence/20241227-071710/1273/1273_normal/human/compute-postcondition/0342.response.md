Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `bad` is `False`, `cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` after processing `to`, `to` is defined, `q` is either `[to]` or cleared, `dep[center]` is 0, `e[cur]` must contain at least one element, and `dep[to]` is determined as follows: if `len(e[to]) == 2`, `dep[to]` is 0 if `dep[cur]` was -1, and 1 if `dep[cur]` was 0; otherwise, `dep[to]` is -1, and `top` is `to`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out if necessary.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else cases, noting that the else part does not provide additional conditions, and thus the if case covers all possibilities.
