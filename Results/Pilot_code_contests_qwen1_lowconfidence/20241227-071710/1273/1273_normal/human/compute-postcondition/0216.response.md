Postcondition: ***`cur` is the next leftmost element of `q` (after `to` is appended), `q` is the queue with `cur` replaced by the next leftmost element and `to` appended, `dep` is updated such that `dep[to]` is `dep[cur] + 1` if `dep[to]` was previously `-1`, `end` remains the same as the previous state, and `e[cur]` still contains at least one element. If `dep[to]` is initially `-1`, then `dep[to]` is set to `dep[cur] + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dep[to]`.***
