`node2_nr` is assigned the value of `node1_nr + 2`. The value of `node1_nr` is less than `n`, so `node2_nr` will be `node1_nr + 2`. The state of `m` remains unchanged as it was initially greater than 0 and is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0; `node1_nr` is less than `n`; `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `node1_nr` is less than `n`; `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`**
