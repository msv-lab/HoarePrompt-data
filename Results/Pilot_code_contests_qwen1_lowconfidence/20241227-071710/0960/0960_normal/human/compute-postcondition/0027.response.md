The code `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. The values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` are specified in the initial state as `node2_nr` being `node1_nr + 2`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `node1_new`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of the tuple to the `edges` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `node1_new` must be less than 2, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`, `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node1_nr + 2)`**
