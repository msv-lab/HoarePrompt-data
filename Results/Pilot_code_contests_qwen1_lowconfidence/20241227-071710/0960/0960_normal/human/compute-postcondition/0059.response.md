The `exit()` function call does not change the values of any variables but rather terminates the program. Since no variables are modified within this line of code, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `node1_nr` is `n + (n - 2)`, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`, `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`) up to (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr + m - 1`). The value of `m` is greater than 0**
