`node1_nr` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `v`, and `edges`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of servers; `m` is `m - (n - 1)` representing the adjusted number of direct connections; `v` is an integer representing the index of the failing server; `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, i + 1)` represents a connection between consecutive indices from `0` to `n-2`; `node1_nr` is `1`.
