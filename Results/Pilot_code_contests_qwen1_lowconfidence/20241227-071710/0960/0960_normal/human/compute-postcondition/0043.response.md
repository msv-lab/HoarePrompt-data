The code snippet `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `edges`, `node1_nr`, or `node2_nr`. The only information we can deduce is that `edges` is expected to be a list, and it now contains one more tuple.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing at least the tuple (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`)**
