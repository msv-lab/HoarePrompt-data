Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `edges` is a list containing one additional element, which is the tuple (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr` + 1).
   - `m` is `m - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the while loop must be true.
   - The first condition is `m > 0`.
   - The second condition is `node2_nr < n`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `edges` is updated with a new tuple in each iteration, we don't need to adjust the `edges` state because the new tuple added is already in the list.
   - We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - We also need to ensure that `node2_nr` is less than `n` for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0 and `node2_nr` must be less than `n`**
