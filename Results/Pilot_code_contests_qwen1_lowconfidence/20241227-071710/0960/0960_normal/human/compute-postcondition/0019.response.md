`edges` is a list containing tuples, and the code appends a new tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to this list. The values of `n`, `m`, and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `edges` now includes the new tuple, while `n` and `m` retain their original conditions.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 0, `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` and possibly other tuples, and `node2_nr` is less than `n`.**
