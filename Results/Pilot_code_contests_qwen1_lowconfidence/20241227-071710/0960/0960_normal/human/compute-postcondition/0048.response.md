`m` is decremented by 1, reducing its value by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, `m` is at least 1, `node2_nr` must be less than `n - 1`.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, `m` is at least 1, `node2_nr` must be less than `n - 1**
