Output State: **`m` is 0, `node1_nr` is `n + (n - 2)`, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`, `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`) up to (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr + m - 1`)**

Explanation:
- The loop runs until `m` is 0 or `node1_nr` reaches `n`. Each iteration of the outer loop increments `node1_nr` by 1, and the inner loop appends connections in pairs `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the `edges` list.
- After the first iteration, `node1_nr` is `2` and `node2_nr` is `n - 1`. The first set of edges added is `[(2, n-1)]`.
- After the second iteration, `node1_nr` is `3` and `node2_nr` is `n`. The next set of edges added is `[(3, n-1), (3, n-2)]`.
- This pattern continues until `node1_nr` reaches `n + (n - 2)`, at which point `node2_nr` would be `node1_nr + 2` and the inner loop does not append any more edges since `m` is 0.

Given this, after all iterations, `m` is 0, `node1_nr` is `n + (n - 2)`, and `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`. The `edges` list contains all the tuples added during the iterations.
