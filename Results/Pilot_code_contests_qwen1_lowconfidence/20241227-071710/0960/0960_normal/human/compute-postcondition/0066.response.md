Functionality: **The function `func()` accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of servers; `m`, the number of direct connections; and `v`, the index of the failing server. It first checks if the number of direct connections `m` is less than `n - 1`. If so, it prints `-1` and exits, indicating an invalid configuration. Otherwise, it constructs a list of edges connecting the servers. It then attempts to add additional edges to ensure all servers are connected, except for the failing server indexed by `v`. After ensuring the graph is fully connected (or printing `-1` if it cannot), it swaps the indices of the first and failing servers in the connectivity list. Finally, it prints the connectivity information for each edge, excluding the failing server, in a formatted string. Potential edge cases include invalid ranges for `n`, `m`, and `v`, and the function handles these by printing `-1` and exiting. Missing functionality includes no error handling for non-integer inputs or out-of-range `v` values beyond the initial check.**
