Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is 0, `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` and ending at `(node1_nr, n - 1)`, `node2_nr` is `n - 1`.** 

Explanation:
1. The loop continues to append tuples to the `edges` list as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.
2. Each iteration appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to `edges` and increments `node2_nr` by 1.
3. After the loop finishes, `m` will be 0 because the loop condition `m > 0` is no longer satisfied.
4. `node2_nr` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `node2_nr` until it reaches `n - 1`.
5. Therefore, `edges` will contain tuples starting from `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` up to `(node1_nr, n - 1)`. Given that `node1_nr` is 1, `edges` will have tuples like `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, ..., `(1, n - 1)`.
