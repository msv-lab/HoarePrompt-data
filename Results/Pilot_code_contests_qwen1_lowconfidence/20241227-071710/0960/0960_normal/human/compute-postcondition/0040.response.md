Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is 0
   - `node2_nr` is `n`
   - `edges` is a list containing tuples `(n + 1, n + 3)`, `(n + 1, n + 4)`, ..., `((n + 1) - 1, n - 1)`
   - `node1_nr` is `n + 1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs as long as `m > 0` and `node1_nr < n`.

3. **Analysis of Loop Conditions:**
   - The condition `m > 0` is currently false because `m` is 0.
   - The condition `node1_nr < n` is also false because `node1_nr` is `n + 1` and `n + 1` is not less than `n`.

4. **Modifying States for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 0. Since `m` is currently 0, we need to adjust `m` to be greater than 0.
   - Additionally, `node1_nr` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue. Since `node1_nr` is `n + 1`, we need to adjust `node1_nr` to be less than `n`.

5. **Summary of Adjustments:**
   - We need to set `m` to a value greater than 0.
   - We need to set `node1_nr` to a value less than `n`.

Therefore, the modified states for the next iteration are:
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `node1_nr` is less than `n`**
