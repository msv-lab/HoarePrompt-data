The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 0, and `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`. The `edges` tuple remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated value of `node2_nr` is `node2_nr + 1`. All other variables and their relationships remain as initially stated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 0, and `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`; `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, and `node2_nr` is increased by 1.**
