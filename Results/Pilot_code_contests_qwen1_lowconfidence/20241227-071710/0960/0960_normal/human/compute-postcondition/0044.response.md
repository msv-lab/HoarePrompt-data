`m` is decremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `m`, only that it is a variable. Since no information about the initial value of `m` is given, the only thing we can definitively say is that `m` is now one less than its original value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `edges` is a list containing at least the tuple (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`).**
