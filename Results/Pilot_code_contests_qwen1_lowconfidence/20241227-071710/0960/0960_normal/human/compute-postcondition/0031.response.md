`edges` is a list, and this line of code appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the `edges` list. The values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` are added to the list as a new element. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing one additional element, which is the tuple (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`)**
