The code `node2_nr = node1_nr + 2` assigns the value of `node1_nr + 2` to `node2_nr`. Given that `node1_nr` is initially set to `1`, the value of `node2_nr` will be `1 + 2`, which is `3`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `v`, `edges`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of servers; `m` must be greater than `n - 1`; `v` is an integer representing the index of the failing server; `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, i + 1)` represents a connection between consecutive indices from `0` to `n-2`; `node1_nr` is `1`; `node2_nr` is `3`**
