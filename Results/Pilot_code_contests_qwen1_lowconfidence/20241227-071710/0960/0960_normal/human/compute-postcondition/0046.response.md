To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop and the current state after the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State After Previous Iteration:
- `m` is `m - 1` (decreased by 1 from the previous value)
- `node2_nr` is increased by 1 (from the previous value)
- `edges` is a list containing at least the tuple (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `m > 0`**
   - In the current state, `m` is `m - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure `m - 1` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be at least 2.

2. **Condition 2: `node2_nr < n`**
   - In the current state, `node2_nr` has been increased by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `node2_nr` must still be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure `node2_nr + 1` is less than `n`, which means `node2_nr` must be less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, both conditions need to be satisfied:
  - `m` must be at least 2.
  - `node2_nr` must be less than `n - 1`.

Thus, the final state adjustment needed is:
State: **`m` must be at least 2 and `node2_nr` must be less than `n - 1`**
