The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means that no further operations are performed, and any variables that were in scope before the call to `exit()` will retain their last known values. Since the function does not return a value, the values of `n`, `m`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of servers, `m` is an integer representing the number of direct connections, and `v` is an integer representing the index of the failing server such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ v ≤ n; the actual values of `n`, `m`, and `v` are the integers provided by the input, and the number of direct connections (`m`) is less than the number of servers minus one (`n - 1`)**
