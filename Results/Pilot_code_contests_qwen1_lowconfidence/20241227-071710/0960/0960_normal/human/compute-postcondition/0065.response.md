The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of servers, `m` is an integer representing the number of direct connections, and `v` is an integer representing the index of the failing server such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(0 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and \(1 \leq v \leq n\).

Case_1: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, and `v` is an integer. If `v` is outside the valid range (i.e., less than 1 or greater than `n`), the function returns an error message indicating an invalid server index.

Case_2: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, and `v` is an integer. If `v` is within the valid range (i.e., between 1 and `n` inclusive), the function returns information about the connectivity status of the remaining servers after the server indexed by `v` has failed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `n`, `m`, and `v`, and if `v` is within the valid range, it returns information about the connectivity status of the remaining servers after the server indexed by `v` has failed. If `v` is outside the valid range, it returns an error message indicating an invalid server index.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `v`, where `n` is the number of servers, `m` is the number of direct connections, and `v` is the index of the failing server. If `v` is within the valid range, it returns information about the connectivity status of the remaining servers. If `v` is outside the valid range, it returns an error message indicating an invalid server index.**
