Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.
   - `node2_nr` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop must be true.
   - Currently, `m > 0` is true because `m` is greater than 0.
   - `node2_nr < n` must also be true for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `m > 0` is already true, no adjustment is needed for `m`.
   - To ensure `node2_nr < n` for the next iteration, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs adjustment is `node2_nr` to ensure it remains less than `n`.

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 0, `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, and `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.**
