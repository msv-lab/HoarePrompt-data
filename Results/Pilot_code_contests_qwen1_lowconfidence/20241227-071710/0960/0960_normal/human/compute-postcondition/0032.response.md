`m` is decremented by 1. The initial state shows that `edges` is a list containing one additional element, which is a tuple (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`). However, the given code only affects the variable `m`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing one additional element, which is the tuple (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`); `m` is `m - 1`**
