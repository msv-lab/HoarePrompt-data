`m` is initially set to `m - 1`, meaning `m` is already decremented by 1 before the given code is executed. The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The list `edges` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `m` is `m - 1`; `node2_nr` is increased by 1; `edges` is a list containing at least the tuple (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`).

Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`; `node2_nr` is increased by 1; `edges` is a list containing at least the tuple (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`).**
