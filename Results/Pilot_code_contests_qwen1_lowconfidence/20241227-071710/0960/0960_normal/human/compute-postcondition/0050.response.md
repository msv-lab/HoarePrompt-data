Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

2. **Current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.
   - `m` is at least 1 (meaning `m >= 1`).
   - `node2_nr` is one more than its original value and still less than `n` (i.e., `node2_nr == original_node2_nr + 1` and `node2_nr < n`).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true: `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.
   - Since `m >= 1`, the only condition that needs adjustment is `node2_nr < n`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`. Additionally, since `node2_nr` is one more than its original value, it must be incremented to satisfy the loop condition.

4. **Final state**:
   - `edges` remains unchanged.
   - `m` remains at least 1.
   - `node2_nr` must be incremented by 1 to ensure it is less than `n`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `node2_nr must be incremented by 1 to be less than `n`.

State: **`edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, `m` is at least 1, `node2_nr` must be incremented by 1 to be less than `n`**
