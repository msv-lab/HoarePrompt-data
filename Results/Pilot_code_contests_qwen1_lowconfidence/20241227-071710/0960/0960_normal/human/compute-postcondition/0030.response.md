Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Loop Conditions**: The loop condition is given as `m > 0 and node2_nr < n`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `n` is greater than 3
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - `node1_new` must be less than 2 (though this state is not directly relevant to the loop condition)
   - `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 3`
   - `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node1_nr + 2)`

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     - `m > 0`
     - `node2_nr < n`

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `n` is already stated as greater than 3, no change is needed for `n`.
   - `m` must remain greater than 0.
   - `node2_nr` must be less than `n`. 

Given that `node2_nr` is defined as `node1_nr + 3`, for the loop to continue, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`. This means `node1_nr + 3` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure these conditions hold true for the next iteration.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `node2_nr` (which is `node1_nr + 3`) must be less than `n`.

**State:**
State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`**
