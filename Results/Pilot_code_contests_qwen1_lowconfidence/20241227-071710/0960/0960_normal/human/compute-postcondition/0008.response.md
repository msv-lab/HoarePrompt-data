To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the `while` loop will run:

The loop condition is `m > 0 and node1_nr < n`.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** `m > 0`
   - This means that the adjusted number of direct connections `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

2. **Condition 2:** `node1_nr < n`
   - This means that the index of the failing server `node1_nr` must be less than the total number of servers `n` for the loop to continue.

Given the current state before the loop:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of servers.
- `m` is `m - (n - 1)` representing the adjusted number of direct connections.
- `v` is an integer representing the index of the failing server.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, i + 1)` represents a connection between consecutive indices from `0` to `n-2`.
- `node1_nr` is `1`.

We need to check which of these need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Adjusting `m`:**
   - The initial value of `m` is `m - (n - 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `m` is initially `m - (n - 1)`, the smallest possible value for `m` is when `m = 1`, which would make `m - (n - 1) = 1 - (n - 1) = 2 - n`.
   - Therefore, to ensure `m > 0`, `m - (n - 1)` must be greater than 0.
   - This implies `m > n - 1`.

2. **Adjusting `node1_nr`:**
   - `node1_nr` is currently `1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `node1_nr` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `node1_nr` is `1`, this condition is already satisfied as long as `n > 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `m` needs to be adjusted to ensure `m > n - 1`.
- The state of `node1_nr` is already in a valid state (`node1_nr = 1`), so no adjustment is needed here.

Thus, the final state required for the loop to execute at least one more time is:

**State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of servers; `m` must be greater than `n - 1`; `v` is an integer representing the index of the failing server; `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(i, i + 1)` represents a connection between consecutive indices from `0` to `n-2`; `node1_nr` is `1`**.
