`edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. This means that the list `edges` now contains this new tuple. The variables `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` remain unchanged. The conditions that `m` must be at least 2 and `node2_nr` must be less than `n - 1` are still valid.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, `m` must be at least 2, `node2_nr` must be less than `n - 1`**
