Postcondition: ***`m` is 0, `node1_nr` is `n + (n - 2)`, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`, and `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`) up to (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`). Since `m` is greater than 0 is false in the if condition, the `else` part does not execute, so the list `edges` remains unchanged.***
