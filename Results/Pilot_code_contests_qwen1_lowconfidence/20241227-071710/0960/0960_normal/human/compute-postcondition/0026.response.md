Let's analyze the given `while` loop step by step:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

We are given the following states right before the loop:
- `n` is greater than 3
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `node1_new` must be less than `n`
- `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the `while` loop need to be satisfied:
1. `m > 0`
2. `node2_nr < n`

Given these conditions, let's check each state:

1. **`m > 0`:**
   - The current state says `m` must be greater than 0. Since this condition is already met, no adjustment is needed for `m`.

2. **`node2_nr < n`:**
   - We know `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`.
   - For `node2_nr < n`, we need `node1_nr + 2 < n`.
   - Given `n` is greater than 3, the minimum value of `n` is 4 (since `n` is strictly greater than 3).
   - Therefore, `node1_nr + 2 < 4` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time.

To ensure `node1_nr + 2 < 4`, `node1_nr` must be less than 2 (since `node1_nr + 2` must be less than 4).

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `node1_new` must be less than 2.

Thus, the final state right before the loop should be:
- `n` is greater than 3
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `node1_new` must be less than 2
- `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `node1_new` must be less than 2, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`**
