`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The value of `node2_nr` was originally less than `n - 1`, so after incrementing, it is now one more than its original value but still less than `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, `m` is at least 1, `node2_nr` is one more than its original value and still less than `n`.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`, `m` is at least 1, `node2_nr` is one more than its original value and still less than `n`**
