Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State
- `n` is greater than 3
- `m` is greater than 0
- `node1_new` must be less than `n`
- `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`

### Loop Code
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
    edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))
    m -= 1
    node2_nr += 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **First Iteration:**
   - Condition: `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`
   - `edges` is updated with the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`
   - `m` is decremented by 1
   - `node2_nr` is incremented by 1
   - New state: `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node1_nr + 2)`

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - Condition: `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`
   - `edges` is updated with the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr + 1)`
   - `m` is decremented by 1
   - `node2_nr` is incremented by 1
   - New state: `edges` contains the tuples `(node1_nr, node1_nr + 2)` and `(node1_nr, node2_nr + 1)`

3. **General Iteration:**
   - For each iteration, the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr + i)` is added to `edges`
   - `m` is decremented by 1
   - `node2_nr` is incremented by 1
   - This continues until `m` reaches 0 or `node2_nr` reaches `n`

4. **Final State:**
   - When the loop exits, either `m` is 0 or `node2_nr` is no longer less than `n`.
   - `edges` will contain tuples starting from `(node1_nr, node1_nr + 2)` up to `(node1_nr, node2_nr - 1)`
   - `m` will be `0`
   - `node2_nr` will be `n` (if `m` was 0) or will be the last value it reached before exiting the loop (if `node2_nr` was no longer less than `n`)

### Final Output State

Given that `m` will be 0 when the loop exits, and `node2_nr` will be `n` (or just below `n`), the final state is:

Output State: **`m` is 0, `node2_nr` is `n`, `edges` is a list containing tuples `(node1_nr, node1_nr + 2)`, `(node1_nr, node1_nr + 3)`, ..., `(node1_nr, node2_nr - 1)`**
