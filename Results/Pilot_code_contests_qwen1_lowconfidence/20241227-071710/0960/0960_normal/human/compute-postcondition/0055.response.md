`node1_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `m` is 0, so `node2_nr` is initially `node1_nr + 2 + m`, which simplifies to `node1_nr + 2`. The list `edges` contains tuples starting from (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`) up to (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr + m - 1`), which simplifies to tuples from (`node1_nr`, `node1_nr + 2`) to (`node1_nr`, `node1_nr + 1`). Since `node2_nr` must be less than `n`, the updated `node1_nr` must also satisfy this condition.

After the code is executed, the updated values are:
- `m` remains 0 (unchanged)
- `node1_nr` is incremented by 1
- `node2_nr` is updated to `node1_nr + 2` (since `m` is 0)
- `edges` list remains the same, but `node1_nr` in each tuple is updated to the new value of `node1_nr`

Output State: **`m` is 0, `node1_nr` is `node1_nr` + 1, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr` + 2, `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`) up to (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr + m - 1`)**
