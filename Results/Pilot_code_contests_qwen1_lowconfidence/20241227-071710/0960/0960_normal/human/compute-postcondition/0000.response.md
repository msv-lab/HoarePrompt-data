The code `n, m, v = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `v`. These variables are initially defined in the precondition. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `v` will be the integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of servers, `m` is an integer representing the number of direct connections, and `v` is an integer representing the index of the failing server such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ v ≤ n; the actual values of `n`, `m`, and `v` are the integers provided by the input.**
