`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. Since `node2_nr` was previously less than `n` and now it is incremented by 1, the new value of `node2_nr` is one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` and the appended tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr + 1)`, `m` is at least 0, `node2_nr` is one more than its previous value and is still less than `n`.**
