`m` is decremented by 1. The original value of `m` was greater than 0, so after decrementing, `m` is now `m - 1`. The values of `node2_nr` and `edges` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `node2_nr` is less than `n`, `edges` is a list containing an additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
