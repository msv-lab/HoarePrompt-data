`m` is decremented by 1. The original value of `m` was greater than 0, so after decrementing, `m` is still greater than 0. The states of the other variables (`n`, `node1_new`, `node2_nr`, and `edges`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 0, `node1_new` must be less than 2, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`, `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node1_nr + 2)`**
