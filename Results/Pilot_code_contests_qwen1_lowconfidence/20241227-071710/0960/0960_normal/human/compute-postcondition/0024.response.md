Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 3
- `m` is 0
- `node1_nr` is increased by 1 (let's call this new value `node1_new`)
- `node2_nr` is `n - 1`
- `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from `(node1_new - 1, n - 1)` and ending at `(node1_new - 1, n - 1)`

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `m > 0 and node1_nr < n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `m > 0`:**
   - The current state shows `m` is 0, so for the loop to continue, we need to adjust `m` to be greater than 0.

2. **Condition `node1_nr < n`:**
   - The current state shows `node1_nr` is increased by 1 compared to the previous iteration, and `node1_new` is the new value of `node1_nr`.
   - Since `node1_new` is increased by 1, for the condition `node1_new < n` to hold true, we need to ensure that `node1_new` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To satisfy the condition `m > 0`, we need to change `m` to a positive value.
- To satisfy the condition `node1_new < n`, we need to ensure that `node1_new` remains less than `n`.

### Updated State:
- `n` is greater than 3
- `m` must be greater than 0 (for the loop to execute)
- `node1_new` must be less than `n` (to satisfy the loop condition)

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `node1_new` must be less than `n`**
