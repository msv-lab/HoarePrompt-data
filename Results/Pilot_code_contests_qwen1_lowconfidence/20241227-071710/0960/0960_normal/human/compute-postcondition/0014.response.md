Let's break down the given information and the conditions for the loop to execute one more time:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is greater than 3
   - `m` is greater than `n - 2`
   - `edges` is a list with one additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` appended to it
   - `node2_nr` is `m + 1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop must be true at the start of the next iteration:
- `m > 0`
- `node2_nr < n`

Given these conditions:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.

From the initial states:
- We know that `node2_nr` is `m + 1`.
- Therefore, for `node2_nr < n`, we need `m + 1 < n`.

Combining these, we need:
- `m > 0`
- `m + 1 < n`

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that these conditions are met. 

The state should be modified as follows:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `m + 1` must be less than `n`.

So, the final state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 0, and `m + 1` is less than `n`**
