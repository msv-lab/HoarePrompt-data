`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `node2_nr` was `m`, which is greater than `n - 2`. Since `n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 1. Therefore, the new value of `node2_nr` is `m + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3; `m` is greater than `n - 2`; `edges` is a list with one additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` appended to it; `node2_nr` is `m + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3; `m` is greater than `n - 2`; `edges` is a list with one additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` appended to it; `node2_nr` is `m + 1`**
