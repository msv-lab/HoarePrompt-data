`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. Initially, `node2_nr` is equal to `node1_nr + 2`. Since `node1_nr` is greater than 3 (because `n` is greater than 3 and assuming `node1_nr` is derived from `n`), `node1_nr + 2` means `node2_nr` is greater than 5. The increment operation increases `node2_nr` by 1, making it `node1_nr + 3`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 0, `node1_new` must be less than 2, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 3`, `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node1_nr + 2)`**
