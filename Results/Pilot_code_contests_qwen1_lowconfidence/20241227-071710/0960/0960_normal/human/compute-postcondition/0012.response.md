`m` is decremented by 1, reducing its value by 1. The values of `n` and `edges` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are: `n` is greater than 3; `m` is greater than `n - 1` - 1; `edges` is a list with one additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3; `m` is greater than `n - 2`; `edges` is a list with one additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` appended to it.**
