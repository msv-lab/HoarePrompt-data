`edges` is appended with a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`. The values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` are not specified in the initial state, but they are used to form a tuple and append it to the list `edges`. The conditions `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n` remain valid.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `node2_nr` is less than `n`; `edges` is a list containing an additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
