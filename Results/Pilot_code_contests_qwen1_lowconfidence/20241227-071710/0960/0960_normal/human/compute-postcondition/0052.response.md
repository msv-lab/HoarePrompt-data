`m` is decremented by 1, so the value of `m` is now `m - 1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` and the appended tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr + 1)`, `m` is at least 0, `node2_nr` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`**
