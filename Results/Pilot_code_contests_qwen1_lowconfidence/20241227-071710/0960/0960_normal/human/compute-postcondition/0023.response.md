`node1_nr` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains greater than 3, and the value of `m` remains 0. The list `edges` contains tuples starting from `(node1_nr - 1, node2_nr)` and ending at `(node1_nr - 1, n - 1)`. Since `node2_nr` is `n - 1`, the list `edges` effectively changes to start from `(node1_nr - 1, n - 1)` and end at `(node1_nr - 1, n - 1)`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `m` is 0, `node1_nr` is increased by 1, `node2_nr` is `n - 1`, and `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from `(node1_nr - 1, n - 1)` and ending at `(node1_nr - 1, n - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is 0, `node1_nr` is increased by 1, `node2_nr` is `n - 1`, and `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from `(node1_nr - 1, n - 1)` and ending at `(node1_nr - 1, n - 1)`**.
