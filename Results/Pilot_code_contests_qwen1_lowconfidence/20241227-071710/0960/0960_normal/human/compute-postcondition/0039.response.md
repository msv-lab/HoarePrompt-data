The code increments `node1_nr` by 1. Initially, `node1_nr` is set to `n`. After the increment, `node1_nr` becomes `n + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `node2_nr` is `n`, `edges` is a list containing tuples `(n + 1, n + 3)`, `(n + 1, n + 4)`, ..., `((n + 1) - 1, n - 1)`, `node1_nr` is `n + 1`**
