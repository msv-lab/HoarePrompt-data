The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The initial conditions of `n`, `m`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of servers, `m` is an integer representing the number of direct connections, and `v` is an integer representing the index of the failing server such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ v ≤ n; the actual values of `n`, `m`, and `v` are the integers provided by the input, and the number of direct connections (`m`) is less than the number of servers minus one (`n - 1`); -1 is printed to the console.**
