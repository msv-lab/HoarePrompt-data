`m` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `m` is `m - 1`. The values of `n` and `edges` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3; `m` is greater than 0, and now `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`; `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3; `m` is greater than 0, and now `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`; `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
