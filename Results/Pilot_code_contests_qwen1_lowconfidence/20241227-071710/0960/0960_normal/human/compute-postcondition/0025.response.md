`node2_nr` is assigned the value of `node1_nr + 2`. The value of `node1_nr` is not specified, but it must be a value that satisfies the initial conditions, which means it must be less than `n` (since `node1_new` must be less than `n`). The values of `n`, `m`, and `node1_new` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `node1_new` must be less than `n`, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`**
