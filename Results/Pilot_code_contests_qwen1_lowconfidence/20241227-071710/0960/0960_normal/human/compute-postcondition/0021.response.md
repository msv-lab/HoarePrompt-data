`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. Given that `node2_nr` was less than `n` initially and considering the condition `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, the new value of `node2_nr` will still be valid under these conditions. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` and possibly other tuples, and `node2_nr` is now equal to its original value plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` and possibly other tuples, and `node2_nr` is equal to its original value plus 1.**
