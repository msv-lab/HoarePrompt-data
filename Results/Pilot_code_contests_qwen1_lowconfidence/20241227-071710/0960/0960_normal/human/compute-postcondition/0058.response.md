The code `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `m`, `node1_nr`, `node2_nr`, or `edges`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `node1_nr` is `n + (n - 2)`, `node2_nr` is `node1_nr + 2`, `edges` is a list containing tuples starting from (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr`) up to (`node1_nr`, `node2_nr + m - 1`). The value of `m` is greater than 0**
