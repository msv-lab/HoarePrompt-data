`edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`. The code appends this tuple to the list `edges`. Since `node2_nr` must be incremented by 1 to be less than `n`, it implies that after incrementing `node2_nr` by 1, it is still less than `n`. However, the actual values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` are not provided, so we cannot specify their exact values after the increment. The list `edges` will contain the updated tuple.

Output State: **`edges` is a list containing the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` and the appended tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr + 1)`, `m` is at least 1, `node2_nr` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`**
