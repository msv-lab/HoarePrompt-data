`m` is decremented by 1. The original conditions state that `n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 0, and `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `m` was originally greater than 0, decrementing it by 1 will make it equal to a value that is still greater than or equal to 0 (since it was at least 1 before the decrement). Additionally, `m + 1` will now be less than `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `m + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` and possibly other tuples, and `node2_nr` is less than `n`.**
