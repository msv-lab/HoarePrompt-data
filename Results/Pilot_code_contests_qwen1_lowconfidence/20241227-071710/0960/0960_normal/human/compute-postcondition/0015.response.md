The code snippet `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. However, the code snippet does not provide the values of `node1_nr` and `node2_nr`, nor does it modify `n` or `m`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the only change is in the `edges` list, which now includes the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 0, and `m + 1` is less than `n`; `edges` contains the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
