`node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `node2_nr` is less than `n`, so after the increment, `node2_nr` is still less than `n`. The value of `m` remains unchanged, and the list `edges` does not change since no operation was performed on it. 

Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `node2_nr` is less than `n` + 1, `edges` is a list containing an additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)`**
