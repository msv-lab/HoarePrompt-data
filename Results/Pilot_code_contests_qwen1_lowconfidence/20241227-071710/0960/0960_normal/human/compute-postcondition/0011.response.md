The code `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))` appends a tuple containing `node1_nr` and `node2_nr` to the list `edges`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `node1_nr` and `node2_nr`. The only conditions provided are that `n` must be greater than 3 and `m` must be greater than `n - 1`. Since no values are assigned to `node1_nr` and `node2_nr`, they remain undefined. The conditions for `n` and `m` are preserved.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3; `m` is greater than `n - 1`; `edges` is a list with one additional tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` appended to it.**
