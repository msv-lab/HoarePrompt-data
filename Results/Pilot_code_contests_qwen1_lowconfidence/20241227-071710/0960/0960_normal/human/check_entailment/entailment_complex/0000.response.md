Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The program checks if `m` (the number of direct connections) is less than `n - 1` (the minimum required connections for the system to be connected). If `m` is indeed less, it prints `-1` and exits, which correctly indicates that it's impossible to satisfy the requirement with the given constraints.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - For `m >= n - 1`, the program constructs the graph such that all servers except the failing server (`v`) are connected. This is achieved through a series of nested loops that add edges to the graph. The structure ensures that every server is connected to at least one other server, except the failing server.
   
3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program assumes that `v` is a valid server index (1 ≤ v ≤ n). The logic within the program correctly handles the requirement to disconnect the system when server `v` fails. This is achieved by swapping the indices of server `v` and server `1` in the connectivity list, ensuring that the connection between server `v` and server `1` is broken.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the list of edges in the required format, with each edge represented as a tuple of server indices. The output respects the order and format specified in the problem statement.

Given the assumptions about valid input, the program correctly handles the problem requirements. The logic ensures that the system remains connected unless the specific server `v` is considered, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
