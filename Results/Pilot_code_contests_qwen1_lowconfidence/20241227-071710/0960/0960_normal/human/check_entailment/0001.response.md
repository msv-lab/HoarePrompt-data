Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of connections `m` is less than the minimum required to form a tree structure (i.e., `n-1`). According to the problem description, if it is impossible to connect the servers in the required way, the program should output `-1`. However, the program only checks if `m < n - 1` at the beginning and exits without considering the possibility that even if `m >= n - 1`, it might still be impossible to satisfy the condition that the removal of server `v` disconnects the network.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after constructing the initial tree, removing server `v` should break the network into at least two disconnected components. This can be checked by ensuring that server `v` is part of the constructed tree and that there are no additional connections that could keep the network connected after removing `v`.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 5 3
```

The program will output:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
```

However, if we remove server 3, the network remains connected because there is still a path from 1 to 4 via 2. Therefore, this configuration does not meet the requirement that the removal of server `v` should disconnect the network.
