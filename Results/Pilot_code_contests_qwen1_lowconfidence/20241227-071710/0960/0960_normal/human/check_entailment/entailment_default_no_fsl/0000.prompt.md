You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bob got a job as a system administrator in X corporation. His first task was to connect n servers with the help of m two-way direct connection so that it becomes possible to transmit data from one server to any other server via these connections. Each direct connection has to link two different servers, each pair of servers should have at most one direct connection. Y corporation, a business rival of X corporation, made Bob an offer that he couldn't refuse: Bob was asked to connect the servers in such a way, that when server with index v fails, the transmission of data between some other two servers becomes impossible, i.e. the system stops being connected. Help Bob connect the servers.

Input

The first input line contains 3 space-separated integer numbers n, m, v (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ v ≤ n), n — amount of servers, m — amount of direct connections, v — index of the server that fails and leads to the failure of the whole system.

Output

If it is impossible to connect the servers in the required way, output -1. Otherwise output m lines with 2 numbers each — description of all the direct connections in the system. Each direct connection is described by two numbers — indexes of two servers, linked by this direct connection. The servers are numbered from 1. If the answer is not unique, output any.

Program:

def func():
    (n, m, v) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if m < n - 1:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    edges = [(i, i + 1) for i in xrange(n - 1)]
    m = m - len(edges)
    node1_nr = 1
    while m > 0 and node1_nr < n:
        node2_nr = node1_nr + 2
        while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
            edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))
            m -= 1
            node2_nr += 1
        node1_nr += 1
    if m > 0:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    translate = [i + 1 for i in xrange(n)]
    (translate[v - 1], translate[1]) = (translate[1], translate[v - 1])
    output = ['%d %d' % (translate[n1], translate[n2]) for (n1, n2) in edges]
    print('\n'.join(output))


```
Output hints: The function `func()` accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of servers; `m`, the number of direct connections; and `v`, the index of the failing server. It first checks if the number of direct connections `m` is less than `n - 1`. If so, it prints `-1` and exits, indicating an invalid configuration. Otherwise, it constructs a list of edges connecting the servers. It then attempts to add additional edges to ensure all servers are connected, except for the failing server indexed by `v`. After ensuring the graph is fully connected (or printing `-1` if it cannot), it swaps the indices of the first and failing servers in the connectivity list. Finally, it prints the connectivity information for each edge, excluding the failing server, in a formatted string. Potential edge cases include invalid ranges for `n`, `m`, and `v`, and the function handles these by printing `-1` and exiting. Missing functionality includes no error handling for non-integer inputs or out-of-range `v` values beyond the initial check.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
