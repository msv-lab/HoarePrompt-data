Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the failing server `v` is the first server (index 1). According to the problem description, if the server with index `v` fails, the transmission of data between some other two servers becomes impossible. However, the code swaps the indices of the first server (index 1) and the failing server `v` in the connectivity list. This means that if `v` is 1, the first server's connections are effectively moved to the last server, which does not necessarily disconnect the rest of the network as required.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 6 1
```

The expected output should show a configuration where the first server is isolated, but the provided code will not achieve this because it swaps the first and the failing server's indices, which does not isolate the first server as required.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the failing server `v` is not connected to any other server directly or indirectly, which would require a more complex algorithm to achieve the desired disconnection.
