Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the server `v` being disconnected results in the entire system failing to remain connected. Specifically, the program constructs a graph that may not ensure the removal of server `v` disconnects the network. For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
5 6 3
```

Expected output would be a configuration where removing server 3 disconnects the network. However, the given implementation constructs a nearly complete graph, which does not necessarily fulfill the requirement. The edges constructed do not guarantee that removing server 3 will disconnect the system. Thus, the program does not meet the problem's requirements in all cases.
