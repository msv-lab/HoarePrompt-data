Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the requirement that when server `v` fails, the transmission of data between some other two servers becomes impossible. The code constructs a fully connected graph with the exception of the failing server `v`. While this ensures that the network remains connected until the failing server is removed, it does not guarantee that removing server `v` will disconnect the network in a way that fulfills the requirement.

For instance, consider the following case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `m = 6`, `v = 3`
- Expected output: A configuration where removing server 3 disconnects the network.
- Actual output: The provided code constructs a fully connected graph, and swapping the indices of server 3 and server 1 (the first server) ensures the graph remains connected even after removing server 3.

However, this configuration does not meet the requirement because the network remains fully connected even after server 3 is removed. The correct approach would involve creating a specific configuration where the removal of server `v` actually disconnects the network. For example, a star-like configuration centered around server `v` could be used, where all other servers are connected to `v`, and removing `v` would disconnect them.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    (n, m, v) = map(int, input().split())
    if m < n - 1:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    
    # Create a star-like configuration where v is the center
    edges = [(v, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1) if i + 1 != v]
    
    if len(edges) < m:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    
    # Add remaining edges to reach m
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            if len(edges) < m:
                edges.append((i + 1, j + 1))
                m -= 1
    
    if m > 0:
        print(-1)
        exit()
    
    translate = [i + 1 for i in range(n)]
    (translate[v - 1], translate[1]) = (translate[1], translate[v - 1])
    output = ['%d %d' % (translate[n1], translate[n2]) for (n1, n2) in edges]
    print('\n'.join(output))

func()
```

This implementation creates a star-like configuration where server `v` is the center, and all other servers are connected to `v`. Removing server `v` will indeed disconnect the network, fulfilling the requirement.
