The function `func_4()` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input data. It then returns this input. The function simply waits for the user to provide input and does not perform any further processing on the input. This means that any special characters or whitespace included in the user input will be returned as-is. There are no additional postconditions or transformations applied to the user input.
