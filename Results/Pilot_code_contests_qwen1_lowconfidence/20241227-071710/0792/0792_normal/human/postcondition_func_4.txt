The function `func_5` reads an integer from standard input (stdin) and returns it. The function does not take any parameters directly; instead, it relies on the user to provide the input through stdin. There are no postconditions specified beyond the return value, and the function does not modify any external state or variables. This implies that the function is idempotent and does not have side effects. The input must be a valid integer, otherwise the program behavior is undefined. No error handling is performed for non-integer inputs.
