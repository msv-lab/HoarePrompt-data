The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` (where \( n > 1 \)) and returns a list of all distinct factor pairs of `n`. It achieves this by iterating through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`. For each number `i` in this range, if `n` is divisible by `i`, both `i` and `n // i` are added to the list `l`. If `i` is equal to `n // i`, only one entry is added; otherwise, both entries are added to ensure all distinct factor pairs are included. This process ensures that no factors are missed and all pairs are unique.
