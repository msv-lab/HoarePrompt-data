#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and p is an integer such that 2 ≤ p ≤ n.
def func_1(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \( \text{pow}(n, p - 2, p) \), where \( n \) is a positive integer and \( p \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq p \leq n \)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `p` (an integer such that \(2 \leq p \leq n\)), and returns the result of \( \text{pow}(n, p - 2, p) \). The function computes the modular exponentiation \( n^{(p-2)} \mod p \). It ensures that \( p \) is within the valid range specified and uses the built-in `pow` function to perform the operation efficiently. If `p` is not within the valid range, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The final state of the program is that it returns the computed result or raises an error if the input conditions are not met.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no direct information about the variables in the function `func_2`'s signature provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the problem description and the context, we can infer that `func_4()` is a function that returns the input values for processing, which are then converted to integers and split into a list or tuple.
def func_2():
    return map(int, func_4().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts the output of func_4() split by spaces into integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and returns a map object that converts the output of `func_4()` into a list of integers, where `func_4()` splits its input string by spaces. This means the function takes a string returned by `func_4()`, splits it by spaces, and converts each resulting substring into an integer. Any non-integer values in the split result will raise a `ValueError`. If `func_4()` returns an empty string, the map object will also be empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables' values or their relationships are provided in the function signature or the program context. The function does not take any parameters and does not appear to be directly related to solving the described problem.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_4().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by converting each element in the list returned by `func_4().split()` to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes no parameters and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by calling `func_4()`, which presumably returns a string. This string is then split into a list of substrings using the `split()` method. Each substring is converted to an integer using the `map(int, ...)` function, resulting in a list of integers. If `func_4()` returns an empty string, the resulting list will be empty. If `func_4()` returns a string containing non-integer values, those substrings will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to integers, and the function will only include successfully converted integers in the output list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no information provided about the variables in the function signature for this specific function. The function does not take any parameters and is likely a placeholder or an incomplete part of the solution.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input data. It then returns this input. The function simply waits for the user to provide input and does not perform any further processing on the input. This means that any special characters or whitespace included in the user input will be returned as-is. There are no additional postconditions or transformations applied to the user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are present, implying the function does not take any input parameters directly. However, it reads input from stdin. The input consists of multiple lines as described in the problem description: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers p1, p2, ..., pn.
def func_5():
    return int(input())
    #The program reads an integer from stdin and returns it
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads an integer from standard input (stdin) and returns it. The function does not take any parameters directly; instead, it relies on the user to provide the input through stdin. There are no postconditions specified beyond the return value, and the function does not modify any external state or variables. This implies that the function is idempotent and does not have side effects. The input must be a valid integer, otherwise the program behavior is undefined. No error handling is performed for non-integer inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that \(|x| \leq 10^9\) and \(|y| \leq 10^9\).
def func_6(x, y):
    x = abs(x)
    y = abs(y)
    if (min(x, y) == 0) :
        return max(x, y)
        #The program returns the maximum value between x and y, where both x and y are their respective absolute values and the minimum of x and y is 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `x` is the absolute value of its original value, `y` is the absolute value of its original value, and the minimum of `x` and `y` is not equal to 0
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x_initial` and `y_initial`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x_initial` and `y_initial`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers such that \(|x| \leq 10^9\) and \(|y| \leq 10^9\). It performs the following actions based on the input values:

- If the minimum of the absolute values of `x` and `y` is 0, the function returns the maximum of the absolute values of `x` and `y`. This covers the case where one of the inputs is 0, and the other is non-zero. In this scenario, the function essentially returns the non-zero absolute value.

- Otherwise, the function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates, `x` will hold the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`, and `y` will be 0. The function then returns `x`.

This means that the function can either return the non-zero absolute value of the inputs if one of them is 0, or the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y` if both are non-zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that n > 1 and is related to the input parameter 'n' in the main problem description, which represents the length of the sequence p.
def func_7(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n // i == i:
                l.append(i)
            else:
                l.append(i)
                l.append(n // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a list of all distinct factor pairs of `n`
    return l
    #The program returns the list 'l' which contains all distinct factor pairs of 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts an integer `n` (where \( n > 1 \)) and returns a list of all distinct factor pairs of `n`. It achieves this by iterating through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`. For each number `i` in this range, if `n` is divisible by `i`, both `i` and `n // i` are added to the list `l`. If `i` is equal to `n // i`, only one entry is added; otherwise, both entries are added to ensure all distinct factor pairs are included. This process ensures that no factors are missed and all pairs are unique.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the upper limit for checking prime numbers, and it is used to generate a list of prime numbers up to n. However, this function does not directly relate to the main problem description and is not utilized within the provided main program context.
def func_8(n):
    prime = [(True) for i in range(n + 1)]
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if prime[p] == True:
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
        
        p += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `p` is the largest prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `prime[i]` is `False` if `i` is composite and `True` if `i` is prime, and `p` is one more than its previous value if \( p^2 > n \)
    f = []
    for p in range(2, n):
        if prime[p]:
            f.append(p)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is the largest prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n` and is at least 2, `f` is a list containing all the prime numbers less than or equal to `p` if `prime[p]` is true for any `p` in the range 2 to `n-1`, otherwise `f` remains an empty list.
    return f
    #The program returns list `f` which contains all the prime numbers less than or equal to `p` if `prime[p]` is true for any `p` in the range 2 to `n-1`, otherwise `f` remains an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8(n)` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, which represents the upper limit for checking prime numbers. It returns a list `f` containing all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. This is achieved through the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which iteratively marks the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. After executing the algorithm, the function constructs a list of all primes found up to `n` and returns this list. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is less than 2, the function returns an empty list since there are no prime numbers less than 2.

Missing functionality noted in the annotation is that the final state of `p` is not directly relevant to the returned list `f`. The key point is that `p` is the largest prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n` after the sieve process completes.
