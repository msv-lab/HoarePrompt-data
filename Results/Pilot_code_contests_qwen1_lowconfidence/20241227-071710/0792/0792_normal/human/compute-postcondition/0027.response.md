The code `prime[i] = False` sets the value of `prime[i]` to `False`. The values of `p` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The loop starts at `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` and the condition `p * p <= n` is still valid.

Output State: **`p` is one more than its previous value, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`, and the loop starts at `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`, `prime[i]` is `False`**
