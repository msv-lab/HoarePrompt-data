According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `p`. The loop starts at `p * p` and increments by `p` until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `p` is one more than its previous value.
- `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`.
- The loop starts at `p * p`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop needs to start at the next value that is a multiple of `p` and is greater than `p * p`.
- Since the loop increments by `p`, the next value of `i` will be `p * p + p`.

Given that `p` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, let's denote the new value of `p` as `p_new = p + 1`.

Therefore, the new starting point for the loop will be `(p_new) * p_new`.

The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `p` is now `p_new = p + 1`.
- `p * p` must still be less than or equal to `n`.
- The loop starts at `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`.

So, the state should be:
State: **`p` is one more than its previous value, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`, and the loop starts at `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`**
