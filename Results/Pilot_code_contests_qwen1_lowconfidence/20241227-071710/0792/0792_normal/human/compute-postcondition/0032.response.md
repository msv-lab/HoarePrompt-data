The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. Given the precondition that at the end of the iteration, \( p \) is one more than its previous value, and for all integers \( k \) where \( p \times p \leq k \leq n \) and \( k \% p == 0 \), \( prime[k] \) is `False`, the new value of `p` is now one more than its previous value.

The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **At the end of the iteration, \( p \) is one more than its previous value, and for all integers \( k \) where \( p \times p \leq k \leq n \) and \( k \% p == 0 \), \( prime[k] \) is `False`. If \( p \times p > n \), this condition holds true for the next iteration as well; `p` is one more than its previous value.**
