According to the code, the loop starts from `p * p` and increments by `p` until it reaches or exceeds `n + 1`. The loop condition is based on the values of `i`, `p`, and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `p * p`
- `p` is some integer
- `n` is some integer such that `p * p` ≤ `n`
- `prime[p * p]` is `False`

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` must be incremented by `p`.
2. `i` should still be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

Let's calculate the new value of `i`:
- The current `i` is `p * p`.
- After incrementing by `p`, the new `i` will be `p * p + p = p * (p + 1)`.

For the loop to continue, the new `i` (`p * (p + 1)`) must still be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `p * p` ≤ `n`, adding `p` to `p * p` means we are checking if `p * (p + 1)` is within the range `[p * p, n + 1]`.

Given this, the new state will be:
- `i` becomes `p * (p + 1)`
- `p` remains the same
- `n` remains the same

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `p * (p + 1)`, `p` is some integer, `n` is some integer such that `p * p` ≤ `n`, `prime[p * (p + 1)]` is undefined (since it hasn't been checked yet)**
