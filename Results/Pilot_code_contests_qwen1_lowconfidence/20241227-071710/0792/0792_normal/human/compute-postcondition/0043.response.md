The code appends the value of `p` to the list `f`. Since `p` is the next prime number less than or equal to the square root of \( n \) and is at least 2, and `p+1` must be within the range 2 to \( n-1 \), the only variable that changes is `f`, which now includes the value of `p`.

Output State: **`p` is the next prime number less than or equal to the square root of \( n \) and is at least 2, and \( p+1 \) must be within the range 2 to \( n-1 \); `f` is a list containing the element `p`**
