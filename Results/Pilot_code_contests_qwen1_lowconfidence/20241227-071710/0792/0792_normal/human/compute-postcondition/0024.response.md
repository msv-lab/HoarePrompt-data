To ensure the for loop executes, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start. The loop will iterate over values starting from \( p^2 \) up to \( n \) with a step size of \( p \). Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Initialization of \( p \)**: Since \( p \) is one more than its previous value at the end of the previous iteration, we need to know what \( p \) is at the start of this new loop.
2. **Condition \( p \times p \leq n \)**: This condition must hold true for the loop to start executing. If \( p \times p > n \), the loop won't execute at all.
3. **Range Start**: The loop starts at \( p^2 \).
4. **Range End**: The loop ends at \( n \) inclusive.
5. **Step Size**: The step size is \( p \).

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustments to the initial state are:

- \( p \) should be known as it is one more than its previous value.
- The condition \( p \times p \leq n \) must hold true.
- The loop will start at \( p^2 \).

Therefore, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

State: **`p` is one more than its previous value, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`, and the loop starts at `p^2`**
