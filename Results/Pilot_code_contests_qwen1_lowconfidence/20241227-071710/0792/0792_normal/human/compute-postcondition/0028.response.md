Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `p` is one more than its previous value.
  - `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`.
  - The loop starts at `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` and uses `prime[i]` as `False`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over values starting from `p * p` up to `n + 1` with a step size of `p`.
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one value `i` such that `p * p <= i <= n` and `i % p == 0`.

2. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `p` is one more than its previous value.
   - `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - The loop starts at `(p + 1) * (p + 1)` and uses `prime[i]` as `False`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **Value of `p`:**
  - Since `p` is one more than its previous value, letâ€™s denote the new value of `p` as `p_new = p + 1`.

- **Condition for Loop Execution:**
  - The loop will continue if there is any value `i` in the range `[p_new * p_new, n]` that is divisible by `p_new`.

- **New State:**
  - `p` should be updated to `p_new`.
  - `p * p` must still be less than or equal to `n`.
  - The loop starts at `(p_new + 1) * (p_new + 1)`, but since we are adjusting the state before entering the loop, we will use `p_new * p_new` as the starting point.
  - `prime[i]` remains `False`.

### Final State:
- `p` is now `p + 1`.
- `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`.
- The loop will start at `(p * p)`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`p` is one more than its previous value, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`, and the loop starts at `(p * p)`**.
