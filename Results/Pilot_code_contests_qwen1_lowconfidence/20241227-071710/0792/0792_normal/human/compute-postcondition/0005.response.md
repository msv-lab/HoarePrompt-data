`prime[i]` is assigned the value `False`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4. Therefore, `prime[4]` is set to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `True` except for `prime[4]` which is `False`, `n` must be at least 4, `p` is `2`, `i` is `4`**
