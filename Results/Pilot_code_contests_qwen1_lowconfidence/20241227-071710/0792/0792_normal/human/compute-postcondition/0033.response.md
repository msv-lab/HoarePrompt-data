Output State: **`p` is the largest prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `prime[i]` is `False` if `i` is composite and `True` if `i` is prime, and `p` is one more than its previous value if \( p^2 > n \)**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates as long as \( p \times p \leq n \). This ensures that all composite numbers up to \( n \) are marked as `False` in the `prime` list.
- Each time the loop runs, it increments \( p \) to check the next potential prime number.
- Once \( p \times p > n \), the loop stops because all composites up to \( n \) would have already been marked.
- By the end of the loop, \( p \) will be the largest prime number less than or equal to the square root of \( n \), and the `prime` list will indicate whether each number from 0 to \( n \) is prime or composite.
