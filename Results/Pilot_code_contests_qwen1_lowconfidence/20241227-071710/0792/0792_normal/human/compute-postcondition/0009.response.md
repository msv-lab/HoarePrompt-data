The code sets `prime[i]` to `False`, where `i` is `8`. Given the initial state, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `True` except for `prime[4]` and `prime[6]`, which are `False`. Since `i` is `8`, the value of `prime[8]` is now set to `False`.

The states of the other variables (`prime`, `i`, `n`, and `p`) are updated accordingly. The value of `n` remains such that `n + 1` is the length of the `prime` list, and `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `True` except for `prime[4]`, `prime[6]`, and `prime[8]` which are `False`, `i` is `8`, `n` must be at least `7`, `p` is `2`**
