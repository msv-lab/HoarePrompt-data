`prime[i]` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `i` is `p * (p + 1)`. The state of `p` and `n` remains unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `p * (p + 1)` and `prime[i]` is `False`; `p` is some integer; `n` is some integer such that `p * p` ≤ `n`; `prime[p * (p + 1)]` is undefined.

Output State: **`i` is `p * (p + 1)` and `prime[i]` is `False`; `p` is some integer; `n` is some integer such that `p * p` ≤ `n`; `prime[p * (p + 1)]` is undefined.**
