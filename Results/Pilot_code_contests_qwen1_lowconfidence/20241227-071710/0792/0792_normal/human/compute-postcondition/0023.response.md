Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `p` is an integer equal to its previous value + 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that \( p^2 \leq n \).
   - For every \( i \) in the range \([p^2, n]\) where \( i \) is a multiple of \( p \), `prime[i]` is `False`.
   - If \( p^2 > n \), the `prime` array remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as \( p \times p \leq n \).

3. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, the condition \( p \times p \leq n \) must be true.
   - Given that \( p \) is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to ensure that \( p \times p \leq n \) holds true.

4. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( p \) is one more than its previous value.
   - We need to check if \( p \times p \leq n \) still holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Condition Analysis:**
   - If \( p^2 \leq n \) at the end of the previous iteration, then \( p \) will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the new \( p \) (which is \( p + 1 \)) should satisfy \( (p + 1)^2 \leq n \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \( p \) is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to ensure that \( (p + 1)^2 \leq n \) for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `p` is an integer equal to its previous value + 2, and \( (p + 1)^2 \leq n \).**

This ensures that the new value of \( p \) (i.e., \( p + 1 \)) satisfies the loop condition \( p \times p \leq n \).
