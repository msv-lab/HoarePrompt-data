To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `p * p <= n`.

Given the information:
- `p` is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to the square root of `n` plus one.
- The loop continues as long as `p * p <= n`.

Let's analyze the current state and what needs to change for the loop to continue:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `False` starting from index `p * p` up to `n`.
   - `p` is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to the square root of `n` plus one.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `p * p <= n`.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `p * p` must be strictly less than or equal to `n` at the start of the next iteration.
   - This means that `p` itself should be increased to the next smallest prime number such that `p * p > n`.

Since the loop condition `p * p <= n` must be true at the beginning of the next iteration, `p` must be incremented to the next prime number so that `p * p` becomes greater than `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `p` has been updated to the next smallest prime number such that `p * p > n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `False` starting from index `p * p` up to `n`; `p` is the next smallest prime number such that `p * p > n`**
