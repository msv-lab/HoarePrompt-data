`p` is incremented by 1, which means `p` now holds the value of its previous value plus 1. The states of the other variables (`n` and `prime`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`p` is an integer equal to its previous value + 1, and `n` is an integer such that \( p^2 \leq n \); for every \( i \) in the range \([p^2, n]\) where \( i \) is a multiple of \( p \), `prime[i]` is `False`. If \( p^2 > n \), the `prime` array remains unchanged.**
