The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer representing the upper limit for checking prime numbers. The function returns a list `f` which contains all the prime numbers less than or equal to `p` if `prime[p]` is true for any `p` in the range 2 to `n-1`, otherwise `f` remains an empty list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept an integer `n` and return a list of prime numbers up to `n` based on the condition that `prime[p]` is true for `p` in the range 2 to `n-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, and returns a list of prime numbers up to `n` if `prime[p]` is true for any `p` in the range 2 to `n-1`, otherwise it returns an empty list.**
