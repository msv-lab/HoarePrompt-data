Postcondition: ***`prime` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is `False` starting from index `p * p` up to `n`. `p` is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, and `n` is a positive integer at least 4. If `prime[p]` is `True`, then the elements in the range `[p * p, n]` are updated to `False` starting from the last updated index `i` which is a multiple of `p`. If `prime[p]` is `False`, no updates are made to the list.***
