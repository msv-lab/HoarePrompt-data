The code `prime[i] = False` sets the value of `prime[i]` to `False`. The variables `p` and `n` are not directly affected by this line of code, and their conditions (such as `p * p` being less than or equal to `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is one more than its previous value, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`, and the loop starts at `p^2`; `prime[i]` is `False`.

Output State: **`p` is one more than its previous value, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`, and the loop starts at `p^2`; `prime[i]` is `False`**
