The code snippet appends the value of `p` to the list `f`. Initially, `f` is either `[p]` if `prime[p]` is true, or an empty list if `prime[p]` is false. After appending `p` to `f`, `f` will contain `p` in either case.

Output State: **`p` is the next prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and `p` is at least 2; if `prime[p]` is true, then `f` is a list containing `[p]`, otherwise `f` remains an empty list, and `f` now contains `p`.**
