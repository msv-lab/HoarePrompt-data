Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the insertion of random characters between the words and the hearts correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not account for any characters that might be inserted randomly between the words and the hearts. This means that the program will only check if the cleaned message (removing all non-alphabetic characters) matches the concatenated words with hearts, which is insufficient according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
- Word list: `["i", "am", "not", "main", "in", "the", "family"]`
- Encoded message: `<3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3`

The program would fail to identify this as correct because it does not account for the random insertion of characters (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, etc.) between the words and the hearts.
