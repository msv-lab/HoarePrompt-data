Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle several potential edge cases and scenarios as specified in the problem description:

1. **Empty `word_list`:** If `word_list` is empty, the function `func_2` will still attempt to compare `encoding_str` with `message_str`, leading to an incorrect result. The function should handle this case separately and return `'no'`.

2. **Empty `encoding`:** If `encoding` is an empty string or contains no `<3` delimiters, the function assumes there are at least three parts separated by `<3`. This assumption is incorrect, and the function should handle this case by returning `'no'`.

3. **Missing or extra characters:** The function `func_2` does not account for any random characters that Dima might insert into the encoded message. These characters could affect the final comparison, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Incorrect word order:** The function `func_2` assumes that the words in the encoded message are in the correct order. However, the problem description does not guarantee that the words in the encoded message are in the same order as in `word_list`.

To fix these issues, the function needs to be modified to handle these edge cases properly. For example, it should check for empty `word_list` and `encoding`, and ensure that the words in the encoded message are in the correct order.
