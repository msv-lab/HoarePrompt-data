Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program still fails to correctly handle the random insertion of characters between the words and the hearts. Although the `func_1` function removes non-alphabetic characters, the `func_2` function does not account for the possibility of these random characters being present in the encoded message. The function `func_2` only checks if the cleaned message matches the concatenated words with hearts, which is insufficient given the problem description.

To properly handle the problem, the program needs to verify if the encoded message can be split into parts that match the pattern `<3word<3` plus any random characters inserted between these parts. The current implementation does not address this requirement, hence the program is not correct according to the problem description.
