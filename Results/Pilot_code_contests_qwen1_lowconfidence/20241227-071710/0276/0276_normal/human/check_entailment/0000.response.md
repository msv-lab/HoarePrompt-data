Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the insertion of random characters into the encoded message. Specifically, the program only checks for the presence of words separated by "<3" and ignores any additional characters that may be present in the encoded message. For example, consider the following input:

- Number of words: `3`
- Words: `i`, `love`, `you`
- Encoded message: `<3i<3love<23you<3randomcharacters`

The program would incorrectly return "yes" because it only checks for the presence of the words separated by "<3". However, the correct output should be "no" since the encoded message contains extra characters that were not part of the original encoding process.
