Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle several edge cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement and the output hints:

1. **Empty Encoding or No `<3` Delimiters**: The function `func_2` assumes that the `encoding` string contains at least three parts separated by `<3`. If `encoding` is an empty string or does not contain the required `<3` delimiters, the function will incorrectly return `'no'` without properly handling these cases.

2. **Empty Word List**: The function `func_2` compares `encoding_str` with `message_str`, but it does not handle the case where `word_list` is empty. If `word_list` is empty, `message_str` will also be empty, and the comparison `encoding_str == message_str` will fail, leading to an incorrect result.

These issues indicate that the code does not fully meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
