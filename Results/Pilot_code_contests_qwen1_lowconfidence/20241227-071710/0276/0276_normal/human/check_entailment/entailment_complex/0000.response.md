Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle several edge cases as described in the problem description and the annotations:

1. **Empty `word_list`:** The code does not check if `word_list` is empty before proceeding with the comparison. If `word_list` is empty, the program will still attempt to construct `message_str` and `encoding_str`, leading to a failure in the comparison.

2. **Invalid `encoding`:** The code does not handle scenarios where `encoding` is an empty string or does not contain the required `<3` delimiters. The current implementation assumes `encoding` has at least three parts separated by `<3`, which may lead to incorrect results if this assumption is not met.

3. **Characters other than letters:** While the code filters out non-alphabetic characters using `func_1`, it does not explicitly handle cases where `encoding` contains characters other than letters, digits, '<', and '>', beyond filtering them out.

To fix these issues, the code should include checks for these edge cases and ensure that it adheres to the problem description for every potential input scenario.
