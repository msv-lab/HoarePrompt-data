Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle the insertion of random characters between the words and the hearts. The function `func_2` only checks if the cleaned message matches the concatenated words with hearts, without considering the random characters that can be inserted. According to the output hints, the function does not handle several edge cases and missing functionalities, such as empty `encoding` strings, empty `word_list`, and the presence of random characters. These issues mean that the program cannot correctly verify if the message was encoded in the specified manner. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
