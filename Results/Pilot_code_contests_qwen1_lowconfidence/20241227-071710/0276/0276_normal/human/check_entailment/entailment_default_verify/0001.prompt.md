You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Seryozha has a very changeable character. This time he refused to leave the room to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the two lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing text messages to each other.

Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their text messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all words, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is a sequence of two characters: the "less" characters (<) and the digit three (3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: <3word1<3word2<3 ... wordn<3.

Encoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of small English characters, digits, signs "more" and "less" into any places of the message.

Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is going to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find out if Dima encoded the message correctly. In other words, find out if a text message could have been received by encoding in the manner that is described above.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of words in Dima's message. Next n lines contain non-empty words, one word per line. The words only consist of small English letters. The total length of all words doesn't exceed 105. 

The last line contains non-empty text message that Inna has got. The number of characters in the text message doesn't exceed 105. A text message can contain only small English letters, digits and signs more and less.

Output

In a single line, print "yes" (without the quotes), if Dima decoded the text message correctly, and "no" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

3
i
love
you
&lt;3i&lt;3love&lt;23you&lt;3


Output

yes


Input

7
i
am
not
main
in
the
family
&lt;3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3


Output

no

Note

Please note that Dima got a good old kick in the pants for the second sample from the statement.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(string):
    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string))

#Function 2:
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        encoding_str += enc
    if encoding_str == message_str:
        return 'yes'
    else:
        return 'no'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the insertion of random characters between the words and the hearts correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not account for any characters that might be inserted randomly between the words and the hearts. This means that the program will only check if the cleaned message (removing all non-alphabetic characters) matches the concatenated words with hearts, which is insufficient according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
- Word list: `["i", "am", "not", "main", "in", "the", "family"]`
- Encoded message: `<3i&lt;&gt;3am&lt;3the&lt;3&lt;main&lt;3in&lt;3the&lt;3&gt;&lt;3family&lt;3`

The program would fail to identify this as correct because it does not account for the random insertion of characters (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, etc.) between the words and the hearts.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `encoding`, which is a string containing the encoded message with hearts (`<3`) marking the start and end of each word, and potentially random characters inserted in between; and `word_list`, which is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any encoding.

The function processes the `encoding` string by splitting it into tokens using `<3` as the delimiter. It then iterates over these tokens (excluding the first and last), applying a transformation function `func_1` to each token. If at any point `func_1` returns an empty string, the function immediately returns `'no'`. After processing all tokens, the function constructs a new string `encoding_str` by concatenating the transformed tokens and checks if this new string matches the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`. If they match, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `encoding` is an empty string or contains no `<3` delimiters, the function will not correctly handle this scenario. The current implementation assumes `encoding` has at least three parts separated by `<3`.
2. The function does not handle the case where `word_list` is empty. In such a case, the comparison `encoding_str == message_str` would fail due to mismatched lengths.
3. The function does not provide any feedback when both `'no'` cases are triggered.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
