Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle several edge cases and scenarios that the problem description and the output hints indicate should be considered. Specifically, the function `func_2` fails to account for:

1. An empty `encoding` string or one that does not contain the `<3` delimiter.
2. An empty `word_list`.
3. Random characters inserted between the words in the encoded message.

These issues mean that the function cannot accurately verify if the encoded message was generated correctly according to the specified rules. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is valid.
