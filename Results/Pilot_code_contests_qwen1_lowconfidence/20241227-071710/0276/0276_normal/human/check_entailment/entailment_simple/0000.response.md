Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Output Format Mismatch**: 
   - The problem description requires the output to be "yes" or "no". However, the program currently outputs "yes" or "no" as strings ("yes" and "no"). To match the exact requirement, the program should directly print "yes" or "no" instead of returning these values. The return statement should be replaced with `print('yes')` and `print('no')`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Input**:
   - The program assumes that the input will be in a specific form and does not validate or process the inputs as required. Specifically, the program does not check if the encoded string (`encoding`) starts and ends with `<3` and whether each word is properly marked with `<3` at the beginning and end.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` filters out non-alphabetic characters, but the problem description does not specify this behavior. The function should be used to ensure that the input message only contains alphabetic characters and possibly the `<3` markers.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` checks if the processed encoded message matches the original message. However, it does not properly reconstruct the encoded message by ensuring that the original `<3` markers are placed correctly. The function should ensure that the reconstructed message includes the correct number of `<3` markers at the beginning and end of each word.

To correct the program, the following changes should be made:

- Ensure that the input message starts and ends with `<3`.
- Properly reconstruct the encoded message by including the correct number of `<3` markers.
- Directly print "yes" or "no" instead of returning the value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    word_list = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
    encoding = input().strip()

    # Check if the encoded message starts and ends with <3
    if not (encoding.startswith('<3') and encoding.endswith('<3')):
        print('no')
        exit()

    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')[1:-1]
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''

    for enc in encoding_toks:
        # Remove non-alphabetic characters
        enc = ''.join(filter(str.isalpha, enc))

        if not enc:
            print('no')
            exit()

        encoding_str += enc + '<3'

    if encoding_str.strip() == message_str:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
```

With these changes, the program correctly verifies if the encoded message matches the original message according to the problem description.
