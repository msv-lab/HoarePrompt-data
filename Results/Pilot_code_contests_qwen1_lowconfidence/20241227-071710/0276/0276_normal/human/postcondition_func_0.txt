The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter, which is guaranteed to be non-empty and can contain small English letters, digits, and the characters '<' and '>'. It processes the input string by filtering out all characters that are not alphabetic (i.e., letters). The function then returns a new string consisting solely of the alphabetic characters from the original string. This means that all digits, '<', and '>' characters are removed from the output string. If the input string contains no alphabetic characters, the returned string will be empty.
