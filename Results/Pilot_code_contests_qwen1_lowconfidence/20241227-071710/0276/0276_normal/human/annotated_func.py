#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a non-empty string containing only small English letters, digits, and the characters '<' and '>'.
def func_1(string):
    return ''.join(filter(lambda x: x.isalpha(), string))
    #The program returns a string containing only alphabetic characters from the input string 'string', which is a non-empty string containing only small English letters, digits, and the characters '<' and '>'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter, which is guaranteed to be non-empty and can contain small English letters, digits, and the characters '<' and '>'. It processes the input string by filtering out all characters that are not alphabetic (i.e., letters). The function then returns a new string consisting solely of the alphabetic characters from the original string. This means that all digits, '<', and '>' characters are removed from the output string. If the input string contains no alphabetic characters, the returned string will be empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoding is a string containing the encoded message with hearts (<3) marking the start and end of each word, and potentially random characters inserted in between. word_list is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any encoding.
def func_2(encoding, word_list):
    encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')
    message_str = ''.join(word_list)
    encoding_str = ''
    for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
        enc = func_1(enc)
        
        if not enc:
            return 'no'
        
        encoding_str += enc
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`, `encoding_str` is the concatenation of the original `encoding_str` with the results of applying `func_1` to each element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, and `enc` is the result of the last call to `func_1(enc)` within the loop.
    if (encoding_str == message_str) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    else :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `encoding`, which is a string containing the encoded message with hearts (`<3`) marking the start and end of each word, and potentially random characters inserted in between; and `word_list`, which is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any encoding.

The function processes the `encoding` string by splitting it into tokens using `<3` as the delimiter. It then iterates over these tokens (excluding the first and last), applying a transformation function `func_1` to each token. If at any point `func_1` returns an empty string, the function immediately returns `'no'`. After processing all tokens, the function constructs a new string `encoding_str` by concatenating the transformed tokens and checks if this new string matches the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`. If they match, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `encoding` is an empty string or contains no `<3` delimiters, the function will not correctly handle this scenario. The current implementation assumes `encoding` has at least three parts separated by `<3`.
2. The function does not handle the case where `word_list` is empty. In such a case, the comparison `encoding_str == message_str` would fail due to mismatched lengths.
3. The function does not provide any feedback when both `'no'` cases are triggered.
