string is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, digits, and "<" and ">". The string represents a potentially encoded message. The number of words before encoding is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and each word is a non-empty string consisting only of lowercase English letters. The total length of all words does not exceed 10^5, and the length of the encoded message does not exceed 10^5.
