The code `enc = func_1(enc)` impacts the value of `enc`. Initially, `enc` was the element at index 3 in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`. After running the code, `enc` is now `func_1(enc)`, meaning it has been modified by the function `func_1`.

- `encoding_toks` remains unchanged.
- `encoding_str` remains unchanged.
- `enc` is updated to `func_1(enc)`.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `enc` is `func_1(enc)`, `encoding_str` is the original string concatenated with `func_1(element_at_index_3)`**
