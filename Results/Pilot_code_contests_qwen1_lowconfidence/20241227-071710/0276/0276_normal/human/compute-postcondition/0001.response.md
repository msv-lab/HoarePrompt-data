The code `message_str = ''.join(word_list)` joins all the strings in the `word_list` into a single string, `message_str`. This operation does not affect the `encoding_toks` or change the nature of `word_list`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `encoding` at every occurrence of `<3`; `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any encoding; `message_str` is the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`.**
