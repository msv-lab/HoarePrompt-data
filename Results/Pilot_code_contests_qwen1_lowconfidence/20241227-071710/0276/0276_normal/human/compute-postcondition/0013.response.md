`encoding_str` is updated by adding the value of `enc` to it. Since `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`, the value of `encoding_str` becomes the original `encoding_str` concatenated with `func_1(element_at_index_3)` and then further concatenated with `func_1(enc)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `enc` is `func_1(enc)`, `encoding_str` is the original string concatenated with `func_1(element_at_index_3)` and then concatenated with `func_1(enc)`.**
