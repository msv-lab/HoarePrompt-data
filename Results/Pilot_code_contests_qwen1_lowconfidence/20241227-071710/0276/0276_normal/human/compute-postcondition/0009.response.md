Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements.
   - `word_list` is a list of strings.
   - `message_str` is the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`.
   - `encoding_str` is the original string concatenated with `func_1(enc)`, where `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.
   - This means the loop starts from the second element (index 1) and ends just before the last element (index -1).

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `enc` was the current element being processed.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]` needs to be considered.
   - The next element will be the one after `enc`.

5. **Updating States:**
   - `encoding_toks`: Since we are moving to the next element, we need to consider the next element in the slice `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.
   - `enc`: This will be updated to the next element in the slice.
   - `encoding_str`: The new value of `encoding_str` will be the concatenation of `encoding_str` with `func_1(next_enc)`, where `next_enc` is the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.

6. **Final Updated States:**
   - `encoding_toks` remains the same as it is not exhausted yet.
   - `enc` becomes the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.
   - `encoding_str` updates to include the next element processed.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `enc` is the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, `encoding_str` is the original string concatenated with `func_1(next_enc)`**.

To provide the exact values:
- If the previous `enc` was the element at index 1, the next `enc` would be at index 2.
- If the previous `enc` was the element at index 2, the next `enc` would be at index 3 (if it exists).

Assuming the previous `enc` was the element at index 2, the next `enc` would be at index 3. Therefore, the updated states would be:
State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `enc` is the element at index 3 in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, `encoding_str` is the original string concatenated with `func_1(element_at_index_3)`**.
