The code `encoding_toks = encoding.split('<3')` splits the string `encoding` at every occurrence of the substring `<3`. This operation creates a list of substrings from `encoding`, where each substring is a segment of `encoding` that is separated by `<3`.

Given the initial state:
- `encoding` is a string containing the encoded message with hearts (`<3`) marking the start and end of each word, and potentially random characters inserted in between.
- `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any encoding.

After executing the code:
- `encoding_toks` will be a list of substrings obtained by splitting `encoding` at every `<3`.

Since the exact content of `encoding` is not specified, we cannot provide specific values for `encoding_toks`. However, we know that each element in `encoding_toks` will be a segment of `encoding` between two `<3>` markers (or before the first `<3>` and after the last `<3>`).

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `encoding` at every occurrence of `<3`; `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any encoding.**
