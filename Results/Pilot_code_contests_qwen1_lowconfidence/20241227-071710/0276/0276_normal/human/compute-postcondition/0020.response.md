Postcondition: ***`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`, `encoding_str` is the concatenation of the original `encoding_str` with the results of applying `func_1` to each element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, and `enc` is the result of the last call to `func_1(enc)` within the loop. The current value of `encoding_str` is equal to `message_str`***
