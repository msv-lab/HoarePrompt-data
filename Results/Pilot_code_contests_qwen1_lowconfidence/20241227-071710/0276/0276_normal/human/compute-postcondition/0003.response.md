To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `encoding_toks` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `encoding` at every occurrence of `<3`.
- `word_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any encoding.
- `message_str` is the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`.
- `encoding_str` is an empty string.

### Loop Statement:
```
for enc in encoding_toks[1:-1]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `encoding_toks`:**
   - `encoding_toks` is a list, and it is created by splitting `encoding` at every occurrence of `<3`.

2. **Range of the For Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, meaning it skips the first and the last elements of `encoding_toks`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements (since it needs to access elements from index 1 to -1).
   - The loop body is omitted, but the key point is ensuring that there are valid elements to iterate over.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `encoding_toks` has at least 3 elements to allow the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`, `encoding_str` is an empty string, and the loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.**

In summary:
State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`, `encoding_str` is an empty string**
