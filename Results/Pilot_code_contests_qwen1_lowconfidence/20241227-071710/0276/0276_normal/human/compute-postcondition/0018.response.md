The code `encoding_str += enc` concatenates the value of `enc` to `encoding_str`. The initial state is that `encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `encoding_str` is the original string concatenated with `func_1(element_at_index_3)` and then concatenated with `func_1(enc)`. The value of `enc` is either 'no' if it is an empty string, or it does not return anything otherwise.

Given the initial state, `encoding_str` is already constructed with the appropriate concatenations. The value of `encoding_str` remains unchanged because the code simply appends `enc` to `encoding_str`, and there is no new value provided for `enc` in this snippet. Thus, the value of `encoding_str` stays as it was before.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `encoding_str` is the original string concatenated with `func_1(element_at_index_3)` and then concatenated with `func_1(enc)`.**
