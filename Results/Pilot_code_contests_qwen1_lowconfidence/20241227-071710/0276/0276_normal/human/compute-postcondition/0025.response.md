Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `encoding`, which is a string containing the encoded message with hearts (`<3`) marking the start and end of each word, and potentially random characters inserted in between; and `word_list`, which is a list of strings, where each string is a word from Dima's original message without any encoding.

The function processes the `encoding` string by splitting it into tokens using `<3` as the delimiter. It then iterates over these tokens (excluding the first and last), applying a transformation function `func_1` to each token. If at any point `func_1` returns an empty string, the function immediately returns `'no'`. After processing all tokens, the function constructs a new string `encoding_str` by concatenating the transformed tokens and checks if this new string matches the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`. If they match, the function returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `encoding` is an empty string or contains no `<3` delimiters, the function will not correctly handle this scenario. The current implementation assumes `encoding` has at least three parts separated by `<3`.
2. The function does not handle the case where `word_list` is empty. In such a case, the comparison `encoding_str == message_str` would fail due to mismatched lengths.
3. The function does not provide any feedback when both `'no'` cases are triggered.**

This summary covers the main functionality and highlights potential edge cases and missing handling in the code.**
