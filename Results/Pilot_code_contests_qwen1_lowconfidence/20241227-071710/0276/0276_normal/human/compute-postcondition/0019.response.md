Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`, `encoding_str` is the concatenation of the original `encoding_str` with the results of applying `func_1` to each element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, and `enc` is the result of the last call to `func_1(enc)` within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, which means it skips the first and last elements of `encoding_toks`. For each `enc` in this sublist, it applies `func_1` and appends the result to `encoding_str`.
- After the loop completes, `encoding_str` contains the concatenation of the original `encoding_str` with the results of applying `func_1` to each element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.
- Since the loop only processes elements from `encoding_toks[1:-1]`, `encoding_toks` must have at least 3 elements to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- The value of `enc` will be the result of the last call to `func_1(enc)` within the loop, but it doesn't affect the final state of `encoding_str` because the loop exits when there are no more elements to process in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `encoding_toks` has fewer than 3 elements), then:
- `encoding_toks` still has at least 3 elements.
- `word_list` remains unchanged.
- `message_str` remains unchanged.
- `encoding_str` is still the original empty string.
- `enc` will be undefined since the loop does not run.
