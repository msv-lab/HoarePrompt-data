Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements.
   - `enc` is `func_1(enc)`.
   - `encoding_str` is the original string concatenated with `func_1(element_at_index_3)` and then concatenated with `func_1(enc)`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `encoding_toks[1:-1]`. This means it starts from the second element (index 1) and ends just before the last element (index -1).

3. **Current State:**
   - Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, the current `enc` value being processed is the one at the current index, which is one less than the current index (since we start from index 1).
   - The `encoding_toks` list is still the same, but now the `enc` variable holds the result of `func_1` applied to the current element at the loop index.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the loop needs to process the next element in the range `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.
   - This means we need to move to the next element in the list, which would be the next index after the current one.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `encoding_toks` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `enc` will be updated to the next element in the list after applying `func_1`.
   - The index of the current element being processed will increase by 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `enc` is `func_1(element_at_next_index)`, where `element_at_next_index` is the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`.
- `encoding_str` will include the concatenation based on the new `enc` value.

State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `enc` is `func_1(element_at_next_index)`, `encoding_str` is the original string concatenated with `func_1(element_at_index_3)` and then concatenated with `func_1(enc)` where `element_at_next_index` is the next element in `encoding_toks[1:-1]`**.
