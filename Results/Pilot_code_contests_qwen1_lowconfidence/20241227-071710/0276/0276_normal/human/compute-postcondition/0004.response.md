The code snippet `enc = func_1(enc)` modifies the variable `enc` by calling `func_1` on its current value. However, the function `func_1` is not defined, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `enc`. The other variables `encoding_toks`, `word_list`, `message_str`, and `encoding_str` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`encoding_toks` is a list with at least 3 elements, `word_list` is a list of strings, `message_str` is the concatenation of all strings in `word_list`, `encoding_str` is an empty string, `enc` is the result of `func_1(enc)`**
