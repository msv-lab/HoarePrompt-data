#State of the program right berfore the function call: h and w are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 300 and 1 <= w <= 300.
def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
        
        print('')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, the print statements have executed `h * w` times, printing `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` or `.` otherwise, and `h - 1` empty lines have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates and prints a grid of size `h` by `w` where each cell is either a `#` or a `.` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. Specifically, the cell is `#` if the sum of its row index `i` and column index `j` is even, and `.` if it is odd. After executing the function, the grid is printed to the console, consisting of `h * w` characters, with `h - 1` blank lines separating the rows. The function does not return any value. An edge case to consider is when `h` or `w` is 1, which still adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 300\). In such cases, the grid will contain either a single row or a single column of alternating `#` and `.` characters. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly implements the described behavior.
