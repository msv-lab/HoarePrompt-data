This function generates and prints a grid of size `h` by `w` where each cell is either a `#` or a `.` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. Specifically, the cell is `#` if the sum of its row index `i` and column index `j` is even, and `.` if it is odd. After executing the function, the grid is printed to the console, consisting of `h * w` characters, with `h - 1` blank lines separating the rows. The function does not return any value. An edge case to consider is when `h` or `w` is 1, which still adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 300\). In such cases, the grid will contain either a single row or a single column of alternating `#` and `.` characters. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly implements the described behavior.
