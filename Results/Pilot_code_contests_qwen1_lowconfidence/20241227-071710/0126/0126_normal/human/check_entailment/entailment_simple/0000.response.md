Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses a `while True` loop to continuously read inputs until both `H` and `W` are zero.
   - When both `H` and `W` are zero, the loop breaks, ensuring that the program stops reading further datasets.
   - The use of `raw_input().split()` correctly reads two space-separated integers, `H` and `W`.

2. **Chessboard Drawing Logic:**
   - The `func_1` function takes `H` and `W` as parameters.
   - It iterates over rows (`i`) from `0` to `H-1`.
   - For each row, it iterates over columns (`j`) from `0` to `W-1`.
   - It prints `#` if the sum of the current row index `i` and column index `j` is even, and `.` if the sum is odd.
   - After completing a row, it prints a newline character to separate rows.
   - This logic ensures that the pattern alternates correctly between `#` and `.` as required for a chessboard.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the chessboard correctly, ensuring that the top-left corner is `#`.
   - It includes the required blank line after each dataset, which is crucial for separating different chessboards in the output.

4. **Constraints Compliance:**
   - The program handles the constraints `1 ≤ H ≤ 300` and `1 ≤ W ≤ 300` by validating the input values within these ranges using the conditions `if h == 0 and w == 0: break`.

Given the above points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description accurately and consistently for every valid input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
