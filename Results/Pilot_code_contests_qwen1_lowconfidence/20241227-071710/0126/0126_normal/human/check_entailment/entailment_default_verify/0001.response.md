Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly generates a chessboard pattern where the top-left corner is always `'#'`. The output hints clarify that the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` was adjusted to `i % 2 == 0` to ensure the top-left corner is `'#'`. The revised code now correctly handles the generation of the chessboard according to the given constraints and requirements. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect the correctness of the program.
