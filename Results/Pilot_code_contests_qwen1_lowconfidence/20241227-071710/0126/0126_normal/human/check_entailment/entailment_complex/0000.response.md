Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads pairs of integers \(H\) and \(W\) from the standard input until it encounters \(H = 0\) and \(W = 0\), which signifies the end of input. This matches the requirement to process multiple datasets until the termination condition is met.

2. **Function Definition and Execution**: The `func_1` function takes \(H\) and \(W\) as arguments and prints a chessboard of size \(H \times W\). The logic inside `func_1` ensures that the top-left corner is drawn using `#`, which is correct as per the problem description.

3. **Pattern Generation**: The pattern of `#` and `.` is generated based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`, which correctly alternates the characters across the grid. This ensures that the first cell (top-left) is `#` and the pattern follows the chessboard pattern.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like when \(H = 1\) or \(W = 1\) correctly. A single row or column will still follow the alternating pattern, which adheres to the problem description.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program prints each row followed by a newline, and there are \(H - 1\) blank lines between rows, which matches the expected output format.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the described behavior and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
