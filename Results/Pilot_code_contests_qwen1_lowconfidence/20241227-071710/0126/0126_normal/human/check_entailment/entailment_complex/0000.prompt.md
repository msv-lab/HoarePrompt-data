You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Draw a chessboard which has a height of H cm and a width of W cm. For example, the following figure shows a chessboard which has a height of 6 cm and a width of 10 cm.


.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#


Note that the top left corner should be drawn by '#'.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ H ≤ 300
* 1 ≤ W ≤ 300

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of two integers H and W separated by a single space.

The input ends with two 0 (when both H and W are zero).

Output

For each dataset, print the chessboard made of '#' and '.'.

Print a blank line after each dataset.

Example

Input

3 4
5 6
3 3
2 2
1 1
0 0


Output

#.#.
.#.#

#.#.#.
.#.#.#

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: h and w are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 300 and 1 <= w <= 300.
def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
        
        print('')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, the print statements have executed `h * w` times, printing `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` or `.` otherwise, and `h - 1` empty lines have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates and prints a grid of size `h` by `w` where each cell is either a `#` or a `.` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. Specifically, the cell is `#` if the sum of its row index `i` and column index `j` is even, and `.` if it is odd. After executing the function, the grid is printed to the console, consisting of `h * w` characters, with `h - 1` blank lines separating the rows. The function does not return any value. An edge case to consider is when `h` or `w` is 1, which still adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 300\). In such cases, the grid will contain either a single row or a single column of alternating `#` and `.` characters. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly implements the described behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
