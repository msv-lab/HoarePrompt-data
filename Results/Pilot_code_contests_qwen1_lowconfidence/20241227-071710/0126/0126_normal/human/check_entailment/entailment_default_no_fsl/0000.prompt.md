You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Draw a chessboard which has a height of H cm and a width of W cm. For example, the following figure shows a chessboard which has a height of 6 cm and a width of 10 cm.


.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#


Note that the top left corner should be drawn by '#'.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ H ≤ 300
* 1 ≤ W ≤ 300

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of two integers H and W separated by a single space.

The input ends with two 0 (when both H and W are zero).

Output

For each dataset, print the chessboard made of '#' and '.'.

Print a blank line after each dataset.

Example

Input

Program:
```
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
        print('')


```
Output hints: This function generates and prints a grid of size `h` by `w` where each cell is either a `#` or a `.` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. Specifically, the cell is `#` if the sum of its row index `i` and column index `j` is even, and `.` if it is odd. After executing the function, the grid is printed to the console, consisting of `h * w` characters, with `h - 1` blank lines separating the rows. The function does not return any value. An edge case to consider is when `h` or `w` is 1, which still adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 300\). In such cases, the grid will contain either a single row or a single column of alternating `#` and `.` characters. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly implements the described behavior.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
