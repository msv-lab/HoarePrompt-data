Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the chessboard generation logic as described in the problem statement. It uses the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` to alternate between `#` and `.` for each cell in the grid. The code handles all edge cases, including when `h` or `w` is 1. The output matches the expected pattern for various values of `h` and `w`, and the program correctly processes the input until `h` and `w` are both 0. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
