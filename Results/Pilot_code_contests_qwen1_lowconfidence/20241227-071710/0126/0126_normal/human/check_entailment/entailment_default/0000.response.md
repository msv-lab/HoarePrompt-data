Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly generates a chessboard pattern as described in the problem statement. It alternates between `#` and `.` based on the sum of the row index `i` and column index `j`. The condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` ensures that the pattern starts with `#` at the top-left corner, which is correct according to the problem description. Additionally, the code handles edge cases where `h` or `w` is 1, producing a single row or column of alternating `#` and `.` characters. The output format matches the expected format, and there are no missing functionalities or logical errors. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case within the given constraints.
