You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Draw a chessboard which has a height of H cm and a width of W cm. For example, the following figure shows a chessboard which has a height of 6 cm and a width of 10 cm.


.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#


Note that the top left corner should be drawn by '#'.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ H ≤ 300
* 1 ≤ W ≤ 300

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of two integers H and W separated by a single space.

The input ends with two 0 (when both H and W are zero).

Output

For each dataset, print the chessboard made of '#' and '.'.

Print a blank line after each dataset.

Example

Input

3 4
5 6
3 3

Program:
```
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
        print('')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
