Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly draw the chessboard pattern as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic `(i + j) % 2 == 0` will alternate between '#' and '.' in a checkerboard pattern, but it does not ensure that the top-left corner is always '#'. 

To illustrate, let's consider a simple case where `H = 2` and `W = 2`. According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
#.
.#
```

However, the current implementation would produce:

```
#. 
.#
```

This is because the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` makes the first row start with '#' and the second row start with '.', which is the reverse of what is required.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, specifically for the requirement that the top-left corner should be '#'.
