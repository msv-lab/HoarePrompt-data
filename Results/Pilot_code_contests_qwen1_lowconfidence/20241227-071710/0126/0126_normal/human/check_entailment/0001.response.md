Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `H` or `W` is odd correctly. Specifically, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` does not ensure that the top-left corner is always `'#'`. This is because for a board with odd dimensions, the top-left corner will sometimes be marked as `'.'` depending on the values of `i` and `j`.

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to consider only the row index `i` for determining whether to place a `'#'` or `'.'`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if i % 2 == 0 else '.', end='')
        print('')
```

In this corrected version, the condition `i % 2 == 0` ensures that the top-left corner is always `'#'`, and the rest of the pattern is correctly determined based on the row index.
