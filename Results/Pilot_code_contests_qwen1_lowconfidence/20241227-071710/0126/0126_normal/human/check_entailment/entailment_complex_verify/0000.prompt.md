You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Draw a chessboard which has a height of H cm and a width of W cm. For example, the following figure shows a chessboard which has a height of 6 cm and a width of 10 cm.


.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#
.#.#.#.#.
.#.#.#.#.#


Note that the top left corner should be drawn by '#'.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ H ≤ 300
* 1 ≤ W ≤ 300

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of two integers H and W separated by a single space.

The input ends with two 0 (when both H and W are zero).

Output

For each dataset, print the chessboard made of '#' and '.'.

Print a blank line after each dataset.

Example

Input

Program:
```
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
        print('')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly draw the chessboard pattern as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic `(i + j) % 2 == 0` will alternate between '#' and '.' in a checkerboard pattern, but it does not ensure that the top-left corner is always '#'. 

To illustrate, let's consider a simple case where `H = 2` and `W = 2`. According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
#.
.#
```

However, the current implementation would produce:

```
#. 
.#
```

This is because the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` makes the first row start with '#' and the second row start with '.', which is the reverse of what is required.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, specifically for the requirement that the top-left corner should be '#'.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
while True:
    (h, w) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if h == 0 and w == 0:
        break
    func_1(h, w)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: h and w are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 300 and 1 <= w <= 300.
def func_1(h, w):
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
        
        print('')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, the print statements have executed `h * w` times, printing `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` or `.` otherwise, and `h - 1` empty lines have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates and prints a grid of size `h` by `w` where each cell is either a `#` or a `.` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. Specifically, the cell is `#` if the sum of its row index `i` and column index `j` is even, and `.` if it is odd. After executing the function, the grid is printed to the console, consisting of `h * w` characters, with `h - 1` blank lines separating the rows. The function does not return any value. An edge case to consider is when `h` or `w` is 1, which still adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 300\). In such cases, the grid will contain either a single row or a single column of alternating `#` and `.` characters. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; it correctly implements the described behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
