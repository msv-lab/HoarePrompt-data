Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program does not guarantee the top-left corner to be '#'. Specifically, the logic `(i + j) % 2 == 0` alternates the characters based on the sum of the indices, which does not inherently ensure that the top-left corner (`i=0`, `j=0`) is always '#'. For example, if `H = 2` and `W = 2`, the output produced by the current logic is:

```
#. 
.#
```

which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for drawing a chessboard where the top-left corner must be '#', making the original assessment correct.
