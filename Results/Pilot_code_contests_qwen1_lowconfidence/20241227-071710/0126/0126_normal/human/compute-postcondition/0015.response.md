The code `print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')` checks if the sum of `i` and `j` is even or odd. Given that `i` is 2, let's denote the value of `j` as `j`. The condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` will determine whether to print `#` or `.`.

Since `i` is 2, `i + j` will be even if `j` is even, and odd if `j` is odd. However, the specific value of `j` is not provided. We know that the last print statement has printed `.`, which means `(i + j) % 2 != 0`, i.e., `i + j` is odd. Since `i` is 2, this implies that `j` must be odd.

The print statement does not affect the value of `i` or the fact that the print statements have executed `w + 3` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; no additional empty line has been printed. The current print statement has printed `.`, meaning the next one would print `#`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, the print statements have executed `w + 3` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; no additional empty line has been printed, the current print statement has printed `.`**
