The code calculates whether `(i + j)` is even or odd and prints `#` if it's even, otherwise prints `.`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `i` is defined as `w + 2`.
2. `j` is defined such that `j < w`.

The expression `(i + j) % 2` determines if `(i + j)` is even or odd:
- If `(i + j) % 2 == 0`, `#` is printed.
- Otherwise, `.` is printed.

Since the exact values of `w`, `i`, and `j` are not specified, let's represent them in terms of `w`:
- `i = w + 2`
- `j` is any value less than `w`.

Now, consider `(i + j) % 2`:
- `(i + j) = (w + 2) + j`
- Since `j` is less than `w`, `j` can take any value from `0` to `w-1`.

To determine if `(i + j)` is even or odd:
- If `j` is even, `(w + 2) + j` is even if `w` is even, and odd if `w` is odd.
- If `j` is odd, `(w + 2) + j` is even if `w` is odd, and odd if `w` is even.

In summary:
- If `w` is even, `(w + 2) + j` is even when `j` is even, and odd when `j` is odd.
- If `w` is odd, `(w + 2) + j` is even when `j` is odd, and odd when `j` is even.

Therefore, the output will be `#` if `(i + j)` is even, and `.` if `(i + j)` is odd.

Output State: **`w` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `w + 2`, `j` must be less than `w`, and the output is `#` if `(w + 2) + j` is even, otherwise `.`**
