Output State: **`i` is `w + 1`, the print statements have executed `2 * w + 1` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; no additional empty line has been printed, the current print statement has printed `.`**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `w` times, so if the loop executes `w` times, `i` will be `w + 1` because the loop starts with `j = 0` and `i` increments by 1 each time the loop runs.
- Each iteration of the loop prints either `#` or `.` depending on whether `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. Since `i` starts at 1, the pattern will alternate starting with `#` for `j = 0`, then `.` for `j = 1`, and so on.
- After `w` iterations, the loop will have printed `w` characters, which means a total of `2 * w` characters have been printed (since each character is printed twice: once as `#` and once as `.`). Additionally, an empty line is printed once after the loop completes, making the total print count `2 * w + 1`.
- Since the loop always prints one more time than the number of iterations, the last print statement will always print `.` if `w` is even and `#` if `w` is odd. However, since we need to cover all cases, we state that the current print statement has printed `.` (as the loop ends after printing `.`).

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `w + 1`, the print statements will have executed `2 * w + 1` times, and the current print statement will have printed `.`.
