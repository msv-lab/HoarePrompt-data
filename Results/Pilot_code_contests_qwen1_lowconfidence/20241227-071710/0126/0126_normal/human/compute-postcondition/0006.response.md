The code `print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')` checks if the sum of `i` and `j` is even or odd and prints either '#' or '.' based on that condition. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `w` must be greater than 2, we first evaluate `(i + j) % 2 == 0`. 

- The value of `i + j` is `0 + 2 = 2`.
- `2 % 2 == 0` is `True`, so the condition is satisfied, and `#` is printed.

No variables are assigned new values in this code snippet, only a print statement is executed. The output state includes the fact that the print statement has executed with the output being '#', and the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **the print statement has executed with the output being '#', `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `w` must be greater than 2**
