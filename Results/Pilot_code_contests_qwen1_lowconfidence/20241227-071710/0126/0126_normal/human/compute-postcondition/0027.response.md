Output State: **`i` is `h`, `j` is `w`, the print statements have executed `h * w` times, printing `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` or `.` otherwise, and `h - 1` empty lines have been printed.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables `i` and `j`:** 
  - `i` iterates from `0` to `h-1` inclusive.
  - `j` iterates from `0` to `w-1` inclusive.
  - After the loop completes, `i` will be `h-1` and `j` will be `w-1`.

- **Print Statements:**
  - The inner loop prints either `#` or `.` based on the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`.
  - The outer loop ensures that this process repeats for `h` rows.
  - Thus, the print statements execute `h * w` times in total.

- **Empty Lines:**
  - An empty line is printed after each row except the last one.
  - Since the outer loop runs `h` times, `h-1` empty lines are printed.

- **Initial Conditions:**
  - `h` and `w` are positive integers such that `1 <= h <= 300` and `1 <= w <= 300`.
  - The loop will run as long as `h` is a positive integer, so if `h` is zero, the loop does not execute at all, and `i` and `j` remain `0`.
