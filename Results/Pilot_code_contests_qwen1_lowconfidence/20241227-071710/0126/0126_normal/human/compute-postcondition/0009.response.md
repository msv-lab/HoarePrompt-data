Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `i` is 0.
   - The print statements have executed `w` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`.
   - An additional empty line has been printed.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as:
   ```
   for i in range(h):
   ```

3. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented and checked against the range `range(h)`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is still less than `h`.

6. **Print Statements**: Since the print statements have already executed `w` times and an additional empty line was printed, the same pattern (alternating `#` and `.`) will be followed in the next iteration unless otherwise specified.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 1.
- The print statements will have executed `w` times plus one more time (making it `w + 1` times), continuing the pattern of alternating `#` and `.`.
- An additional empty line will be printed.

State: **`i` is 1, the print statements have executed `w + 1` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; an additional empty line has been printed**.
