Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - The print statements have executed `w + 1` times.
   - An additional empty line has been printed.
   - The current print statement has printed `#`.

2. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(w)`.
   - This means `j` ranges from 0 to `w-1`.

3. **Current Iteration Analysis**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, it implies we are in the first iteration of the outer loop (if there is an outer loop).
   - The print statements have executed `w + 1` times so far.
   - An additional empty line has been printed.
   - The current print statement has printed `#`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must go from its current value to the next value within the range `range(w)`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` is in the range from 0 to `w-1`, and assuming `j` starts at 0 in each iteration of the outer loop, `j` needs to be 0 for the first iteration and then increase by 1 each time.
   - Given `i` is 1, it suggests we are in the second iteration of the outer loop.
   - Therefore, `j` should start from 0 in the current iteration, and the loop will execute for `j = 0` if `w > 0`.

6. **Final States**:
   - `i` remains 1 because the outer loop iteration count does not change within the inner loop.
   - The print statements will execute once more (`w + 1` becomes `w + 2`), and since it alternates between `#` and `.` and it printed `#` last, it will print `.` this time.
   - No additional empty line will be printed unless specified otherwise in the loop body.
   - The current print statement will print `.`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 1, the print statements have executed `w + 2` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; no additional empty line has been printed, the current print statement has printed `.`**
