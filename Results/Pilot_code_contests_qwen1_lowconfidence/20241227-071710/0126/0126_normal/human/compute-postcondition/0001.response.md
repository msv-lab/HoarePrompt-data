Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial values**: The loop is iterating over `j` using `range(w)`. This means `j` will take values from 0 to `w-1`.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `w` is at least 1. If `w` is 0, the loop will not execute because `range(0)` results in an empty sequence.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 300 (this state does not affect the loop execution).
   - `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 300. For the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0 (this state does not affect the loop execution).

Given these points, we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. 

So, the final state should include the following adjustments:
- `h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 300 (unchanged)
- `w` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0 (unchanged)

**State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 300, `w` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
