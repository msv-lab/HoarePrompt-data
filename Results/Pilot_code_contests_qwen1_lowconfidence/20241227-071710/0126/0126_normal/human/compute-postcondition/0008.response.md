The code `print('')` prints an empty line. This does not affect the values of any variables, but it does add an additional empty line to the output of the print statements. Therefore, the number of print statements that have executed remains the same, but each one now prints an additional empty line.

Output State: **`i` is 0, the print statements have executed `w` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; an additional empty line has been printed.**
