According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `w + 2`, and the output is determined by the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0`.

Since `i` is defined as `w + 2`, we need to consider how `j` changes and its relationship with `w` for the loop to continue.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `w` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `w + 2`.
- The loop outputs `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` or `.` otherwise.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be less than `w`.
- Since `j` increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
- Therefore, `j` must be `< w` at the start of the next iteration, which means `j + 1 < w` at the start of the current iteration.
- Additionally, `w` must still satisfy the condition `w >= 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `w` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` remains `w + 2`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from the previous value, so it must be less than `w`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`w` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `w + 2`, `j` must be less than `w`**.
