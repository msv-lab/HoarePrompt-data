According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the print statement has executed with `j` being unknown. This means that the loop has already started with `j` set to 0 and executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue (`j < w`) must still hold true.

State: **`i` is 0 and the print statement has executed with `j` being 1.**
