Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes.

### Initial State:
- `h` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\)
- `w` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq w \leq 300\)
- `i` is 0

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(w):
    print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### 1. Understanding the Loop:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(w)`, meaning it runs `w` times.
- Inside the loop, the condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` determines whether to print `#` or `.`.
- Since `i` starts at 0, let's consider the behavior for different values of `j`:
  - If `j` is even, `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is true, so `#` is printed.
  - If `j` is odd, `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is false, so `.` is printed.

#### 2. Output States for Few Iterations:
- After the loop executes 1 time (`j = 0`):
  - `i` remains 0
  - The print statement executes with `j` being 0, and since `(0 + 0) % 2 == 0`, `#` is printed.
- After the loop executes 2 times (`j = 0, 1`):
  - `i` remains 0
  - The print statement executes twice:
    - First iteration: `j = 0`, `(0 + 0) % 2 == 0`, so `#` is printed.
    - Second iteration: `j = 1`, `(0 + 1) % 2 == 1`, so `.` is printed.
- After the loop executes 3 times (`j = 0, 1, 2`):
  - `i` remains 0
  - The print statement executes three times:
    - First iteration: `j = 0`, `(0 + 0) % 2 == 0`, so `#` is printed.
    - Second iteration: `j = 1`, `(0 + 1) % 2 == 1`, so `.` is printed.
    - Third iteration: `j = 2`, `(0 + 2) % 2 == 0`, so `#` is printed.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- The loop will execute exactly `w` times.
- After each iteration, `i` remains 0 because the loop body does not modify `i`.
- The loop body prints either `#` or `.` based on the value of `j`.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop runs `w` times, and `i` remains unchanged at 0 throughout the loop, the final state of the variables after the loop completes is:
- `i` is 0
- The print statements will have executed exactly `w` times, printing alternating `#` and `.` depending on the value of `j`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`i` is 0, the print statements have executed `w` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`.**
