First, let's identify the initial values and conditions:

- `w` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `w + 2`.
- `j` must be less than `w - 1`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. Calculate the value of `i`:
   - Since `i = w + 2`, `i` is directly dependent on `w`.
   
2. The value of `j` remains unchanged and must be less than `w - 1`.

3. Evaluate the expression `(i + j) % 2`:
   - Substitute `i` with `w + 2`: The expression becomes `(w + 2 + j) % 2`.
   - This expression will determine whether the print statement outputs `'#'` or `'.'`.

Since `w` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is less than `w - 1`, we need to consider the parity of `(w + 2 + j)`.

- If `w` is odd, then `w + 2` is odd, and adding `j` (which is less than `w - 1`, and thus less than an even number if `w` is odd, making `j` also odd) results in an even sum.
- If `w` is even, then `w + 2` is even, and adding `j` (which is less than `w - 1`, and thus less than an odd number if `w` is even, making `j` also even) results in an even sum.

In both cases, the sum `(w + 2 + j)` is even, so `(w + 2 + j) % 2 == 0` is true.

Therefore, the code will print `'#'`.

Output State: **`w` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `w + 2`, `j` must be less than `w - 1`, and the output is `'#'`.**
