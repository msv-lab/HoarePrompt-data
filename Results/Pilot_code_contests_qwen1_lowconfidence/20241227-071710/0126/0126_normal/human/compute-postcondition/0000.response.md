According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `h`. The loop will execute if `h` is at least 1. Given the constraints that `1 <= h <= 300` and `1 <= w <= 300`, we know that `h` must be a positive integer within this range. Before the loop starts, `i` is typically set to 0 by default in the `range()` function.

To ensure the loop executes, `h` must be greater than 0 (which is already guaranteed by the constraint `1 <= h <= 300`). Additionally, `i` must start at 0, as the `range(h)` function generates values from 0 up to but not including `h`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these requirements:

State: **`h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 300, `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 300, `i` is 0**
