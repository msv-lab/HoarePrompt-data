The code `print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')` checks if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is true. Since `i` is initially 1 and `j` is not defined in the initial state, let's assume `j` is also 1 for the purpose of this calculation (as it is not specified otherwise).

- If `(i + j) % 2 == 0`, then `print('#')`.
- If `(i + j) % 2 != 0`, then `print('.')`.

Here, `(i + j) = (1 + 1) = 2`, and `2 % 2 == 0` is true. So, the code will print `'#'`.

The print statement itself does not modify any variables, it only prints a character based on the condition. The number of times the print statement has executed (`w + 1`) and the fact that an additional empty line was printed are part of the precondition and remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, the print statements have executed `w + 1` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; an additional empty line has been printed, the current print statement has printed `#`.**
