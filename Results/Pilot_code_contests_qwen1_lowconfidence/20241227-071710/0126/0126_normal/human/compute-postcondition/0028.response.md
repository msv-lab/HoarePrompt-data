The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `h` and `w`. Both `h` and `w` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 300\). The function returns a value based on the constraints provided. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `h` and `w`, both being positive integers within the specified range, and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `h` and `w`, both positive integers such that \(1 \leq h \leq 300\) and \(1 \leq w \leq 300\), and returns a value based on these inputs.**
