The code `print('')` simply prints an empty line. This does not affect the values of any variables. The loop that executed `w` times, printing `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` or `.` otherwise, is also completed, but its impact is already reflected in the previous state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the loop and print statements have been executed.

Output State: **`w` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `w + 2`, `j` is `w`, and the loop has executed `w` times, printing `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` or `.` otherwise, and an empty line has been printed.**
