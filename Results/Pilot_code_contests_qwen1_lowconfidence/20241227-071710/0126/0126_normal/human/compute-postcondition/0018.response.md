According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `h`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `h`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `w + 1`.
- The print statements have executed `2 * w + 2` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`.
- No additional empty line has been printed before.
- The current print statement has printed an empty line.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes `w + 2`.
- Since the print statements alternate between `#` and `.`, the next print statement will print either `#` or `.` depending on the pattern established by the previous prints.
- An additional empty line will be printed after this print statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `w + 2`, the print statements have executed `2 * w + 4` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; an additional empty line has been printed before.**
