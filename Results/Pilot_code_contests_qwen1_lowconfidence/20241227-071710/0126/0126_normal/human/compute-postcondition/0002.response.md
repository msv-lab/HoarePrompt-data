The code prints `'#'` if `(i + j)` is even and `'. '` if `(i + j)` is odd. However, the initial state does not specify a value for `j`. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state and is not updated by the code, its value remains unknown. The only variables affected are `i` and the print statement itself. 

- Initially, `i` is 0.
- The code does not update `i`, so `i` remains 0.
- The print statement depends on `j`, which is unknown.

Since the print statement does not store its output in any variable and just prints it, the output state will include the fact that `i` is 0 and the print statement has executed.

Output State: **`i` is 0 and the print statement has executed with `j` being unknown.**
