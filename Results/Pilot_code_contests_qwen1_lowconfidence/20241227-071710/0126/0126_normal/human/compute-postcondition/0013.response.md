The code updates the value of `i` and checks if `(i + j)` is even or odd to determine what to print. Since the current print statement has printed `.`, this implies the previous print statement printed `#`. Given that the prints alternate between `#` and `.` and considering the current state, let's analyze the impact:

1. The condition `(i + j) % 2 == 0` was false in the last print statement, meaning `i + j` was odd, which printed `.`.
2. Now, we need to determine the value of `j` and whether `(i + j)` is even or odd for the current print statement.

Since `i` is initially 1 and assuming `j` hasn't been modified, let's consider the following:
- If `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is true for the current print statement, it will print `#`.
- If `(i + j) % 2 == 1` is true for the current print statement, it will print `.`.

Given that the last print statement printed `.` and we are now checking `(i + j) % 2 == 0` for the current print statement, let's deduce the value of `j`:
- For the last print statement, `(1 + j) % 2 == 1`, implying `j` is even (e.g., `j = 0, 2, 4, ...`).
- For the current print statement, `(1 + j) % 2 == 0`, implying `j` should be odd (e.g., `j = 1, 3, 5, ...`).

Since the exact value of `j` isn't specified, we can generalize that it has been updated to an odd number to satisfy the condition for printing `#`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (since the print statement has executed and likely moved to the next iteration).
- The print statement will print `#` because `(1 + j) % 2 == 0`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, the print statements have executed `w + 2` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; no additional empty line has been printed, the current print statement has printed `#`.**
