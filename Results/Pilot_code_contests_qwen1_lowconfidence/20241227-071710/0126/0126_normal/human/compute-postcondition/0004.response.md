The code checks if `(i + j) % 2` is equal to 0. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, we calculate `(i + j) % 2` which is `(0 + 1) % 2` or `1 % 2`, which equals 1. Since this is not equal to 0, the condition is false, and the `else` part of the conditional expression is executed, printing `'.'`. No variables are updated by this code, only a value is printed.

Output State: **the print statement has executed with the output being '.', `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
