The code `print('#' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '.')` depends on the value of `j`. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state, its value is unknown. The value of `i` is known as `w + 2`, but without knowing the value of `j`, we cannot determine whether `(i + j) % 2 == 0` is true or false. However, we can say that the output will be either `#` or `.` depending on the parity of the sum `i + j`.

The initial conditions for `w` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `w + 2`; the output will be `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` or `.` otherwise.

Output State: **`w` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `w + 2`; the output will be `#` if `(i + j) % 2 == 0` or `.` otherwise.**
