The `print('')` statement adds an empty line to the output. This affects the count of print statements, which was previously `2 * w + 1` times, and now an additional empty line has been printed. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was defined as `w + 1` before the print statement and is not affected by the print statement itself.

Output State: **`i` is `w + 1`, the print statements have executed `2 * w + 2` times, printing alternating `#` and `.`; no additional empty line has been printed before, the current print statement has printed an empty line.**
