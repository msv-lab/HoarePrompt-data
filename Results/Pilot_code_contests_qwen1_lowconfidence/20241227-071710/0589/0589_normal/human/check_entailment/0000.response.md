Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is intended to find three distinct numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(l \leq a < b < c \leq r\), pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, c)\) are coprime, and pair \((a, c)\) is not coprime. However, the implementation has a logical flaw.

The function `func_6` iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given range and checks if they satisfy the conditions. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(b\) and \(r\) is 1 and the GCD of \(b\) and \(a\) is not 1, it returns the triplet \((a, b, r)\). This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the triplet will always exist for the given range. Specifically, the function does not account for the possibility that no such triplet might exist within the given constraints.

For example, consider the input \(l = 2\) and \(r = 4\). The function returns \((2, 3, 4)\) as a valid triplet. However, let's verify this:
- GCD of \(2\) and \(3\) is \(1\).
- GCD of \(3\) and \(4\) is \(1\).
- GCD of \(2\) and \(4\) is \(2\).

This triplet satisfies the conditions, but the program logic itself is flawed because it does not handle the case where no valid triplet exists. For instance, if we take \(l = 10\) and \(r = 11\), there is no valid triplet, and the program should return \(-1\), but it returns \((10, 11, 11)\) which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required logic in all cases, making it incorrect.
