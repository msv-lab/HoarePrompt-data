Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in the following points:

1. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_5`:**
   - The function `func_5` is intended to check if two numbers are coprime. However, the logic implemented in `func_5` is incorrect. It performs the Euclidean algorithm incorrectly. The Euclidean algorithm should continue until `a % b` becomes 0, and the last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor (GCD). Here, it incorrectly sets `a` to `b` and `b` to `c` in each iteration, which does not achieve the desired result.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_6`:**
   - The function `func_6` is intended to find a counterexample where the pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, but (a, c) is not. However, due to the incorrect implementation of `func_5`, the function `func_6` may not correctly identify such triples (a, b, c).

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, let's consider an example:

#### Example:
For input:
```
2 4
```

The expected output is:
```
2 3 4
```

However, due to the incorrect implementation of `func_5`, the program will not correctly identify this as a valid counterexample. Instead, it might fail to find a valid triple or incorrectly identify non-counterexamples.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

# Function 1: Read a single integer from input
def func_1():
    return int(input())

# Function 2: Read two integers separated by space
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

# Function 3: Not used in this context
def func_3():
    pass

# Function 4: Not used in this context
def func_4():
    pass

# Function 5: Check if two numbers are coprime
def func_5(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1

# Function 6: Find a counterexample
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r):
        for b in range(a + 1, r):
            if func_5(a, b) and func_5(b, r) and not func_5(a, r):
                return a, b, r
    return -1, -1, -1

# Main function to read input and output the result
def main():
    (l, r) = func_2()
    if func_5(r, l) == 1:
        (a, b, c) = func_6(l, r)
        if a == -1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(a, b, c)
    else:
        print(l, l + 1, r)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version:

1. **Importing `math.gcd`**: We use the built-in `math.gcd` function to correctly compute the GCD of two numbers.
2. **Function `func_5`**: Correctly checks if two numbers are coprime using `math.gcd`.
3. **Function `func_6`**: Iterates over possible values of `a` and `b` to find a valid counterexample. The logic ensures that (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, but (a, c) is not.
4. **Main Function**: Reads the input and prints the result based on the logic.

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies valid counterexamples as per the problem description.
