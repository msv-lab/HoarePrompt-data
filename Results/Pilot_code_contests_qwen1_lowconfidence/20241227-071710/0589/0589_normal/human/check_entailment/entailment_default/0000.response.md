Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find three distinct numbers (a, b, c) such that (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, but (a, c) is not. The function `func_5` is incorrectly implemented, as it always returns 0 instead of the GCD of the two numbers. This means that `func_5(r, b) == 1` is always false and `func_5(b, a) != 1` is always true, leading to the function `func_6` returning invalid results.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

For the input range `l = 2` and `r = 4`, the function `func_6(2, 4)` should ideally find a valid triplet (a, b, c). However, due to the incorrect implementation of `func_5`, the function will always return `(-1, -1, -1)` because `func_5(r, b) == 1` will never be true. Thus, the program does not work as expected for every potential case.
