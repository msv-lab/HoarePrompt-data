Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly find a counterexample for the given problem description. Specifically, the function `func_6` attempts to find three numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(l \leq a < b < c \leq r\), where \((a, b)\) and \((b, c)\) are coprime but \((a, c)\) is not. However, the logic within the nested loops is flawed.

The issue lies in the condition `func_5(b, a) != 1`. This checks if \(b\) and \(a\) are not coprime, which is incorrect. Instead, we need to check if \(a\) and \(c\) are not coprime. Additionally, the function returns a tuple \((-1, -1, -1)\) if no valid triplets are found, which is fine. However, the main logic needs to correctly identify the conditions for coprimality.

A correct approach would involve checking the gcd (greatest common divisor) of \(a\) and \(c\) and ensuring that the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) and \(b\) and \(c\) is 1, but \(a\) and \(c\) share a common factor greater than 1. The current implementation does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
