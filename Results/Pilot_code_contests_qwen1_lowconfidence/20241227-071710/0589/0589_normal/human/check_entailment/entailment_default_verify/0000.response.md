Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic is flawed because it does not guarantee that a valid triplet \((a, b, c)\) will always be found, even though such triplets may exist. The function `func_6` does not handle the case where no valid triplets exist within the given constraints, as demonstrated by the example inputs \(l = 10\) and \(r = 11\). In this case, the function incorrectly returns \((10, 11, 11)\) instead of \(-1\), which is the correct output when no valid triplet can be formed. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
