Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to find a counterexample for the statement. Specifically, the function `func_5` incorrectly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) and always returns 0, which is not the intended behavior. Additionally, the function `func_6` has several issues:

1. **Incorrect GCD Calculation**: The function `func_5` uses the Euclidean algorithm incorrectly. It should return the GCD of the two numbers, but it incorrectly sets `a` to `b` and `b` to `c` in each iteration, leading to an incorrect result.

2. **Invalid Return Values**: The function `func_6` returns `-1, -1, -1` if no valid `a` and `b` are found. However, it does not correctly check the conditions for finding a counterexample. Specifically, it does not ensure that `func_5(b, a) != 1` and `func_5(r, b) == 1`.

To illustrate a specific case where the code does not work correctly:

Consider the input range `l = 1` and `r = 4`. According to the problem description, we need to find three distinct numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that:
- `l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r`
- Pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, c)` are coprime
- Pair `(a, c)` is not coprime

For the range `1` to `4`, one valid counterexample would be `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 4`. Here:
- Pair `(1, 2)` is coprime (GCD = 1)
- Pair `(2, 4)` is coprime (GCD = 2, but we need it to be coprime)
- Pair `(1, 4)` is not coprime (GCD = 1)

However, the provided code will not correctly identify this counterexample because `func_5` returns 0 for all pairs, and `func_6` will not find a valid `a` and `b` that satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find a counterexample for the given problem.
