You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Your friend has recently learned about coprime numbers. A pair of numbers {a, b} is called coprime if the maximum number that divides both a and b is equal to one. 

Your friend often comes up with different statements. He has recently supposed that if the pair (a, b) is coprime and the pair (b, c) is coprime, then the pair (a, c) is coprime. 

You want to find a counterexample for your friend's statement. Therefore, your task is to find three distinct numbers (a, b, c), for which the statement is false, and the numbers meet the condition l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r. 

More specifically, you need to find three numbers (a, b, c), such that l ≤ a < b < c ≤ r, pairs (a, b) and (b, c) are coprime, and pair (a, c) is not coprime.

Input

The single line contains two positive space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018; r - l ≤ 50).

Output

Print three positive space-separated integers a, b, c — three distinct numbers (a, b, c) that form the counterexample. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. The numbers must be printed in ascending order. 

If the counterexample does not exist, print the single number -1.

Examples

Input

2 4


Output

2 3 4


Input

10 11


Output

-1


Input

900000000000000009 900000000000000029


Output

900000000000000009 900000000000000010 900000000000000021

Note

In the first sample pair (2, 4) is not coprime and pairs (2, 3) and (3, 4) are. 

In the second sample you cannot form a group of three distinct integers, so the answer is -1. 

In the third sample it is easy to see that numbers 900000000000000009 and 900000000000000021 are divisible by three.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 <= l <= r and r - l <= 50.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user within the range [l, r]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and ensures that the input is within the range `[l, r]`. If the user inputs a value outside this range, the function will continue to prompt the user until a valid input is received. After a valid input is obtained, the function returns this integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from user input split by spaces, where the length of the list is between 1 and 51 inclusive, and each element is within the range [l, r]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts user input as a string, splits it into integers using whitespace as delimiters, and returns a list of these integers. The length of the returned list is between 1 and 51 inclusive, and each element in the list is an integer within the range [l, r], where l and r are predefined integers satisfying 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50. There are no additional checks or transformations applied to the input values beyond converting them to integers and ensuring they fall within the specified range.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of digits, and its length is at least 3.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s)])
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string 's', starting from the beginning and including all characters up to the full length of 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` takes no explicit parameters and prompts the user to input a string `s` consisting of digits. It then returns a list containing all characters from the input string `s`. The function ensures that the entire input string is included in the returned list, regardless of its length (which must be at least 3 characters). There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code. However, it should be mentioned that the function does not validate whether the input string contains only digits, which could be an important consideration depending on the intended use case.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object created from converting the input split by spaces into integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. The function assumes that the input is formatted correctly and consists only of integers separated by spaces. If the input is not properly formatted (e.g., contains non-integer values or is empty), the function will still attempt to convert the input but will produce a map object with invalid elements. There are no explicit checks for edge cases such as empty input or non-integer values in the input string.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a > 0 and b > 0, and a ≠ b.
def func_5(a, b):
    while a % b > 0:
        c = a % b
        
        a = b
        
        b = c
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is 0
    return b
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where `a > 0`, `b > 0`, and `a ≠ b`. It repeatedly updates `a` and `b` using the modulus operation until `a` is divisible by `b` without a remainder. After the loop, it returns the value of `b`. However, due to the annotations being incomplete, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` should be reconsidered. In reality, `a` will be equal to `b`, and `c` will hold the original remainder of `a % b`. Since the loop terminates when `a` is divisible by `b`, the returned value of `b` is effectively the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`. The function always returns 0, which is incorrect given the intended logic.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return a, b, r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is `r + 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`. If the loop does not execute, then `a` remains `r + 1`, `b` remains the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` remains unchanged.
    return -1, -1, -1
    #`The program returns -1, -1, -1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). It searches for integers `a` and `b` within the range `[l, r-1]` that satisfy specific conditions involving the function `func_5`. If such integers `a` and `b` are found, the function returns them along with the value of `r`. If no valid `a` and `b` are found, the function returns `-1, -1, -1`.

1. The function iterates over pairs `(a, b)` where `a` ranges from `l` to `r` and `b` ranges from `a + 1` to `r`.
2. For each pair, it checks if `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
3. If the conditions are met, the function immediately returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
4. If no such `a` and `b` are found after checking all possible pairs, the function returns `-1, -1, -1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:

- The code does not handle the case where no valid `a` and `b` are found within the loop. However, the annotations suggest that the loop will always find a valid pair under certain conditions, which might be an oversight in the current implementation.
- The function does not explicitly check if `func_5(r, b + 1) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b + 1, a) == 1` when no valid `a` and `b` are found. This condition is included in the return postconditions, indicating that it might be necessary for handling certain edge cases.
- The function does not return additional information about the specific conditions under which it fails to find valid `a` and `b`. For example, it does not distinguish between the case where no valid `a` and `b` are found and the case where `func_5(r, b + 1) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b + 1, a) == 1` holds true.

After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows:
- If valid `a` and `b` are found, the program returns `a`, `b`, and `r` with `a` in the range `[l, r-1]`, `b` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` as given.
- If no valid `a` and `b` are found, the program returns `-1, -1, -1`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
