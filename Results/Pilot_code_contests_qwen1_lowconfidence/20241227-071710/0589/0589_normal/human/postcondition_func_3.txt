The function `func_4()` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. The function assumes that the input is formatted correctly and consists only of integers separated by spaces. If the input is not properly formatted (e.g., contains non-integer values or is empty), the function will still attempt to convert the input but will produce a map object with invalid elements. There are no explicit checks for edge cases such as empty input or non-integer values in the input string.
