#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 <= l <= r and r - l <= 50.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user within the range [l, r]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer input from the user and ensures that the input is within the range `[l, r]`. If the user inputs a value outside this range, the function will continue to prompt the user until a valid input is received. After a valid input is obtained, the function returns this integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from user input split by spaces, where the length of the list is between 1 and 51 inclusive, and each element is within the range [l, r]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2()` accepts user input as a string, splits it into integers using whitespace as delimiters, and returns a list of these integers. The length of the returned list is between 1 and 51 inclusive, and each element in the list is an integer within the range [l, r], where l and r are predefined integers satisfying 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50. There are no additional checks or transformations applied to the input values beyond converting them to integers and ensuring they fall within the specified range.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of digits, and its length is at least 3.
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s)])
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string 's', starting from the beginning and including all characters up to the full length of 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` takes no explicit parameters and prompts the user to input a string `s` consisting of digits. It then returns a list containing all characters from the input string `s`. The function ensures that the entire input string is included in the returned list, regardless of its length (which must be at least 3 characters). There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code. However, it should be mentioned that the function does not validate whether the input string contains only digits, which could be an important consideration depending on the intended use case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_4():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object created from converting the input split by spaces into integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. The function assumes that the input is formatted correctly and consists only of integers separated by spaces. If the input is not properly formatted (e.g., contains non-integer values or is empty), the function will still attempt to convert the input but will produce a map object with invalid elements. There are no explicit checks for edge cases such as empty input or non-integer values in the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a > 0 and b > 0, and a ≠ b.
def func_5(a, b):
    while a % b > 0:
        c = a % b
        
        a = b
        
        b = c
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is 0
    return b
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where `a > 0`, `b > 0`, and `a ≠ b`. It repeatedly updates `a` and `b` using the modulus operation until `a` is divisible by `b` without a remainder. After the loop, it returns the value of `b`. However, due to the annotations being incomplete, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` should be reconsidered. In reality, `a` will be equal to `b`, and `c` will hold the original remainder of `a % b`. Since the loop terminates when `a` is divisible by `b`, the returned value of `b` is effectively the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`. The function always returns 0, which is incorrect given the intended logic.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18 and r - l ≤ 50.
def func_6(l, r):
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
            if func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1:
                return a, b, r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is `r + 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`. If the loop does not execute, then `a` remains `r + 1`, `b` remains the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` remains unchanged.
    return -1, -1, -1
    #`The program returns -1, -1, -1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). It searches for integers `a` and `b` within the range `[l, r-1]` that satisfy specific conditions involving the function `func_5`. If such integers `a` and `b` are found, the function returns them along with the value of `r`. If no valid `a` and `b` are found, the function returns `-1, -1, -1`.

1. The function iterates over pairs `(a, b)` where `a` ranges from `l` to `r` and `b` ranges from `a + 1` to `r`.
2. For each pair, it checks if `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
3. If the conditions are met, the function immediately returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
4. If no such `a` and `b` are found after checking all possible pairs, the function returns `-1, -1, -1`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:

- The code does not handle the case where no valid `a` and `b` are found within the loop. However, the annotations suggest that the loop will always find a valid pair under certain conditions, which might be an oversight in the current implementation.
- The function does not explicitly check if `func_5(r, b + 1) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b + 1, a) == 1` when no valid `a` and `b` are found. This condition is included in the return postconditions, indicating that it might be necessary for handling certain edge cases.
- The function does not return additional information about the specific conditions under which it fails to find valid `a` and `b`. For example, it does not distinguish between the case where no valid `a` and `b` are found and the case where `func_5(r, b + 1) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b + 1, a) == 1` holds true.

After the function concludes, the state of the program is as follows:
- If valid `a` and `b` are found, the program returns `a`, `b`, and `r` with `a` in the range `[l, r-1]`, `b` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` as given.
- If no valid `a` and `b` are found, the program returns `-1, -1, -1`.
