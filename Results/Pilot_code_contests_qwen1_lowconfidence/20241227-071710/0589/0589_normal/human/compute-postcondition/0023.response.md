Output State: **`a` is `r`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50` and no `b` in the range `[r+1, r]` satisfies `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. If no such `b` exists, `a` remains `r`, `b` remains undefined, and `r` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Conditions:** The loop starts with `a = r` and checks for the existence of a `b` in the range `[r+1, r]` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. If such a `b` is found, the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`. This process continues until a suitable `b` is found or the loop completes without finding one.
  
- **After Loop Execution:** After executing the loop for all possible values of `b` in the range `[r+1, r]`, the following scenarios arise:
  - If a suitable `b` is found, the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`. Here, `a` remains `r`, `b` becomes the smallest integer greater than `r` that satisfies the conditions, and `r` remains unchanged.
  - If no such `b` is found, the loop does not return anything, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `r` remain as they were initially: `a = r`, `b` is undefined (since no valid `b` was found), and `r` remains unchanged.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop finishes executing all iterations is as described above.
