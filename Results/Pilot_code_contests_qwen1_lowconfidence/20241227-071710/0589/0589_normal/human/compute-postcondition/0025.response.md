To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a = r + 1`
   - `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`
   - `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(a + 1, r + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

### Analysis:

- The for loop iterates over integers from `a + 1` to `r + 1`.
- For the loop to start executing, the starting value of `b` (which is the initial value of the loop variable `b`) must be within this range.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Condition for `b`:**
   - `b` must be the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
   - This means that `b` must be the smallest integer greater than `r` that satisfies these two conditions.

2. **Range Condition:**
   - The loop starts when `b` is set to its initial value and checks if `b` is within the range `[a + 1, r + 1]`.

Given that `a = r + 1`, the range for the loop is from `r + 2` to `r + 1`, which simplifies to just one value, `r + 2`, since `r + 1` is `a` and the loop starts at `a + 1`.

### Conclusion:

For the loop to start executing, `b` must be the smallest integer greater than `r` that satisfies the given conditions, and it must fall within the range `[a + 1, r + 1]`. Since `a = r + 1`, the only possible value for `b` within the range would be `r + 2`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts must include:

- `a` is `r + 1`
- `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1` (which should be `r + 2`)
- `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`

### Final State:

State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is `r + 2`, `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`**
