You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `l` is an integer
   - `r` is an integer
   - \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\)
   - \(r - l \leq 50\)
   - `a` is `r`
   - There exists at least one `b` within the range \([r+1, r]\) such that either `func_5(r, b) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b, r) == 1`.

2. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop runs from `b = a + 1` to `b = r`.
   - For the loop to execute, `a + 1` must be less than or equal to `r`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - Since `a` is `r`, the loop will run from `b = r + 1` to `r`. This means that `r + 1` must be greater than `r`, which is inherently true (since `r + 1 > r`).
   - Therefore, the primary condition is that `r + 1` must be in the range where there exists at least one `b` such that either `func_5(r, b) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b, r) == 1`.

4. **Summary of States to Adjust**:
   - We need to ensure that the initial conditions are met, particularly the existence of `b` satisfying the given functional condition.

Given these points, we can summarize the required states as follows:

**State**: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\), \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` is `r`, and there exists at least one `b` within the range \([r+1, r]\) such that either `func_5(r, b) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b, r) == 1`**.
if condition:
```
if (func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else.
