Output State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\), \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` is within the range \([l, r-1]\), and there exists at least one `b` within the range \([a+1, r]\) such that either `func_5(r, b) â‰  1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`. If no such `b` is found, the function returns nothing.**
