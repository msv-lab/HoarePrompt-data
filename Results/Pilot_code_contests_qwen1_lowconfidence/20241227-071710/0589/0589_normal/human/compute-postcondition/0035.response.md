Output State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`. If the loop does not execute, then `a` remains `r + 1`, `b` remains the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` remains unchanged. If the loop executes, the loop will find such a `b` and return `a`, `b`, and `r`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** `a = r + 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` satisfying the conditions `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`.
- **Loop Execution:** The loop continues to increment `b` until it finds a value that satisfies both conditions `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. Once such a `b` is found, the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
- **Final Output State:** If the loop does not execute (i.e., no suitable `b` is found within the range), the original values of `a`, `b`, and `r` are maintained. If the loop does execute, it will return the values of `a`, `b`, and `r` immediately, as the loop exits upon finding a valid `b`.

Thus, the final output state is determined by whether the loop executes or not, but in both cases, `a` is initially set to `r + 1` and `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` that meets the specified conditions.
