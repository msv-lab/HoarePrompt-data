Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `l` is an integer
   - `r` is an integer
   - \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\)
   - \(r - l \leq 50\)
   - `a` is `r`
   - There exists at least one `b` within the range \([r+1, r]\) such that either `func_5(r, b) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b, r) == 1`.

2. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The loop runs from `b = a + 1` to `b = r`.
   - For the loop to execute, `a + 1` must be less than or equal to `r`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - Since `a` is `r`, the loop will run from `b = r + 1` to `r`. This means that `r + 1` must be greater than `r`, which is inherently true (since `r + 1 > r`).
   - Therefore, the primary condition is that `r + 1` must be in the range where there exists at least one `b` such that either `func_5(r, b) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b, r) == 1`.

4. **Summary of States to Adjust**:
   - We need to ensure that the initial conditions are met, particularly the existence of `b` satisfying the given functional condition.

Given these points, we can summarize the required states as follows:

**State**: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\), \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` is `r`, and there exists at least one `b` within the range \([r+1, r]\) such that either `func_5(r, b) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b, r) == 1`**.
