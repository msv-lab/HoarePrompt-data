Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is `r + 1`
   - `b` is `r + 3`
   - `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from `a + 1` up to `r`.

3. **Current Values Before the Next Iteration:**
   - `a` remains `r + 1`.
   - `b` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `b` each time it runs).
   - `r` remains the same.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `b < r + 1`.

Given the current values:
- `a` is `r + 1`
- `b` is `r + 3`
- `r` is unchanged

For the loop to continue executing:
- `b` must be less than `r + 1`. However, since `b` starts at `r + 3` and increases by 1 each iteration, it will never be less than `r + 1`.

Since `b` is already set to `r + 3`, it cannot be incremented further to satisfy the loop condition `b < r + 1`.

Therefore, the loop will not execute any more times based on the given conditions.

However, if we were to consider the hypothetical next iteration and the necessary adjustments:

- `a` would remain `r + 1`.
- `b` would be incremented to `r + 4`.
- `r` would remain unchanged.

So, the final answer considering the hypothetical next iteration would be:

State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is `r + 4`, `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`**
