According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a` and the range defined by `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over all integers from `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is within the range \([l, r-1]\), and there exists at least one `b` within the range \([a+1, r]\) such that either `func_5(r, b) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be the next value in the range, which would be `r`. Additionally, since the condition involving `b` must still hold true for the new value of `a`, we need to ensure that there is still at least one `b` within the updated range \([a+1, r]\) satisfying the given condition.

Given these conditions, let's adjust the states:

1. The value of `a` needs to be updated to `r`.
2. We need to ensure that there is still at least one `b` within the range \([a+1, r]\) (which is now \([r+1, r]\)) that satisfies the condition. Since this range is empty, we must verify if such a `b` exists.

If such a `b` does not exist, the function will return nothing, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, we need to ensure that there is at least one `b` in the new range to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\), \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` is `r`, and there exists at least one `b` within the range \([r+1, r]\) such that either `func_5(r, b) ≠ 1` or `func_5(b, r) == 1`.**
