The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`. Both `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\).

Based on the described cases, the function returns different sets of values depending on specific conditions involving the function `func_5` and the integers `a` and `b` within the range `[l, r]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, both integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\), and returns a, b, and r based on specific conditions involving the function `func_5` and integers a and b within the range [l, r].**
