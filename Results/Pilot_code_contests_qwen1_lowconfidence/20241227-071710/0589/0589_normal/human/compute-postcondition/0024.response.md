To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given conditions and the behavior of the loop.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `a` is `r`.
  - `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
  - `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`.
  - No `b` in the range `[r+1, r]` satisfies `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop iterates over `a` in the range `l` to `r + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `a` starts as `r` at the beginning of the first iteration.
   - The loop then increments `a` by 1 in each subsequent iteration.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must increment to a new value.
   - Since `a` starts as `r`, the next value of `a` will be `r + 1`.

3. **Values of `b` and `r`**:
   - The values of `b` and `r` remain unchanged as long as no valid `b` is found in the range `[r+1, r]`.
   - Since no such `b` exists in the previous iteration, they will remain the same.

### Updated State:
- `a` will be incremented to `r + 1`.
- `b` remains the same (smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`).
- `r` remains the same.

### Conclusion:
State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`**.
