Output State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`. If the loop does not execute, then `a` remains `r + 1`, `b` remains the smallest integer greater than `r` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`, and `r` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop searches for `a` and `b` within the range `[l, r + 1]` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.
- If such a pair `(a, b)` is found, the loop returns `a`, `b`, and `r`.
- If no such pair is found, the loop continues until it exhausts all possible pairs in the specified range.
- After the loop completes all its iterations, the following conditions will hold:
  - `a` will be `r + 1` because the loop increments `a` starting from `l` up to `r`.
  - `b` will be the smallest integer greater than `r` that satisfies the condition `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. If no such `b` is found, `b` will remain undefined.
  - `r` will remain within the constraint `r - l <= 50`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variables `a`, `b`, and `r` will have the described final values, with `a` being `r + 1` and `b` being the smallest integer greater than `r` satisfying the given conditions, or remaining undefined if no such `b` is found.
