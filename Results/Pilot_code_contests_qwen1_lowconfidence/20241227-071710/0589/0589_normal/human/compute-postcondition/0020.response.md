According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b` and its relationship with `a` and `r`. At the end of the last iteration:

- `a` is `r`.
- `b` is `a + 2`.
- `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50` and no `b` exists in `[r+1, r]` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.

The loop iterates over `b` in the range from `a + 1` to `r + 1`. For the loop to continue, `b` must be within this range.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `b` is `a + 2`.
- Therefore, `b` is already at the next possible value in the range.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1 to become `a + 3`. Additionally, `r` must still satisfy the condition `r - l <= 50` and no `b` should exist in `[r+1, r]` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.

State: **`a` is `r`, `b` is `a + 3`, and `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50` and no `b` exists in `[r+1, r]` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`.**
