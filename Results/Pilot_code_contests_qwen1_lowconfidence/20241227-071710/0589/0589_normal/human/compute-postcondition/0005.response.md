According to the given code and the conditions provided:

1. The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from `a + 1` up to `r`.
2. The initial conditions are:
   - `l` is an integer.
   - `r` is an integer, with \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\).
   - \(r - l \leq 50\).
   - `a` must be within the range \([l, r-1]\).
   - Either \(func_5(r, b) \neq 1\) or \(func_5(b, a) == 1\).

For the loop to execute one more time:

- The value of `b` must start from `a + 1` and increase by 1 each iteration.
- Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `b` was one value less than what it should be for the next iteration.
- Hence, if `b` was `a + k` at the end of the last iteration, then `b` should start as `a + k + 1` in the next iteration.

Since we don't know the exact value of `b` at the end of the last iteration, we can represent it as `b_end` where `b_end = a + k` for some integer `k`. For the loop to continue, `b` should be `a + k + 1`.

Given that the loop condition also includes the function checks (`func_5(r, b) \neq 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`), these conditions must still hold true for the new value of `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\), \(r - l \leq 50\), `a` must be within the range \([l, r-1]\), and either \(func_5(r, b + 1) \neq 1\) or \(func_5(b + 1, a) == 1\)**
