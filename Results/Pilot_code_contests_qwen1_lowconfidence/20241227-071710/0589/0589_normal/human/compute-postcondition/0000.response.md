According to the given for loop statement, the loop will execute as long as the condition `l ≤ a ≤ r` holds true. Specifically, the loop will iterate over all integer values from `l` to `r` inclusive.

Given the initial states:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\)
- The difference between `r` and `l` is at most 50 (\(r - l \leq 50\))

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. `l` should be an integer.
2. `r` should be an integer.
3. \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) should hold.
4. \(r - l \leq 50\) should hold.

Since the problem does not specify any initial values for `l` and `r`, we assume the simplest valid case where the loop can start executing immediately. The simplest valid scenario would be when both `l` and `r` are set to their minimum possible values while still satisfying the constraints.

Let's assume the smallest possible value for `l` and `r` that satisfies \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) and \(r - l \leq 50\). This would be \(l = 1\) and \(r = 1\), but since \(r\) must be strictly greater than or equal to \(l\), the next smallest valid pair is \(l = 1\) and \(r = 61\).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `l` must be an integer.
- `r` must be an integer.
- \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^{18}\) should hold.
- \(r - l \leq 50\) should hold.

Given these constraints, a specific state that ensures the loop can execute is:

State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ 10^18, `r` - `l` ≤ 50**
