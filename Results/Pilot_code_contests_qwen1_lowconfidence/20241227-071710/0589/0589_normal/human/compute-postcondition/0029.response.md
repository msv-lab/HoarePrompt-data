Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is `r + 1`
   - `b` is `r + 2`
   - `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`
   - Either `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`

2. **Understand the Loop Statement:**
   - The loop runs over `b` in the range from `a + 1` to `r + 1`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `b`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was `r + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `r + 3`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `b < r + 1`.
   - With `b` now being `r + 3`, this condition (`b < r + 1`) is not satisfied.

5. **Consider the Constraint on `r`:**
   - The value of `r` remains unchanged because the loop is incrementing `b` and not modifying `r`.

6. **Re-evaluate the Functional Constraints:**
   - Since the loop is about to terminate, we don't need to change the functional constraints based on `func_5`.

7. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `a` remains `r + 1` (unchanged).
   - `b` becomes `r + 3` (the next value after `r + 2`).
   - `r` remains `r` (unchanged).

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `b` being incremented to `r + 3`.

**State: **`a` is `r + 1`, `b` is `r + 3`, `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50`. Either `func_5(r, b) != 1` or `func_5(b, a) == 1`**
