Postcondition: ***`a` is `r`, `b` is `a + 2`, and `r` is an integer where `r - l <= 50` and no `b` exists in `[r+1, r]` such that `func_5(r, b) == 1` and `func_5(b, a) != 1`. The function returns `a` under the condition specified in the if part, and no other action is taken if the condition is not met.***
