Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `r` are such that `a` is within the range `[l, r-1]`, and the following holds: either `func_5(r, b + 1) â‰  1` or `func_5(b + 1, a) == 1`. If the condition `func_5(r, b) == 1 and func_5(b, a) != 1` is met, then the function returns `a`, `b`, and `r`. Otherwise, no return value is specified since there is no else part in the code.***
