The function `func_5` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` where `a > 0`, `b > 0`, and `a â‰  b`. It repeatedly updates `a` and `b` using the modulus operation until `a` is divisible by `b` without a remainder. After the loop, it returns the value of `b`. However, due to the annotations being incomplete, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` should be reconsidered. In reality, `a` will be equal to `b`, and `c` will hold the original remainder of `a % b`. Since the loop terminates when `a` is divisible by `b`, the returned value of `b` is effectively the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`. The function always returns 0, which is incorrect given the intended logic.
