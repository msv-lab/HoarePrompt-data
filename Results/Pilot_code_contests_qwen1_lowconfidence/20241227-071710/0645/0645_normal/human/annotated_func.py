#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and writes it to the standard error stream followed by a newline character. It then returns the original string `s`. This function does not modify the input string or perform any additional operations on it. Potential edge cases include when `s` is an empty string or contains special characters. The function will handle these cases by simply writing them to the standard error stream without any issues.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: inp() is a function that reads an integer from standard input.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input using the inp() function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads an integer from standard input using the `inp()` function. It then returns this integer. There are no edge cases mentioned or implied by the current code that need special handling. The function ensures that only integers are read from standard input; if `inp()` were to return a non-integer value (e.g., a string or float), the function would fail to execute as intended, which is not covered by the provided postconditions or annotations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of integers where each integer a_i is either 0 or 1.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers, each integer being either 0 or 1 as specified in the input string
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` reads a space-separated string of integers (either 0 or 1) from standard input and returns a list of these integers. The function accepts no parameters other than the implicit input from standard input. There are no explicit inputs provided to the function within the code. The returned list contains only integers that are either 0 or 1, as specified in the input string. If the input string does not consist solely of 0s and 1s separated by spaces, the behavior of the function is undefined.
