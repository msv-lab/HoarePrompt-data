The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and writes it to the standard error stream followed by a newline character. It then returns the original string `s`. This function does not modify the input string or perform any additional operations on it. Potential edge cases include when `s` is an empty string or contains special characters. The function will handle these cases by simply writing them to the standard error stream without any issues.
