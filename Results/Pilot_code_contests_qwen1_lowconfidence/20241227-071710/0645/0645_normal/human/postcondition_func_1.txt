The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads an integer from standard input using the `inp()` function. It then returns this integer. There are no edge cases mentioned or implied by the current code that need special handling. The function ensures that only integers are read from standard input; if `inp()` were to return a non-integer value (e.g., a string or float), the function would fail to execute as intended, which is not covered by the provided postconditions or annotations.
