The function `func_3()` reads a space-separated string of integers (either 0 or 1) from standard input and returns a list of these integers. The function accepts no parameters other than the implicit input from standard input. There are no explicit inputs provided to the function within the code. The returned list contains only integers that are either 0 or 1, as specified in the input string. If the input string does not consist solely of 0s and 1s separated by spaces, the behavior of the function is undefined.
