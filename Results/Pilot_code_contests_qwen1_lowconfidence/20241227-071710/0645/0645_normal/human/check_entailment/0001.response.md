Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined but not used in the context of solving the problem. The main logic required to determine if a good set of choices exists and to output such a set is missing. 

To solve this problem, you would need to implement a solution that checks if there exists a set of choices (putting a ball in some boxes or not) that satisfies the given conditions. The program as provided does not attempt to do this, making it incorrect.
