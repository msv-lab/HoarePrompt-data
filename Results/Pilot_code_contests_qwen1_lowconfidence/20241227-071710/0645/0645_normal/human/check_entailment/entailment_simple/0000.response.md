Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the integer \(N\) from standard input using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the list of integers \(A\) (each either 0 or 1) from standard input using `func_3()`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes an array `out` of length \(N\) filled with zeros, which will store the result indicating whether a ball should be placed in each box.
   - An empty list `B` is initialized to store the indices of the boxes that will contain a ball.

3. **Backward Iteration and Logic:**
   - The program iterates backward from \(N-1\) to 0. For each index \(i\):
     - It calculates the sum `S` of the `out` values at indices that are multiples of \(i+1\).
     - If `S % 2` does not match \(A[i]\), it sets `out[i]` to 1 and appends \(i+1\) to the list `B`. This ensures that the condition for a good set of choices is met.
   
4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the size of the list `B`, which represents the number of boxes that will contain a ball.
   - If `B` is not empty, it prints the elements of `B` separated by spaces.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where no good set of choices exists by printing `-1` if `B` remains empty after the loop.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly checks and ensures that the condition for a good set of choices is met for all integers \(i\) between 1 and \(N\). Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
