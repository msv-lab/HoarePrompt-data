Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: We need to determine if there exists a good set of choices for putting balls into the boxes such that for every integer \(i\) between 1 and \(N\), the total number of balls in the boxes with multiples of \(i\) written on them is congruent to \(a_i\) modulo 2.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of boxes \(N\) and the list of integers \(a\) from standard input.
   - It initializes an output list `out` of length \(N\) with all elements set to 0.
   - It iterates backward through the list, starting from index \(N-1\).
   - For each index \(i\), it calculates the sum of the elements in `out` for positions that are multiples of \(i+1\).
   - If the sum modulo 2 does not match \(a[i]\), it sets `out[i]` to 1 and records \(i+1\) as part of the solution.
   - Finally, it prints the number of boxes with balls and the indices of those boxes.

3. **Annotations and Edge Cases**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: Writes a string to standard error and returns it. This function is not used in the main logic, so it doesn't affect the correctness directly.
   - **Function `func_2`**: Reads an integer from standard input. This handles the input validation for \(N\), which is required according to the problem description.
   - **Function `func_3`**: Reads a list of integers from standard input. This function ensures that the input list consists of 0s and 1s, which aligns with the problem constraints.

4. **Validation**:
   - The code handles the main logic correctly by ensuring that the conditions described in the problem are met.
   - The backward iteration and conditional assignment of `out[i]` ensure that the constraints are checked and respected.
   - The code correctly outputs the result or `-1` if no valid configuration exists.

Since the code follows the problem description and the provided annotations accurately reflect the functionality, the program is correct for every potential case.
