Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The problem description asks for a function to determine if there exists a good set of choices to put balls in the boxes such that for every integer \(i\) between 1 and \(N\), the total number of balls in the boxes with multiples of \(i\) written on them is congruent to \(a_i\) modulo 2. However, the given program consists only of three placeholder functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) and does not contain any logic to solve the problem.

Here is an example to demonstrate why this program is incorrect:

For the input:
```
3
1 0 0
```
The expected output would be:
```
1
1
```
But since the provided program does not contain any logic to handle this input, it will not produce any output, which is not a valid solution according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to address the problem's requirements.
