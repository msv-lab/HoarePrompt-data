Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not contain any logic to solve the problem. Although the function `func_3()` is defined to read a space-separated string of integers and return a list of these integers, it does not use this functionality to solve the problem at hand. The main goal of the problem is to determine if there exists a set of choices to put balls in the boxes such that the total number of balls in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to `a_i` modulo 2 for all i. However, the provided code does not contain any implementation to check this condition or generate a valid set of choices. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct based on the problem description.
