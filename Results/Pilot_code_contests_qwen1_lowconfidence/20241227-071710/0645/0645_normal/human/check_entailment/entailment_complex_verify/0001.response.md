Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program does indeed solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the integer \(N\) and the list \(A\) of integers, each being 0 or 1, from standard input using the functions `func_2` and `func_3`.
   
2. **Logic Implementation**: The program initializes a list `out` to store the state of each box (whether a ball is placed or not). It iterates backward through the list, determining for each box whether a ball should be placed to satisfy the given condition. This is done by checking the parity of the number of balls in boxes with multiples of the current index. If the current condition is not met, a ball is placed in the current box.

3. **Output Generation**: After determining the state of each box, the program outputs the number of boxes that contain a ball and their indices. If no valid configuration exists, it prints `-1`.

Given the annotations and the logic implemented, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The original assessment was likely based on the absence of these core functionalities in the initial version of the program, but now that these functionalities are present and correctly implemented, the program meets the requirements. Therefore, the final assessment is **True**.
