You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right. The integer i is written on the i-th box from the left (1 \leq i \leq N).

For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.

We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:

* For every integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to a_i modulo 2.



Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* a_i is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

If a good set of choices does not exist, print `-1`.

If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:


M
b_1 b_2 ... b_M


where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.

Functions with output description for each function:
from collections import *
import sys

inp = raw_input
N = func_2()
A = func_3()
out = [0] * N
fail = False
B = []
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    j = i + 1
    S = 0
    for k in range(i, N, j):
        S += out[k]
    if S % 2 != A[i]:
        out[i] = 1
        B.append(j)
print(len(B))
if len(B):
    print(' '.join(map(str, B)))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and writes it to the standard error stream followed by a newline character. It then returns the original string `s`. This function does not modify the input string or perform any additional operations on it. Potential edge cases include when `s` is an empty string or contains special characters. The function will handle these cases by simply writing them to the standard error stream without any issues.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and reads an integer from standard input using the `inp()` function. It then returns this integer. There are no edge cases mentioned or implied by the current code that need special handling. The function ensures that only integers are read from standard input; if `inp()` were to return a non-integer value (e.g., a string or float), the function would fail to execute as intended, which is not covered by the provided postconditions or annotations.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3()` reads a space-separated string of integers (either 0 or 1) from standard input and returns a list of these integers. The function accepts no parameters other than the implicit input from standard input. There are no explicit inputs provided to the function within the code. The returned list contains only integers that are either 0 or 1, as specified in the input string. If the input string does not consist solely of 0s and 1s separated by spaces, the behavior of the function is undefined.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
