The function `func_3()` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input a space-separated string of six integers. It then converts this string into a map object containing these six integers. The function returns this map object. Potential edge cases include the user inputting more or fewer than six integers, in which case the function will raise a ValueError, or inputting non-integer values, which will also result in a ValueError.
