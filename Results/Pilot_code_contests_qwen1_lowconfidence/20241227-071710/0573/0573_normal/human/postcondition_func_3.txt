The function `func_4` returns a list generated by the `func_3` function. It takes no parameters and does not modify any external variables. The list returned by `func_3` is the only output of `func_4`. There are no specific postconditions provided about the contents of the list, so the exact elements within the list depend entirely on the implementation of `func_3`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `func_3` might return an empty list or handle unexpected input, which would affect the output of `func_4`.
