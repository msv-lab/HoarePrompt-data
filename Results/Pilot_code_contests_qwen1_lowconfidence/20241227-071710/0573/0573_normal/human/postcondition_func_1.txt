The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns values for `x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6`. However, the function body only contains a single `return input()` statement, which implies that the function is expected to read input values from the user for these variables. Given the constraints (0 ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ 10^6 and 0 ≤ y_i < y_{i+1} ≤ 10^6), the function should ensure that the input values satisfy these conditions. If the input does not meet these constraints, the function should handle such cases appropriately, either by prompting the user again or raising an error. Since the function body only contains `input()`, it will read the values and return them without performing any checks or transformations.
