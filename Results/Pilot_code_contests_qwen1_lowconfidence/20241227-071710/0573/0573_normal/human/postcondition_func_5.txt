The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple containing at least one element. The function returns the first element of this tuple. Given the context of the input parameters before the function call, the function effectively extracts and returns the value `x_1`, which represents the x-coordinate of the bottom-left corner of the white sheet. There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the input tuple. The function does not modify any input values; it simply returns the first element of the provided tuple. No edge cases or missing functionality are present in the given code.
