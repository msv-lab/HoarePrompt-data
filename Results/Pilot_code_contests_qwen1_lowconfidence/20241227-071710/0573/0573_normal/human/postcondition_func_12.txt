The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After executing the algorithm, the function returns `x` as the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and sets `y` to 0. The function handles the case where `x` or `y` is 0 by correctly returning the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function will return 0, which is mathematically correct but may need special handling depending on the application.
