The function `func_15` changes the file streams for standard input and output to read from 'input.txt' and write to 'output.txt', respectively. It does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. After executing this function, the standard input stream is redirected to read from 'input.txt', and the standard output stream is redirected to write to 'output.txt'. This redirection persists until the streams are closed or the program terminates. There are no postconditions specified in the return postconditions, implying that the function's purpose is solely to perform the redirection of file streams.
