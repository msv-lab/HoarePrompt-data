The function `func_1` waits for user input and returns an integer within the specified ranges for \(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6,\) and \(y_6\). There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the input. The function simply captures the user's integer input and ensures it falls within the defined ranges before returning it. If the user inputs a value outside these ranges, the function will continue to prompt until a valid input is received.
