(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) are the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the white sheet, (x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4) are the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the first black sheet, and (x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6) are the coordinates of the bottom left and top right corners of the second black sheet. All coordinates are integers such that 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^6.
