The function `func_5` sets the recursion limit and stack size for a new thread, starts a new thread to execute the `main` function, and returns `True` if any two of the six given rectangles overlap, and `False` otherwise. The function does not directly return anything; instead, the result of the `main` function run in the new thread determines the return value.
