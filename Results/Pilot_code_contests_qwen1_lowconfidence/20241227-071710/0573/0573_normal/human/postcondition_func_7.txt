The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n` (the height of the 2D list), `m` (the width of the 2D list), and `num` (an integer value). It returns a 2D list of dimensions `n x m`, where every element in the list is set to the integer value `num`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code itself correctly implements the described behavior. The function does not have any missing functionality as per the provided code.
