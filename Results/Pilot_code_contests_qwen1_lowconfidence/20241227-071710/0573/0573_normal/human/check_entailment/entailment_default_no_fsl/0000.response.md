Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_18` does not correctly determine if the white sheet can be seen after placing the two black sheets. Specifically, the logic for determining if the white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets is flawed.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Coordinate Updates**: The code updates the coordinates of the black sheets to ensure they lie within the bounds of the white sheet. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect conclusions. The goal is to check if there is any part of the white sheet that is not covered by the black sheets, not to restrict the black sheets to the bounds of the white sheet.

2. **Overlap Calculation**: The code calculates the areas of the black sheets and compares them to the area of the white sheet. This is a good approach, but the way it is implemented is incorrect. It incorrectly assumes that if the sum of the areas of the black sheets is less than the area of the white sheet, then there is a visible part. However, this does not account for the possibility that the black sheets might cover parts of the white sheet in such a way that their union does not completely cover the white sheet.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the black sheets might be positioned such that they partially cover the white sheet but still leave a visible part. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   2 2 4 4
   1 1 3 5
   3 3 5 5
   ```
   In this case, the black sheets partially cover the white sheet but leave a small visible part. The current implementation would incorrectly conclude that the white sheet is fully covered.

To fix this, the code should:
- Directly check if any point in the white sheet is not covered by the black sheets.
- Use a more robust geometric approach to determine if there is any intersection between the white sheet and the black sheets.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
