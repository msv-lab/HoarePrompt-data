You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a white sheet of paper lying on a rectangle table. The sheet is a rectangle with its sides parallel to the sides of the table. If you will take a look from above and assume that the bottom left corner of the table has coordinates (0, 0), and coordinate axes are left and bottom sides of the table, then the bottom left corner of the white sheet has coordinates (x_1, y_1), and the top right — (x_2, y_2).

After that two black sheets of paper are placed on the table. Sides of both black sheets are also parallel to the sides of the table. Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the first black sheet are (x_3, y_3), and the top right — (x_4, y_4). Coordinates of the bottom left corner of the second black sheet are (x_5, y_5), and the top right — (x_6, y_6). 

<image> Example of three rectangles.

Determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed. The part of the white sheet can be seen if there is at least one point lying not strictly inside the white sheet and strictly outside of both black sheets.

Input

The first line of the input contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^{6}, 0 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^{6}) — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the white sheet.

The second line of the input contains four integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 (0 ≤ x_3 < x_4 ≤ 10^{6}, 0 ≤ y_3 < y_4 ≤ 10^{6}) — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the first black sheet.

The third line of the input contains four integers x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6 (0 ≤ x_5 < x_6 ≤ 10^{6}, 0 ≤ y_5 < y_6 ≤ 10^{6}) — coordinates of the bottom left and the top right corners of the second black sheet.

The sides of each sheet of paper are parallel (perpendicular) to the coordinate axes.

Output

If some part of the white sheet can be seen from the above after the two black sheets are placed, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise print "NO".

Note

In the first example the white sheet is fully covered by black sheets.

In the second example the part of the white sheet can be seen after two black sheets are placed. For example, the point (6.5, 4.5) lies not strictly inside the white sheet and lies strictly outside of both black sheets.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if some part of the white sheet can be seen after placing the two black sheets. Specifically, the program does not properly check if there is any part of the white sheet that is not covered by both black sheets.

Let's analyze the problematic parts:

1. **Intersection Handling**: The program checks if the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets using the conditions:
   ```python
   if x5 > x2 or y6 < y1 or x6 < x1 or (y5 > y2):
       one = False
   if y3 > y2 or y4 < y1 or x3 > x2 or (x4 < x1):
       two = False
   ```

   These conditions are used to check if the black sheets cover the entire white sheet, but they do not handle the intersection of the black sheets properly. The program should consider the intersection area and determine if there is any part of the white sheet that is not covered by both black sheets.

2. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the areas of the black sheets and the white sheet, but it does not correctly determine if there is any uncovered area of the white sheet. The condition `if a1 + a2 < area:` only checks if the sum of the areas of the black sheets is less than the area of the white sheet, which is not sufficient to determine if there is any uncovered part of the white sheet.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the intersection areas and check if there is any part of the white sheet that is not covered by the black sheets. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_see_white_sheet(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, x5, y5, x6, y6):
    # Check if the white sheet is completely covered by the first black sheet
    if x3 <= x1 and y3 <= y1 and x4 >= x2 and y4 >= y2:
        return False
    # Check if the white sheet is completely covered by the second black sheet
    if x5 <= x1 and y5 <= y1 and x6 >= x2 and y6 >= y2:
        return False
    
    # Calculate the intersection areas
    intersection_area_1 = max(0, min(x4, x6) - max(x3, x5)) * max(0, min(y4, y6) - max(y3, y5))
    intersection_area_2 = max(0, min(x4, x6) - max(x3, x5)) * max(0, min(y4, y6) - max(y3, y5))
    
    # Check if there is any uncovered part of the white sheet
    if (x1 + intersection_area_1 < x2) or (y1 + intersection_area_2 < y2):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
(x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
(x3, y3, x4, y4) = map(int, input().strip().split())
(x5, y5, x6, y6) = map(int, input().strip().split())

if can_see_white_sheet(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, x5, y5, x6, y6):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

This corrected version handles the intersection areas more accurately and checks if there is any uncovered part of the white sheet. If the program still fails to handle some edge cases, it will be marked as incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 19 : The function `func_19()` does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. It prints the elements of the `args` tuple to a file, which defaults to `sys.stdout`. The function supports additional keyword arguments to customize the output: `sep` for the separator between elements, `end` for the string appended after the last element, and `flush` to control whether the buffer is flushed after the operation. If `flush` is set to `True` (or `kwargs['flush']` is `True`), the buffer is flushed. The final state of the program after the function executes is that `args` elements have been printed to the specified file, separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. The `kwargs` dictionary is cleared of the used keys (`sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`).+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
