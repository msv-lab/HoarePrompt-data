Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_18` does not correctly determine if any part of the white sheet can be seen from above after placing the two black sheets. Specifically, it incorrectly handles the condition where the white sheet is partially covered but still has an uncovered part. The provided output hints confirm that `func_19` is used to print the final result, but they do not address the core logic issue in `func_18`. The example inputs and expected outputs provided in the problem description demonstrate that the current implementation does not work as intended. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
