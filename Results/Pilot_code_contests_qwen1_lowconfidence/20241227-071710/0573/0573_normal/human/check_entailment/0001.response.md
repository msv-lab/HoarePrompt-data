Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if any part of the white sheet can be seen from above after placing the two black sheets. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the condition where the white sheet is partially covered but still has an uncovered part. Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
2 2 4 4
1 1 3 5
3 1 5 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" for this input. This happens because the program checks if the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets and fails to check if there is any part of the white sheet that is not covered by either black sheet.

To illustrate, let's break down the example:
- White sheet: (2, 2) to (4, 4)
- First black sheet: (1, 1) to (3, 5)
- Second black sheet: (3, 1) to (5, 5)

The white sheet is fully covered by the black sheets, but the program incorrectly determines that there is a visible part of the white sheet.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the condition where the white sheet is partially covered but still has an uncovered part. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
