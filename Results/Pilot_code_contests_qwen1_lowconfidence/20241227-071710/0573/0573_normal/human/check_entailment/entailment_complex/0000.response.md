Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if any part of the white sheet can be seen after placing two black sheets on the table. Let's analyze the key parts of the code and compare them to the problem description:

1. **Coordinate Extraction**:
   - The code correctly uses `func_3()` to extract the coordinates of the white sheet, the first black sheet, and the second black sheet.
   - The coordinates are extracted correctly and stored in the appropriate variables.

2. **Overlap Check**:
   - The code uses nested if-else statements to check for overlap between the white sheet and the black sheets.
   - The logic in the `if (x5 > x2 or y6 < y1 or x6 < x1 or y5 > y2) :` block and similar blocks is intended to check if the black sheets overlap with the white sheet.
   - However, the logic does not correctly handle all possible overlap scenarios. For instance, it does not account for cases where the black sheets partially overlap the white sheet.

3. **Area Calculation and Decision Making**:
   - The code attempts to calculate the areas of the involved rectangles and compares them to decide if the white sheet is visible.
   - The logic in `if (a1 + a2 < area) :` and similar blocks is intended to check if the total area of the black sheets is less than the area of the white sheet.
   - However, this logic does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when the black sheets only partially cover the white sheet.

4. **Function Calls**:
   - The code calls `func_16()` and `func_17()` based on the outcome of the area comparison.
   - `func_16()` prints "NO" and exits, while `func_17()` prints "YES" and exits.
   - This logic does not correctly determine visibility based on the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the following counterexample:
- White sheet: (1, 1) to (3, 3)
- First black sheet: (2, 2) to (4, 4)
- Second black sheet: (2, 2) to (4, 4)

In this case, the white sheet is completely covered by the black sheets, but the code might incorrectly conclude that some part of the white sheet is still visible, leading to a wrong output of "YES".

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, hence the Correctness is **False**.
