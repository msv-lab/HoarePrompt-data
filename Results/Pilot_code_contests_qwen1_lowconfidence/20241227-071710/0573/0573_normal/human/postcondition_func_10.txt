The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers derived from the digits of `n`. Specifically, it converts the string representation of `n` into a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `n`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotation or code, but the function correctly handles positive integers. It does not handle negative integers, non-integer inputs, or zero.
