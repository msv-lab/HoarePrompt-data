The function `func_17` accepts four sets of coordinates representing the boundaries of a white sheet and two black sheets. It then calls another function `func_19` with the argument 'NO'. The purpose of the function is to determine whether the white sheet overlaps with at least one of the black sheets. However, since `func_19` is called with the argument 'NO', it is unclear what the function `func_19` does in this context. If `func_19` is supposed to check for overlap, it is missing from the given code. Therefore, the function `func_17` will always return 'NO' without performing any overlap checks, making the overall functionality ineffective for its intended purpose.
