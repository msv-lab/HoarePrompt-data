The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing coordinates (x, y) of points. The function returns a new list of these tuples sorted based on the value returned by the `getKey` function for each tuple. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but it is assumed that `getKey` is defined elsewhere and can handle any valid input provided in the tuples. If `getKey` returns the same value for multiple tuples, the original order of those tuples in the list `l` is preserved.
