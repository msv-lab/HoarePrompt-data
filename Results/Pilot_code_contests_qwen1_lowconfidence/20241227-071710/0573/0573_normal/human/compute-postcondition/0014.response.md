Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `at_start` is `False`
   - `file` contains the string representation of `x`

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `args`.
   - On each iteration, `x` takes the value of the current element from `args`.

3. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, it needs to have more elements to iterate over in `args`.
   - The loop condition depends on the presence of elements in `args`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `at_start` is already `False`, it indicates that we are not at the beginning of processing `args`.
   - We need to ensure that `args` still has elements left to process.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `at_start` remains `False` because we are not at the start of processing `args` again.
   - `file` will contain the string representation of the next element in `args`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `args` still has elements left to process, and `file` will contain the string representation of the next element in `args`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`at_start` is `False`; file contains the string representation of the next element in `args`**
