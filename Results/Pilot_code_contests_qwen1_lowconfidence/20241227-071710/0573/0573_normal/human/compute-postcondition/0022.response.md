`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the file buffer, but does not affect the content of `file`, `at_start`, `args`, `sep`, `kwargs`, or the popped value of `kwargs['flush']`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the concatenation of all elements in `args` converted to strings, separated by `sep`, followed by a newline character `\n`, `kwargs` is now `{}`, and the current value of `kwargs` after popping 'flush' is either `False` or the value that was popped from `kwargs`, and the file buffer is flushed.**
