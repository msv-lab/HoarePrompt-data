`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x_1` is an integer, `y_1` is an integer, `x_2` is an integer, `y_2` is an integer, `x_3` is an integer, `y_3` is an integer, `x_4` is an integer, `y_4` is an integer, `x_5` is an integer, `y_5` is an integer, `x_6` is an integer, `y_6` is an integer, `sep` is either the value of `'sep'` in `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is either the value of `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `True`.

Output State: **`x_1` is an integer, `y_1` is an integer, `x_2` is an integer, `y_2` is an integer, `x_3` is an integer, `y_3` is an integer, `x_4` is an integer, `y_4` is an integer, `x_5` is an integer, `y_5` is an integer, `x_6` is an integer, `y_6` is an integer, `sep` is either the value of `'sep'` in `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is either the value of `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
