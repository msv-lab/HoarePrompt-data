`func_16()` is called without any arguments, which means it will perform some operations internally. However, since no specific details about what `func_16()` does are provided, we can only state that it modifies the state of variables within its scope. The variables outside the scope of `func_16()` remain unchanged.

From the initial state, we know:
- `x1` is between 0 and `x2` (exclusive).
- `y1` is between 0 and `y2` (exclusive).
- `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`.
- `y5` is the result of `func_3()` with `y5` updated to the maximum of its current value and `y1`.
- `x6` is the minimum value between its current value and `x2`.
- `y6` is the minimum value between `y6_initial` and `y2`.
- `y4` is the minimum value between `y4_initial` and `y2`.
- `one` is `False`.
- `two` is `False`.
- `a2` is `abs(max(x1, x1) - min(x2, x2)) * abs(max(y1, y1) - min(y6_initial, y2))`.
- `x4` is the minimum value between its original value and `x2`.
- `x3` is the maximum value between `x3` and `x1`.
- `a2` is less than `area`.

After calling `func_16()`, the values of `x5`, `y5`, `x6`, `y6`, `y4`, and potentially `a2` could be updated, but without knowing the exact operations performed by `func_16()`, we cannot determine their new values precisely. However, we can state that the function may modify these variables.

The variables outside the scope of `func_16()` remain unchanged.
