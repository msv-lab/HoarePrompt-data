Functionality: **The function `func_18` takes no explicit parameters but relies on the outputs of `func_3()` and internal state variables. It performs a series of checks and updates based on the results of these calls to `func_3()`. Specifically, it:

1. Calls `func_3()` three times to get coordinates `(x1, y1)`, `(x5, y5)`, and `(x6, y6)`.
2. Calls `func_3()` again to get coordinates `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)`.
3. Checks if certain conditions involving the coordinates are met using `one` and `two` flags. If both `one` and `two` are `False`, it calls `func_16()` and exits.
4. Updates the coordinates `(x3, y3)`, `(x4, y4)`, `(x5, y5)`, and `(x6, y6)` to ensure they are within certain bounds defined by the initial coordinates.
5. Calculates areas of rectangles defined by the coordinates and decides whether to call `func_16()` or `func_17()` based on these areas.
6. Handles potential edge cases where the coordinates might already be within the desired bounds or exceed them, adjusting them accordingly.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `func_3()` returns invalid coordinates (e.g., out of the given range), the function does not handle these cases explicitly.
- The function assumes that `func_3()` always returns valid coordinates, and no validation is performed on the inputs.
- There is no explicit handling for when `func_3()` fails to return expected values or throws an exception, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
- The function does not provide clear feedback or error messages if the conditions are not met, making it difficult to debug issues.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the function, including all potential edge cases and missing logic.
