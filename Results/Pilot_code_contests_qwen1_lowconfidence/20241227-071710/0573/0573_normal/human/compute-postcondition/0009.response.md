According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop will execute as long as `args` contains elements. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is `False`, which means the loop has already executed at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must contain at least one element, and `x` will be the next element in the sequence. Since this is the start of a new iteration, `at_start` should be set to `True` to indicate that we are at the beginning of a new iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`at_start` is `True`**.
