`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the value of `sep` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. The only thing we know is that `at_start` remains unchanged because no assignment or modification to `at_start` is performed in the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is `False`; the file contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by the value of `sep`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`; the file contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by the value of `sep`.**
