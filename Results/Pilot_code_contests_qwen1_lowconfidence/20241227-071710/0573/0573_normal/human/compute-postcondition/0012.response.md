The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. However, since the exact value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact content that gets written. But we know that `at_start` is `True` and the condition for updating the file with `sep` is when `at_start` is `False`. Since `at_start` remains `True`, the file is not updated with `sep`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `True`, file contains the string representation of `x`**
