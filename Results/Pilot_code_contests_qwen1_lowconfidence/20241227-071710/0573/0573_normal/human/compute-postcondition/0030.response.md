The function `func_17()` is called but no specific changes to variables are mentioned in the function call itself. Therefore, the variables that are dependent on the function's behavior are not updated unless explicitly stated within the function. Given that no changes are mentioned, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`x3` is the maximum value between `x3` and `x1`; `x4` is the minimum value between its original value and `x2`; `a1` is `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`; `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`; `y5` is the result of `func_3()`, updated to the maximum of its current value and `y1`; `x6` is the minimum value between its current value and `x2`; `y6` is the minimum value between `y6_initial` and `y2`; `y4` is the minimum value between `y4_initial` and `y2`; `a2` is `abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)`; `one` is `False`; `two` is `False`; `func_16()` is called and `one` remains `False`; `x1` is between 0 and `x2` (exclusive); `y1` is between 0 and `y2` (exclusive); `area` is greater than or equal to `a1 + a2`**
