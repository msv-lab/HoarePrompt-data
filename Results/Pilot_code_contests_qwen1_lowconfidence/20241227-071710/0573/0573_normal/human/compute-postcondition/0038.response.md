`func_17()` is called, but the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. Since the function is not defined, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables. However, we can list the variables that might be affected and their potential impacts.

- `x5`: It is the maximum of its original value and `x1`. `x1` is between 0 and `x2` (exclusive), so `x5` remains the same as `x1`.
- `y5`: It is the result of `func_3()` with `y5` updated to the maximum of its current value and `y1`. Since `y1` is between 0 and `y2` (exclusive), `y5` could be updated to `y1` if `y1` is greater than `y5`.
- `x6`: It is the minimum value between its current value and `x2`. `x2` is the upper limit for `x6`, so `x6` remains unchanged if it is already less than or equal to `x2`.
- `y6`: It is the minimum value between `y6_initial` and `y2`. `y2` is the upper limit for `y6`, so `y6` remains unchanged if it is already less than or equal to `y2`.
- `y4`: It is the minimum value between `y4_initial` and `y2`. `y2` is the upper limit for `y4`, so `y4` remains unchanged if it is already less than or equal to `y2`.
- `one` and `two`: They remain `False` since no operations that would change them are mentioned.
- `a2`: It is calculated as `abs(max(x1, x1) - min(x2, x2)) * abs(max(y1, y1) - min(y6_initial, y2))`. Given that `x1` is between 0 and `x2` and `y1` is between 0 and `y2`, `a2` simplifies to `abs(x2 - x1) * abs(y2 - y1)`.
- `x4`: It is the minimum value between its original value and `x2`. `x2` is the upper limit for `x4`, so `x4` remains unchanged if it is already less than or equal to `x2`.
- `x3`: It is the maximum value between `x3` and `x1`. `x1` is between 0 and `x2` (exclusive), so `x3` could be updated to `x1` if `x1` is greater than `x3`.

Given these points, the Output State is:

Output State: **`x1` is between 0 and `x2` (exclusive); `y1` is between 0 and `y2` (exclusive); `x5` is the same as `x1`; `y5` is the maximum of its current value and `y1`; `x6` is the same as its current value; `y6` is the same as `y6_initial` if `y6_initial` is less than or equal to `y2`, otherwise it is `y2`; `y4` is the same as `y4_initial` if `y4_initial` is less than or equal to `y2`, otherwise it is `y2`; `one` is `False`; `two` is `False`; `a2` is `abs(x2 - x1) * abs(y2 - y1)`; `x4` is the same as its current value if it is less than or equal to `x2`, otherwise it is `x2`; `x3` is the maximum of `x3` and `x1`.**
