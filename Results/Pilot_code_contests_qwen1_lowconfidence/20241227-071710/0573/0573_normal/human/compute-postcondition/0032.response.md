Postcondition: **`x1` is between 0 and `x2` (exclusive); `y1` is between 0 and `y2` (exclusive); `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`; `y5` is the result of `func_3()` with `y5` updated to the maximum of its current value and `y1`; `x6` is the minimum value between its current value and `x2`; `y6` is the minimum value between `y6_initial` and `y2`; `y4` is the minimum value between `y4_initial` and `y2`; `one` is `False`; `two` is `False`; `func_16()` is called and `one` remains `False`; `x4` is the minimum value between its original value and `x2`; `x3` is the maximum value between `x3` and `x1`; `two` is `False`**
