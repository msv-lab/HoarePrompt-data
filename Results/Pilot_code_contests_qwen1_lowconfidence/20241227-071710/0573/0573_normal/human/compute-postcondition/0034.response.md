Output State: **`x1` is between 0 and `x2` (exclusive); `y1` is between 0 and `y2` (exclusive); `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`; `y5` is the result of `func_3()` with `y5` updated to the maximum of its current value and `y1`; `x6` is the minimum value between its current value and `x2`; `y6` is the minimum value between `y6_initial` and `y2`; `y4` is the minimum value between `y4_initial` and `y2`; `one` is `False`; `two` is `False`; `a2` is `abs(max(x1, x1) - min(x2, x2)) * abs(max(y1, y1) - min(y6_initial, y2))`; `x4` is the minimum value between its original value and `x2`; `x3` is the maximum value between `x3` and `x1`**

Explanation:
- `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`, so `x5` is `max(x1, x1)`, which simplifies to `x1`.
- `x6` is the minimum value between its current value and `x2`, so `x6` is `min(x2, x2)`, which simplifies to `x2`.
- `a2` is calculated as `abs(x5 - x6) * abs(y5 - y6)`. Substituting `x5` and `x6` gives `abs(x1 - x2) * abs(y5 - y6)`.
- `y5` is the result of `func_3()` with `y5` updated to the maximum of its current value and `y1`, but the exact value of `y5` is not specified, so it remains as `y5`.
- `y6` is the minimum value between `y6_initial` and `y2`, so `y6` is `min(y6_initial, y2)`.
- `y4` is the minimum value between `y4_initial` and `y2`, so `y4` is `min(y4_initial, y2)`.
- `one` is set to `False` by the call to `func_16()`.
- `two` remains `False`.
- `x4` is the minimum value between its original value and `x2`, but the exact value of `x4` is not specified, so it remains as `x4`.
- `x3` is the maximum value between `x3` and `x1`, so `x3` is `max(x3, x1)`.
