The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file. Initially, the file contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by the value of `sep`. After executing this line, the file will contain the string representation of `x` appended to the existing content. However, the values of the variables `at_start` and `args` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, the file contains the string representation of the next element in `args` followed by the value of `sep` and then the string representation of `x`.**
