The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` does the following:

- It pops the value of the key `'sep'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns it to the variable `sep`. If `'sep'` is not in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space `' '`.
- It pops the value of the key `'file'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and assigns it to the variable `file`. If `'file'` is not in `kwargs`, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

These operations do not affect the values of `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, `x_3`, `y_3`, `x_4`, `y_4`, `x_5`, `y_5`, `x_6`, and `y_6`. The values of `sep` and `file` are assigned based on the `kwargs` dictionary, but since no specific values for these keys are provided in the initial state, their values remain undefined.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`x_1` is an integer, `y_1` is an integer, `x_2` is an integer, `y_2` is an integer, `x_3` is an integer, `y_3` is an integer, `x_4` is an integer, `y_4` is an integer, `x_5` is an integer, `y_5` is an integer, `x_6` is an integer, `y_6` is an integer, `sep` is either the value of `'sep'` in `kwargs` or a space `' '`, `file` is either the value of `'file'` in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.**
