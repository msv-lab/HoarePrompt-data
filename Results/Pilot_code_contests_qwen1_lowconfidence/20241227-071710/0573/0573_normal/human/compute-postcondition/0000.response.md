The given code snippet is a comment and does not perform any operations that would change the values of the variables. The comment simply instructs that the values will be printed to a stream, but no printing is actually done, and no variables are modified.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`x_1` is an integer, `y_1` is an integer, `x_2` is an integer, `y_2` is an integer, `x_3` is an integer, `y_3` is an integer, `x_4` is an integer, `y_4` is an integer, `x_5` is an integer, `y_5` is an integer, `x_6` is an integer, `y_6` is an integer such that 0 <= `x_1` < `x_2` <= 10^6, 0 <= `y_1` < `y_2` <= 10^6, 0 <= `x_3` < `x_4` <= 10^6, 0 <= `y_3` < `y_4` <= 10^6, 0 <= `x_5` < `x_6` <= 10^6, 0 <= `y_5` < `y_6` <= 10^6.**
