Postcondition: ***`x1` is between 0 and `x2` (exclusive), `y1` is between 0 and `y2` (exclusive), `x5` is the maximum of its original value and `x1`, `y5` is the result of `func_3()` with `y5` updated to the maximum of its current value and `y1`, `x6` is the minimum value between its current value and `x2`, `y6` is the minimum value between `y6_initial` and `y2`, `y4` is the minimum value between `y4_initial` and `y2`, `one` is `False`, `two` is `True`, `a1` is `abs(x3 - x4) * abs(y3 - y4)`. If `a1` is less than `area`, `func_16()` is called. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
