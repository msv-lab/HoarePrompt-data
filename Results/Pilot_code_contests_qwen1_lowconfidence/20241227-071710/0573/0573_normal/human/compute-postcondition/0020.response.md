`file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file and removes this key-value pair from `kwargs`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `kwargs`, we assume `kwargs` initially contains `'end': '\n'` (the default value), and the write operation appends `\n` to the file.

The variable `file` is updated by writing to it, but its exact content is not specified in the initial state. The variable `at_start` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the `'end': '\n'` key-value pair.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the concatenation of all elements in `args` converted to strings, separated by `sep`, followed by a newline character `\n`, `kwargs` is now `{}`**
