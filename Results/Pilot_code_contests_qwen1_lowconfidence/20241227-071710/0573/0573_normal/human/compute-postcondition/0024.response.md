The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. The given constraints describe six pairs of integers (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4), (x_5, y_5), and (x_6, y_6) with specific conditions, but these constraints are not part of the function's input.

Since the function signature is `def func_19():`, it implies that the function does not take any arguments.

Given the information provided, the function likely uses the constraints internally, but since no specific behavior or output is mentioned, we can only describe the function's signature.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters.**
