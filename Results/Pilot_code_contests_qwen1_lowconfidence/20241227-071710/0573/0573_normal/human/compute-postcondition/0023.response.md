Postcondition: ***`at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the concatenation of all elements in `args` converted to strings, separated by `sep`, followed by a newline character `\n`, `kwargs` is now `{}`, and the file buffer is flushed if `kwargs` had a key 'flush' with a value of `True` (or was `True` when popped). Otherwise, `kwargs` remains unchanged.***
