Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `file` contains the concatenation of all elements in `args` converted to strings, separated by `sep`.**

### Explanation:
- **`at_start`**: The variable `at_start` is initially set to `True` and gets updated to `False` inside the loop. Once the loop starts, `at_start` will always be `False` because the loop condition ensures that `at_start` is set to `False` after the first iteration.
  
- **`file`**: The loop writes each element of `args` to `file` as a string, separated by `sep`. Since `at_start` is `False` after the first iteration, `file.write(sep)` is skipped for all subsequent iterations. Therefore, `file` will contain the concatenation of all string representations of the elements in `args`, separated by `sep`.

- **`args`**: The value of `args` is not changed within the loop, so its original values remain intact. However, the content written to `file` is based on these values.

Given that the loop will write each element of `args` exactly once to `file`, the final state of `file` will be the concatenation of all string representations of the elements in `args`, separated by `sep`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `args` is empty), `at_start` will still be `True` initially but will be set to `False` due to the condition check in the loop. However, since no elements are written to `file`, `file` will remain unchanged from its initial state (which is `sys.stdout` or another specified `file` object).

Thus, the final output state captures the state of all relevant variables after the loop has finished executing.
