x is an integer representing the coordinates of the corners of the white sheet, the first black sheet, and the second black sheet. However, the function `func_9` does not seem to be relevant to the problem description provided, as it does not use the coordinates of the sheets and does not contribute to determining if any part of the white sheet can be seen. Therefore, no precondition related to the problem description can be extracted from this function signature.
