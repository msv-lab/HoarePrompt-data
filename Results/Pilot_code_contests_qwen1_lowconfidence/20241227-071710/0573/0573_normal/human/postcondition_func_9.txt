The function `func_10` accepts an integer `n` as input, which is derived from the initial states of the integers `x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4, x_5, y_5, x_6, y_6`. It then converts `n` into its binary string representation and returns this string without the '0b' prefix. The function simply takes an integer and returns a string representation of its binary form, without any additional operations or transformations.
