The function `func_16` accepts no parameters and calls another function `func_19` with the argument 'YES'. After the call to `func_19`, the function `func_16` terminates without performing any additional operations. There are no local variables or actions defined within `func_16` itself. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged from its initial state, except for the call to `func_19`.
