The function reads an integer `n` from standard input followed by a line of `n` space-separated integers. It returns these values as a single string. There are no input parameters provided to the function, and it handles the case where the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., incorrect number of integers, non-integer values). If the input is valid, it constructs a string in the format "n value1 value2 ... valueN" and returns it. If the input is invalid, the function may raise an exception or behave unpredictably, depending on the underlying implementation of the `input()` function.
