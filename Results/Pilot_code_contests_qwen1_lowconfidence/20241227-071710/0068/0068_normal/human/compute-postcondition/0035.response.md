The variable `r` is reassigned to the value of `m2`. The previous values of `m2` and `r` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is 1, `m1` is `l + (r - l) / 3`, `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`, `p` is `f(m1, a)`, `q` is `f(m2, a)`, `ans` is `min(p, q, ans)`, `r` is `m2`**
