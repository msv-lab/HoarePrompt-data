The code `r = min(r, rr)` updates the value of `r` to be the minimum of its current value and `rr`. Since `rr` is such that `ll <= rr` and `rr >= l`, and given that `l <= r` and `ll <= r`, the updated value of `r` will be `min(r, rr)`, which could be `r` itself if `rr >= r`, or `rr` if `rr < r`.

The states of the other variables (`l`, `ll`, and `rr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is max(l, ll), `r` is min(r, rr), `ll` is an integer such that `ll <= rr` and `ll <= r`, `rr` is an integer such that `ll <= rr` and `rr >= l`.

Output State: **`l` is max(l, ll), `r` is min(r, rr), `ll` is an integer such that `ll <= rr` and `ll <= r`, `rr` is an integer such that `ll <= rr` and `rr >= l**
