Functionality: **The function `func_8` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr`. It checks whether the intervals defined by `l` and `r` overlap with the intervals defined by `ll` and `rr`. If there is no overlap (`ll > r` or `rr < l`), the function returns -1. Otherwise, it adjusts `l` to be the maximum of `l` and `ll`, and `r` to be the minimum of `r` and `rr`. Finally, it returns the maximum of 0 and the difference between the adjusted `r` and `l`. This represents the overlapping length between the two intervals.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where there is no overlap and returns -1.
- The function correctly adjusts `l` and `r` based on `ll` and `rr` when there is an overlap.
- However, the annotation mentions that `ll` and `rr` should satisfy `ll <= rr` and `ll <= r` and `rr >= l` after the adjustments, which is not strictly enforced by the code. The code only updates `l` and `r` based on `ll` and `rr`, but it does not explicitly ensure these conditions hold. Therefore, after the function executes, `ll` and `rr` will still satisfy their initial conditions, but `l` and `r` might not necessarily satisfy `ll <= r` and `rr >= l` due to the nature of the operations performed.**

**Final State:**
- If the intervals do not overlap, the function returns -1.
- If the intervals overlap, the function returns the maximum of 0 and the difference between the adjusted `r` and `l`, representing the overlapping length.
