`ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is the length of `v` plus 1, the value of `2 ** i` is calculated. Since `v` is a binary string, its length is the number of characters in `v`. Let's denote the length of `v` as `len_v`. Therefore, `i = len_v + 1`, and `2 ** i = 2 ** (len_v + 1)`. 

The states of the other variables (`x`, `v`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. So, `x` is still 0, `v` remains a binary string, and `ans` is a list that now includes the value `2 ** (len_v + 1)`.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` is a binary string, `ans` is a list containing `[2 ** (len(v) + 1)]`, `i` is the length of `v` plus 1**
