The code appends the value `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state where `i` is the length of the binary string `v`, the value of `i` is known and will be used to compute `2 ** i`. The value of `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

- `x` is 0
- `v` is a binary string
- `ans` is a list containing the value `2 ** i`
- `i` is the length of the binary string `v`

Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` is a binary string, `ans` is a list containing the value `2 ** i`, `i` is the length of the binary string `v`**
