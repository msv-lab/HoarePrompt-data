`ans` appends the value `2 ** i`. Given the initial state where `i` is such that the current value of `v[i]` is 1, and considering the initial value of `i` must be 0 (since `v` is "0" and the only position with a value of 1 is at index 0), `ans` will append `2 ** 0`, which is 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` is "0", `ans` is [1], the length of `v` is greater than 0, and the current value of `v[i]` is 1**
