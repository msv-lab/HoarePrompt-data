`q` is assigned the value of `f(m2, a)`. The value of `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`, and the value of `p` is `f(m1, a)`, where `m1` is `l + (r - l) / 3`. The values of `h`, `l`, `r`, `a`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is 1, `m1` is `l + (r - l) / 3`, `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`, `p` is `f(m1, a)`, `q` is `f(m2, a)`**
