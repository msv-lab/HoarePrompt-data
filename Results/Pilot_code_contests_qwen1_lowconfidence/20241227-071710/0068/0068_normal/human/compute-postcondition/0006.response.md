The function `func_8` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr`. All parameters are integers with the following constraints: `l` and `r` are such that `l <= r`, and `ll` and `rr` are such that `ll <= rr`.

- In Case_1, the function returns -1.
- In Case_2, the function returns the maximum of 0 and the difference between `r` and `l`, where `r` is the minimum of its original value and `rr`, and `l` is the maximum of its original value and `ll`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept four integers `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr` and return either -1 or the maximum of 0 and the adjusted difference between `r` and `l` based on the specified conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters `l`, `r`, `ll`, and `rr`. It returns -1 in Case_1, and in Case_2, it returns the maximum of 0 and the difference between `r` and `l`, where `r` is the minimum of its original value and `rr`, and `l` is the maximum of its original value and `ll`.**
