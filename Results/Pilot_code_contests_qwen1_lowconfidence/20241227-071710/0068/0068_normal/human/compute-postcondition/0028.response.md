Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `h > 0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `h` has been decremented by 1.
- Therefore, before the current iteration, `h` was 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Value of `h`:**
   - Let's denote the value of `h` at the end of the previous iteration as \( h_{prev} \).
   - At the start of the current iteration, `h` was \( h_{prev} + 1 \).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as \( h > 0 \).
   - For the loop to continue, \( h_{prev} + 1 > 0 \).

3. **Adjusting `h`:**
   - Since `h` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `h` after the current iteration will be \( h_{prev} \).
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, \( h_{prev} \) must be greater than 0.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The values of `m1`, `m2`, `p`, `q`, `ans`, `l`, and `r` do not affect the loop condition directly. They only influence the logic inside the loop but do not change the loop condition.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `h` is greater than 0 at the start of the current iteration. Since `h` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, `h` must have been 1 in the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`h` must be greater than 0**
