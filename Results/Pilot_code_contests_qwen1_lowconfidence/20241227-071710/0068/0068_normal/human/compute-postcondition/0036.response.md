The code `l = m1` updates the value of `l` to be the same as `m1`. The other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:

- `h` remains 1
- `m1` is `l + (r - l) / 3`
- `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`
- `p` is `f(m1, a)`
- `q` is `f(m2, a)`
- `ans` is `min(p, q, ans)`
- `l` is now equal to `m1`

Output State: **`h` is 1, `m1` is `l + (r - l) / 3`, `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`, `p` is `f(m1, a)`, `q` is `f(m2, a)`, `ans` is `min(p, q, ans)`, `l` is `m1`**
