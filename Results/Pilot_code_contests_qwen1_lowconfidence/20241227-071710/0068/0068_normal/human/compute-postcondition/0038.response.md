Output State: **`h` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `f(l, a)` and `f(r, a)`, `l` is the lower bound of the search interval, `r` is the upper bound of the search interval, `m1` is `l + (r - l) / 3`, `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`, `p` is `f(m1, a)`, `q` is `f(m2, a)`**

### Explanation:
- **`h`**: The loop continues until `h` becomes 0. After `h` decrements to 0, the loop condition `h > 0` fails, and the loop terminates.
- **`ans`**: `ans` keeps track of the minimum value found during the iterations. It is updated whenever a new minimum value (`p` or `q`) is encountered.
- **`l` and `r`**: These variables define the bounds of the search interval. Initially, `l` is `-100005` and `r` is `100005`. The loop adjusts these bounds based on the comparison of `p` and `q` to converge on the optimal value.
- **`m1` and `m2`**: These are the midpoints used to divide the search interval into thirds. They are recalculated in each iteration.
- **`p` and `q`**: These are the function evaluations at `m1` and `m2`, respectively, using the input `a`.

After the loop completes, `l` and `r` will be very close to each other, with `l` being the lower bound and `r` being the upper bound of the final search interval. The minimum value between `f(l, a)` and `f(r, a)` is stored in `ans`.
