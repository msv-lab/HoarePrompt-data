The code appends the integer value of `x % 2` to the list `v`. Given the initial state where `x` is 1 and `v` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1, 1]`, the value of `x % 2` is 1 (since 1 % 2 equals 1). This value is appended to `v`. Thus, `v` will become either `[0, 0, 1]` or `[1, 1, 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is 1; `v` is either [0, 0, 1] or [1, 1, 1]**
