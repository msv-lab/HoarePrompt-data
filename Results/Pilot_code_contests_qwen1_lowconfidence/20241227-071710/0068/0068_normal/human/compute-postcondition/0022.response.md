Output State: **`x` is 0, `v` is a binary string, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of '1's in `v`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each bit position in the binary string `v`.
- If the bit at position `i` is '1', `2 ** i` is appended to the list `ans`.
- After all iterations, `ans` will contain all the powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of '1's in `v`.
- The value of `x` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `v` remains unchanged as it is only read during the loop iterations.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `v` is an empty string), then `ans` will remain an empty list.
