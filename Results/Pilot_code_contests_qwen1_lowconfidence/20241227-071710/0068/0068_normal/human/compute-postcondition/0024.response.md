The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, it returns a list `ans` containing the powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of '1's in the binary string representation of `x`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept a positive integer `x`, convert it to its binary string representation, identify the positions of '1's, and return a list of powers of 2 corresponding to those positions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, a positive integer, and returns a list `ans` containing the powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of '1's in the binary string representation of `x`.**
