The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans` without changing its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`h` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `f(l, a)` and `f(r, a)`, `l` is the lower bound of the search interval, `r` is the upper bound of the search interval, `m1` is `l + (r - l) / 3`, `m2` is `r - (r - l) / 3`, `p` is `f(m1, a)`, `q` is `f(m2, a)`**
