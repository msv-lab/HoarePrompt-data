You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. 

Determine a real number x such that the weakness of the sequence a1 - x, a2 - x, ..., an - x is as small as possible.

The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum value of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence.

The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000), the length of a sequence.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 10 000).

Output

Output a real number denoting the minimum possible weakness of a1 - x, a2 - x, ..., an - x. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.

Examples

Input

3
1 2 3


Output

1.000000000000000


Input

4
1 2 3 4


Output

2.000000000000000


Input

10
1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6


Output

4.500000000000000

Note

For the first case, the optimal value of x is 2 so the sequence becomes  - 1, 0, 1 and the max poorness occurs at the segment "-1" or segment "1". The poorness value (answer) equals to 1 in this case. 

For the second sample the optimal value of x is 2.5 so the sequence becomes  - 1.5, - 0.5, 0.5, 1.5 and the max poorness occurs on segment "-1.5 -0.5" or "0.5 1.5". The poorness value (answer) equals to 2 in this case.
Program:
```
def func_9(n, mod):
    global fac
    fac.append(1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        fac.append(fac[i - 1] * i % mod)
    f = fac[:]
    return f
```
