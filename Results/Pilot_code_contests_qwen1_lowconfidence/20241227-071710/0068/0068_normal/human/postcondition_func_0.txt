The function `func_1` takes no parameters and returns a map object containing integer values split from the string returned by `func_3()`. The function reads a string output from `func_3()`, splits it into individual elements using spaces as delimiters, converts each element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. Potential edge cases include: (1) `func_3()` returning an empty string, resulting in an empty map; (2) `func_3()` returning a string with multiple consecutive spaces, which would still be treated as single delimiters; (3) `func_3()` returning a string with non-integer values, which would result in a ValueError when attempting to convert them to integers. In such cases, those invalid conversions would raise an error.
