- The function correctly handles the case where there is no overlap and returns -1.
- The function correctly adjusts `l` and `r` based on `ll` and `rr` when there is an overlap.
- However, the annotation mentions that `ll` and `rr` should satisfy `ll <= rr` and `ll <= r` and `rr >= l` after the adjustments, which is not strictly enforced by the code. The code only updates `l` and `r` based on `ll` and `rr`, but it does not explicitly ensure these conditions hold. Therefore, after the function executes, `ll` and `rr` will still satisfy their initial conditions, but `l` and `r` might not necessarily satisfy `ll <= r` and `rr >= l` due to the nature of the operations performed.
