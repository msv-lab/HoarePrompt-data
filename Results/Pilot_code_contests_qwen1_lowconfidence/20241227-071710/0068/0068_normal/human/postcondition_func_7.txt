The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `x` and returns a list `ans` containing the powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of '1's in the binary string representation of `x`. Specifically, the function first constructs the binary representation of `x` in the list `v`. Then, it iterates over `v` to find positions where the value is 1, and calculates the corresponding power of 2, appending these values to the list `ans`. The function handles the case where `x` is a positive integer, and correctly computes the binary representation and the resulting list of powers of 2. Potential edge cases include when `x` is 0, in which case `v` would be an empty list, and thus `ans` would also be an empty list. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; it correctly implements the described behavior.
