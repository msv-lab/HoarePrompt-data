The function `func_4()` prompts the user to input an integer and returns it. There are no parameters required for this function. If the user inputs something that is not an integer, the program will raise a `ValueError`. No error handling is explicitly provided for non-integer inputs, so the function will repeatedly prompt the user until a valid integer is entered.
