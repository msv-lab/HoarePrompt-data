The function `f` accepts two parameters: `x`, a real number, and `a`, a list of integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000` and each integer `ai` satisfies `|ai| ≤ 10,000`. It calculates the sum `b` for each element in the list `a` subtracted by `x`. During the iteration, it keeps track of the maximum (`mx`) and minimum (`mi`) values of `b` including a minimum of `b` and `0` at each step. After completing the iteration, it returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values found.
