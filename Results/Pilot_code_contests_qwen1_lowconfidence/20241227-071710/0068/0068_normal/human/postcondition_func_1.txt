The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by calling another function `func_3`, which presumably reads input and returns a string. This string is then split into a list of substrings using `.split()`. Each substring is converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and the resulting map object is converted to a list. The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur during the conversion process, such as non-numeric values in the input string. Potential edge cases include `func_3` returning an empty string or a string with no numeric values, in which case the returned list would be empty. Additionally, if `func_3` returns a string containing non-numeric values, the conversion to integers will raise a `ValueError`, which is not caught or handled within `func_2`.
