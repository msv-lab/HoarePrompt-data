Let's analyze the loop step-by-step based on the provided output states and the loop code:

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` contains at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`.
- `i` is 200010.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Code Analysis:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    if lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]:
        lmn[i] = lmn[i + 1]
```

### Understanding the Loop:
The loop iterates over the range `[0, 200008]` (since `i` starts at 200010 and goes down to 0). For each iteration, it checks if `lmn[i]` is less than `lmn[i + 1]`. If so, it updates `lmn[i]` to be equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.

### Observations from Provided Output States:
- After 1 iteration: `lmn[i]` equals `lmn[i + 1]` if `lmn[i]` was originally less than `lmn[i + 1]`.
- After 2 iterations: `lmn[i - 1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.
- After 3 iterations: `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`, and `lmn[i + 1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 2]`.

From these observations, we can infer that the loop continues to update the elements in `lmn` such that `lmn[i]` becomes equal to `lmn[i + 1]` whenever the condition `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]` is met. This process propagates backward through the array.

### Final State Analysis:
After the loop completes its iterations, the array `lmn` will be such that for every index `i` from `0` to `200007`, `lmn[i]` will be equal to `lmn[200008]` (which is the last element in the array).

### Final Output State:
- `lmn` will be a constant array where all elements from `0` to `200007` are equal to `lmn[200008]`.
- `i` will be 0 (since the loop stops when `i` reaches 0).
- `ans` remains unchanged and is still 0.

Thus, the final output state of the loop is:

**Output State: **`lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`, `i` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**
