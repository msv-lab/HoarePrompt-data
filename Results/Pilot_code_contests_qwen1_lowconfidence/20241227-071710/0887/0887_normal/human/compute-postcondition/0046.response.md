The code `lmx[i + 1] = lmx[i]` updates the element at index `i + 1` in the list `lmx` to be the same as the element at index `i`. Given that `i` is 2, the code updates `lmx[3]` (since indexing starts at 0) to be the same as `lmx[2]`. Since `lmx` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, this change will reflect in both `lmx` and `rmx`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 2.

After the code execution:
- `lmx` and `rmx` will have their fourth element (`lmx[3]` and `rmx[3]`) updated to be the same as the third element (`lmx[2]` and `rmx[2]`).

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 2, `lmx[3]` is equal to `lmx[2]`, `rmx[3]` is equal to `rmx[2]`**
