Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
   - `i` is 200009.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from 200009 down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time (`xrange(200009, 0, -1)`).

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `lmx[i + 1]` is equal to `lmx[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 200008.
   - If the condition is met, then `lmn[200009]` is set to the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a`, `lmx` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to 200009.

4. **Ensuring Loop Execution**:
   - To ensure the loop starts and runs successfully, we need to make sure the initial value of `i` (which is 200009) is valid and meets the loop condition.
   - Since the loop runs from 200009 down to 1, `i` being 200009 ensures the loop will start.
   - However, we need to ensure that the condition `lmx[i + 1] == lmx[i]` holds true for all `i` from 0 to 200008, or else the loop will stop before reaching `i = 0`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The key states to adjust are `a` (to ensure it contains tuples), `lmn` and `lmx` (to ensure they are correctly set up), and the initial value of `i` (which is already 200009 and will start the loop).

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- Ensure `a` contains at least one tuple.
- Ensure `lmn` and `lmx` are correctly set up.
- Ensure `i` is 200009.

Since the loop will only continue if the condition `lmx[i + 1] == lmx[i]` holds true for all `i` from 0 to 200008, we need to verify this condition as well, but it doesn't affect the initial state directly. We just need to ensure the loop can start.

So, the final state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009**.
