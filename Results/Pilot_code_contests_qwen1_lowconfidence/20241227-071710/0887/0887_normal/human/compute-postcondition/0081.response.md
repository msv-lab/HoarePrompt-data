Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is `200010` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`, and for every index `j` in the range `[0, 200008]`, `lmn[j]` is equal to `rmn[j]`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: `a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is `1` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 200009`.
  - For each iteration, the condition `if lmn[i] < rmn[i]:` is checked.
  - If the condition is true, `lmn[i]` is updated to `rmn[i]`.
  - Since `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `lmn[i]` will eventually become equal to `rmn[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, 200008]`.

- **Final State**:
  - After the loop completes, `i` will be `200010` (since the loop iterates up to `200009` inclusive).
  - All elements in `lmn` from index `0` to `200008` will be equal to the corresponding elements in `rmn`.
  - Therefore, for every index `j` in the range `[0, 200008]`, `lmn[j]` is equal to `rmn[j]`.

This ensures that the final state of `lmn` matches `rmn` for all relevant indices.
