According to the given code, the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 200009. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `a` contains at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`.
- All other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`.
- `i` is within the range [0, 200009].
- For every index `j` in the range [0, 200008], `lmn[j]` is equal to `rmn[j]`.
- If `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmx[i]` is now equal to `rmx[i]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the value of `i` as \( i_{prev} \). The loop condition `i < 200010` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute again. Therefore, \( i_{prev} \) must be less than 200009 for the loop to continue.

To proceed to the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, making the new value of `i` equal to \( i_{prev} + 1 \).

Given that no other variables (`lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`) are modified within the loop body based on the provided information, their values remain unchanged.

Thus, the updated states are:
- `a` still contains at least one tuple.
- `lmn` remains unchanged.
- `lmx` remains unchanged.
- `rmn` remains a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx[0]` is still the maximum value in `rmx`.
- All other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are still `rmx[0]`.
- `i` is now \( i_{prev} + 1 \), where \( i_{prev} \) is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and is less than 200009.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`, and `i` is within the range [1, 200010]**.
