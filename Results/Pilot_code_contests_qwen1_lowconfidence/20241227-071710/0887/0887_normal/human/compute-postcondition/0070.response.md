Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    if rmx[i - 1] < rmx[i]:
        rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `200008` down to `1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `rmx[i - 1]` is less than `rmx[i]`.
   - If true, it updates `rmx[i - 1]` to `rmx[i]`.

2. **Effect on `rmx`:**
   - This operation ensures that `rmx[i - 1]` is always the maximum of `rmx[i - 1]` and `rmx[i]`.
   - After the loop completes, `rmx[0]` will be the maximum value among all elements in `rmx`.

3. **Final State of `rmx`:**
   - After the loop completes, `rmx[0]` will be the maximum value in `rmx`.
   - All other elements in `rmx` (from `rmx[1]` to `rmx[200008]`) will be equal to `rmx[0]`.

4. **State of Other Variables:**
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
   - `i` will be `1` after the loop since the loop starts from `200009` and decrements by `1` until `1`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes, the following conditions hold:
- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`.
- `i` is `1`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is 1.**
