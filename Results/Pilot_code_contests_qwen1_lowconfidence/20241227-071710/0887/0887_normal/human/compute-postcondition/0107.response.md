The code `lmx[i] = lmx[i + 1]` updates the value of `lmx[i]` to be equal to the value of `lmx[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means `lmx[1]` will now be equal to `lmx[2]`.

The initial state of `lmn` being an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]` does not affect the specific elements mentioned in the code snippet, so the precondition remains unchanged for the array `lmn`. The variable `i` is updated to 2 after this assignment since `i` was incremented implicitly by the operation (it was originally 1 and is now set to `i + 1`). The variable `ans` remains unchanged at 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, and `lmx[1]` is equal to `lmx[2]`.**
