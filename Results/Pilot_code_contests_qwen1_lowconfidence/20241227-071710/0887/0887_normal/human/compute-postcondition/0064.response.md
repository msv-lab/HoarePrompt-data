Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `200009` to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means the loop starts at `200009` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`.

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `rmx[i - 1]` is equal to `rmx[i]`, the state of `rmx` and `i` will be updated. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged and `i` stays at `1`.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since `i` is currently `1`, the loop will check the condition `rmx[i - 1] == rmx[i]`, which simplifies to checking `rmx[0] == rmx[1]` because `i - 1` is `0`.
   - If `rmx[0]` is not equal to `rmx[1]`, the state remains unchanged, and `i` stays at `1`.
   - If `rmx[0]` is equal to `rmx[1]`, then `rmx` and `i` will be updated, but since this information is not provided, we assume no change in state.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the initial state and the loop condition, if the condition `rmx[0] == rmx[1]` is not met, `i` will still be `1` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same unless specified otherwise. Since no changes are mentioned, we conclude that `i` remains `1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1.**
