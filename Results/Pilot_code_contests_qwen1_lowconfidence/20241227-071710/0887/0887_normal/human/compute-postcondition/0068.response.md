`rmx[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `rmx[i]`. Given that `i` is 200008, `i - 1` is 200007. Therefore, `rmx[200007]` is now equal to `rmx[200008]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[200007]` is equal to `rmx[200008]`, and `i` is 200008.**
