Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009; if `lmn[200010]` is greater than `lmn[200009]`, the values of `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.***
