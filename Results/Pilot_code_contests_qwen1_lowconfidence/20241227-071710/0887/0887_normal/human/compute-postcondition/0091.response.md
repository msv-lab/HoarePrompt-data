Postcondition: ***`a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` from index 1 to 200008 are equal to `rmx[0]; i` is `i_current + 1`. If `lmx[i]` is greater than `rmx[i]`, then no change occurs. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above.***
