`lmn[i]` is assigned the value of `lmn[i + 1]`. The initial condition that `i` is within the range [0, 200008] and `lmn[i]` is less than `lmn[i + 1]` remains valid.

Output State: **`i` is within the range [0, 200008]; `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`; `lmn[i + 1]` is greater than `lmn[i]` (since `lmn[i]` was originally less than `lmn[i + 1]` and now `lmn[i]` equals `lmn[i + 1]`).**
