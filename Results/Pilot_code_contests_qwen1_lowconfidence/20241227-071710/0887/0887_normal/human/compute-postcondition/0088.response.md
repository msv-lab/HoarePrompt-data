Postcondition: ***`a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`. If `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmx[i]` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the condition `lmx[i] > rmx[i]` is the only one that affects the postcondition, and thus, `lmx[i]` remains `rmx[0]` in this case.***
