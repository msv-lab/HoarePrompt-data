The given code snippet does not include the definition of `func_1`, which means its behavior cannot be determined without this information. However, based on the provided initial state and the operations performed, we can infer the structure of the lists `s[0]` and `s[1]`.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `dat` is a map object containing exactly `2 * n` elements.
   - `s` is a list where each sublist `s[0]` and `s[1]` contains exactly `n` elements. Each element in `s[x + y & 1]` is of the form `(-x + y, x + y)` where `x` is the value at key `i * 2` in `dat` and `y` is the value at key `i * 2 + 1` in `dat`, and `i` ranges from `0` to `n - 1`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code computes `func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1])`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, let's assume that `func_1` operates on the elements of the list and returns a numeric value. 

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The values of `n`, `dat`, and `s` remain unchanged because no assignments are made to these variables within the given code snippet.
   - The function `func_1` is called twice, once for `s[0]` and once for `s[1]`, and their results are added together.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is unknown, we cannot determine the specific numerical result. However, we know the structure of `s[0]` and `s[1]` and that the values within these lists are derived from the keys in `dat`.

Given this, the output state will reflect that `func_1` has been called on `s[0]` and `s[1]`, and their results have been summed up. But since the exact computation depends on `func_1`, we cannot provide a more detailed numerical output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `dat` is a map object containing exactly `2 * n` elements; `s` is a list where each sublist `s[0]` and `s[1]` contains exactly `n` elements; `func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1])` has been computed.**
