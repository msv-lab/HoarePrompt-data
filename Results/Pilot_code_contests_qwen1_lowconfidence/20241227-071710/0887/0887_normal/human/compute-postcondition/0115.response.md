To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step by step.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200008 (inclusive) using `i` as the index. In each iteration, it checks if `lmx[i]` is greater than `lmx[i + 1]`. If this condition is true, it sets `lmx[i]` to `lmx[i + 1]`.

### Initial State
- `lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`.
- `i` is 0.
- `ans` is 0.

### Observations from Provided Output States
1. **After 1 iteration:**
   - `lmn` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `lmx[1]` is equal to `lmx[2]`.

2. **After 2 iterations:**
   - `lmn` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `lmx[3]` is compared with `lmx[4]`.
   - If `lmx[3]` is greater than `lmx[4]`, no change is made to `lmx[3]`.
   - Otherwise, no change is made to `lmx[3]`.

3. **After 3 iterations:**
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - If `lmx[4]` is greater than `lmx[5]`, no change is made to `lmx[4]`.
   - Otherwise, no change is made to `lmx[4]`.

### General Pattern
- The loop compares adjacent elements of `lmx` and ensures that each element is less than or equal to its next element.
- After the loop completes, `lmx` will be a non-increasing sequence starting from `lmx[200008]` and ending at `lmx[0]`.

### Final Output State
After all 200009 iterations, the array `lmx` will be transformed into a non-increasing sequence. Specifically, `lmx[200008]` will be the largest element, and `lmx[0]` will be the smallest element.

Since `lmn` is initially set to be equal to `lmn[200008]` and no modifications are made to `lmn` inside the loop, `lmn` will remain unchanged.

### Conclusion
- `lmn` remains an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`.
- `i` is 200009 after the loop completes.
- `ans` remains 0 since it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: **`lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`, `i` is 200009, and `ans` is 0. `lmx` is a non-increasing sequence starting from `lmn[200008]` and ending at `lmx[0]`.**
