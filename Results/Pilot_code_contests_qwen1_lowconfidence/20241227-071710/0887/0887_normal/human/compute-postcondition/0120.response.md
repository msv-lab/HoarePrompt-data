According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200008 inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 200008. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 200009.

Since the loop is iterating up to 200008, once `i` reaches 200009, the loop will terminate. Therefore, there are no additional state adjustments needed for the variables `ans`, `lmx`, or `lmn` as they are not dependent on the loop's iteration count directly within the given context.

State: **`i` is 200009**
