According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from 200009 down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 200009.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 and become 200008.

Let's break it down:

- `a` must contain at least one tuple (unchanged).
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is initially 200009.

After the last iteration, `i` is 200009. For the loop to continue, `i` must be set to 200008.

The condition inside the loop (if `rmn[200008]` is greater than `rmn[200009]`, update `rmn[200008]`) will be checked in the next iteration, but this does not affect the loop continuation itself.

State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200008**.
