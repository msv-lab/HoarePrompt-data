The code `lmn[i] = rmn[i]` assigns the value of `rmn[i]` to `lmn[i]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements from `1` to `200008` are also `rmx[0]`.
- `i` is `1` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`.
- The condition `lmn[i] < rmn[i]` is true.

After executing the code, `lmn[i]` will be updated to `rmn[i]`. Since `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmn[i]` is the same as `lmn[i]` before the assignment. However, the value of `lmn[i]` will now match the value of `rmn[i]`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is `1` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`, and `lmn[i]` is now equal to `rmn[i]` (which was originally `lmn[i]` but is now updated).**
