The code `lmn[i + 1] = lmn[i]` updates the element at index `i + 1` in the list `lmn` to be the same as the element at index `i`. Given that `i` is 200009, this means `lmn[200010]` is now equal to `lmn[200009]`. 

All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions are preserved except for the specified change in `lmn`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009; `lmn[200010]` is equal to `lmn[200009]`.**
