Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `dat` is a map object containing exactly `2 * n` elements.
   - `x` is the value at key `i * 2` in `dat`.
   - `y` is the value at key `i * 2 + 1` in `dat`.
   - `s` has a new element appended to the list at index `0` or `1` based on the parity of `x + y`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
   - `x` is set to the value at key `i * 2` in `dat`.
   - `y` is set to the value at key `i * 2 + 1` in `dat`.
   - A new element is appended to the list `s` based on the parity of `x + y`.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop condition checks if `i < n`, the loop will execute again as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will become `n`.

5. **Updated Values:**
   - `x` will now be the value at key `n * 2` in `dat`.
   - `y` will now be the value at key `n * 2 + 1` in `dat`.
   - A new element will be appended to `s` based on the parity of `x + y`.

Given this analysis, we need to update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be `n` (since `i` is incremented by 1).
- `x` will be the value at key `n * 2` in `dat`.
- `y` will be the value at key `n * 2 + 1` in `dat`.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: `n` is a positive integer; `dat` is a map object containing exactly `2 * n` elements; `x` is the value at key `n * 2` in `dat`; `y` is the value at key `n * 2 + 1` in `dat`; `s` has a new element appended to the list at index `0` or `1` based on the parity of `x + y`.**
