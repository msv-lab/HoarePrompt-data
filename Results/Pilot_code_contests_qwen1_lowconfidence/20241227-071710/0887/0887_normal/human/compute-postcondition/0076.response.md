The code `lmn[i] = rmn[i]` updates the value of `lmn[i]` to be equal to `rmn[i]`. Given the precondition that `lmn[i]` is already equal to `rmxn[i]`, this assignment does not change the values of `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`.

Other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is `2` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`, and `lmn[i]` is now equal to `rmn[i]`.**
