To determine the necessary adjustments for the given for loop to execute, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Initial States:
- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Execution Conditions:
- The loop runs from 200009 to 0 (inclusive) with a step of -1.
- Inside the loop, the condition `rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]` is checked.
- If the condition holds for any `i` from 200008 to 1, no changes are made to `rmn` and `rmx`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - Given `i` is initially set to 1, this means the loop will start its first iteration with `i = 1`.
   - For the loop to start, we only need to ensure that `i` is within the range of the loop, which is from 200009 to 0.

2. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The condition `rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]` needs to be evaluated for each `i` from 200008 to 1.
   - Since `i` starts at 1, the first check would be for `i = 1`, which corresponds to checking `rmn[0]` and `rmn[1]`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is within the correct range when the loop starts, which it is since `i` is 1.
   - No additional constraints on `rmn` or `lmn` are needed based on the given conditions, as they only check if `rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]` for `i` from 200008 to 1, and no changes are made if this condition holds.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1.**

Since `i` is already 1 and the loop will start iterating from there, no further adjustments to `rmn` or other states are required based on the given conditions.
