According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200009 (since `xrange(200010)` includes indices from 0 to 200009). The loop body is omitted, but we need to determine how the loop affects the states of `a`, `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `a` contains at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`.
- All other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`.
- If `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmx[i]` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the condition `lmx[i] > rmx[i]` is the only one that affects the postcondition, and thus, `lmx[i]` remains `rmx[0]` in this case.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be incremented from its current value. Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. The loop will execute one more time if `i_current < 200010`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_current`, we can say that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_current + 1`. The conditions for `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` remain the same unless the loop body changes them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no change to these variables.

Therefore, the states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`. `i` is `i_current + 1`.**
