Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. If `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]`, then no changes are made to `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx`. Otherwise, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.***
