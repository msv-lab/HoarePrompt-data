The code `rmn = lmn[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `lmn` and assigns it to the variable `rmn`. This does not modify the original values of `a`, `x`, `lmn[x]`, or `lmx[x]`. The values of `lmn[x]` and `lmx[x]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is equal to \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\), `lmn[x]` is the maximum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that `lmn[x] < y`, `lmx[x]` is the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that `lmn[x] > y`, and `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.**
