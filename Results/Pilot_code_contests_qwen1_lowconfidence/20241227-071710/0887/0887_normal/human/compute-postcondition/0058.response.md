Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least one tuple. `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged. `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` with its element at index 200007 set to the element at index 200008. `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. If `rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]`, `rmn` and `rmx` maintain the relationship where `rmn[200007] > rmn[200008]` and `i` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `rmn` and `rmx`, and `i` is 1.***
