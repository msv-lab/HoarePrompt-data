According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 200009. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` is 0, and `a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, and `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 200009. Therefore, we increment `i` by 1 to make it 1.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must still contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` must still be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`.
- `rmn` is still a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is still a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is now 1.

State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1**
