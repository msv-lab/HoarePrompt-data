`lmx[i]` is assigned the value of `rmx[i]`. Given that `rmx[i]` is `rmx[0]` (since all elements from 1 to 200008 in `rmx` are `rmx[0]`), the value of `lmx[i]` becomes `rmx[0]`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`, `lmx[i]` is `rmx[0]`, and `i` is within the range [1, 200010]**
