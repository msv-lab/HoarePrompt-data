The code assigns the value of `rmx[i]` to `lmx[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `a` contains at least one tuple, which is not directly affected by this line of code.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` from index 1 to 200008 are also equal to `rmx[0]`.
- `i` is `i_current + 1`.

After executing `lmx[i] = rmx[i]`:

- The value of `lmx[i]` is now equal to `rmx[i]`.
- Since `rmx[i]` is the same as `rmx[0]` (the maximum value in `rmx`), `lmx[i]` is also the maximum value in `rmx`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` from index 1 to 200008 are also equal to `rmx[0]`.
- `i` is `i_current + 1`.
- `lmx[i]` is the maximum value in `rmx`.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` from index 1 to 200008 are also equal to `rmx[0]; i` is `i_current + 1; lmx[i]` is the maximum value in `rmx`.**
