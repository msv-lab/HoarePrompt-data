Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` are initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 1.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 200008` (inclusive) because `range(200009)` generates numbers from `0` to `200008`.
2. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be set to `2`.

### Adjusted States:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` should now be `2`.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged because they are based on the tuples in `a` and are not modified within the loop.
- `rmn` and `rmx` are shallow copies of `lmn` and `lmx`, respectively, and remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop.
- There is no indication that the loop modifies `a`, `lmn`, or `lmx` directly in the given information.

### Final State:
- `a` must still contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` and `rmx` remain unchanged.
- `i` is now `2`.

### Answer:
State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 2**.
