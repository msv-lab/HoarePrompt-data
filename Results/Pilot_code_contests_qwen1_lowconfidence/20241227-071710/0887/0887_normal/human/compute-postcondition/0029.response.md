The code assigns the value of `lmn[i]` to `lmn[i + 1]`. Given the precondition that `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]` is true, after executing this line, the inequality will no longer hold since `lmn[i + 1]` is now equal to `lmn[i]`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, and `lmn[i + 1] == lmn[i]`.**
