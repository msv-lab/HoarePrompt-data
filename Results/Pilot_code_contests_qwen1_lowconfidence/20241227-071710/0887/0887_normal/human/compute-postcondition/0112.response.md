Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `lmx[3]` is compared with `lmx[4]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `range(200009)`, meaning `i` ranges from 0 to 200008 inclusive.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Array Comparisons:**
   - The problem mentions a comparison between `lmx[3]` and `lmx[4]`.
   - No change is made to `ans` based on this comparison.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the only change needed is in the value of `i`, we update `i` to 4.
   - The value of `lmn`, `ans`, and the comparison condition remain unchanged as per the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`; `i` is 4; `ans` is 0; `lmx[3]` is compared with `lmx[4]`. If `lmx[3]` is greater than `lmx[4]`, no change is made to `ans`. If `lmx[3]` is not greater than `lmx[4]`, no change is made to `ans`.**
