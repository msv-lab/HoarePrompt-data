`rmx[i - 1]` is assigned the value of `rmx[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `rmx[0]` is assigned the value of `rmx[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is updated such that `rmx[0]` is now equal to `rmx[1]`, `i` is 1.
