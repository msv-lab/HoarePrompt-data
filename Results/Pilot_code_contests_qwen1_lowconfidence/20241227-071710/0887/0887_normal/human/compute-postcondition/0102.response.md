`lmn[i]` is assigned the value of `lmn[i + 1]`. According to the initial state, `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`, which is also equal to `lmn[i + 2]`. After executing the code, the value of `lmn[i]` becomes the same as the current value of `lmn[i + 1]`, which is already equal to `lmn[i]`. Therefore, the values of `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]` remain the same, and `lmn[i + 1]` is still equal to `lmn[i + 2]`.

Output State: **`lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmn[i + 1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 2]`**
