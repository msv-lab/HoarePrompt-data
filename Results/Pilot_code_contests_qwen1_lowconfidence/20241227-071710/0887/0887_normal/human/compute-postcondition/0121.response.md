`ans` is incremented by the value of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2`. Since the initial state of `i` is 200009, the value of `i` remains unchanged. However, the value of `ans` is updated based on the expression provided.

Output State: **`i` is 200009; `ans` is updated by adding `(lmx[200009] - lmn[200009]) / 2` to its current value**
