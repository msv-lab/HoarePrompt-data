The code `x, y = dat[i * 2:i * 2 + 2]` extracts the values of keys `i * 2` and `i * 2 + 1` from the map object `dat` and assigns them to `x` and `y`, respectively. Given that `i` is incremented to `n` at the start of the next iteration, we need to update the values of `x` and `y` to reflect these new keys.

From the initial state:
- `x` was the value at key `i * 2` in `dat`.
- `y` was the value at key `i * 2 + 1` in `dat`.

After incrementing `i` to `n`, the new values will be:
- `x` is now the value at key `n * 2` in `dat`.
- `y` is now the value at key `n * 2 + 1` in `dat`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are as follows:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `dat` remains a map object containing exactly `2 * n` elements.
- `x` is now the value at key `n * 2` in `dat`.
- `y` is now the value at key `n * 2 + 1` in `dat`.
- `s` has a new element appended to the list at index `0` or `1` based on the parity of `x + y`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `dat` is a map object containing exactly `2 * n` elements; `x` is the value at key `n * 2` in `dat`; `y` is the value at key `n * 2 + 1` in `dat`; `s` has a new element appended to the list at index `0` or `1` based on the parity of `x + y`.**
