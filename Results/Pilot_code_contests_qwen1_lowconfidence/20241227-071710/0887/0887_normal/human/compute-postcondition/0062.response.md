The code `rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]` updates the value of `rmx[i - 1]` to be the same as the value of `rmx[i]`. Given the precondition that `rmx[i - 1]` is currently less than `rmx[i]`, after executing this line, `rmx[i - 1]` will be equal to `rmx[i]`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1, and the current value of `rmx[i - 1]` is equal to the current value of `rmx[i]`**
