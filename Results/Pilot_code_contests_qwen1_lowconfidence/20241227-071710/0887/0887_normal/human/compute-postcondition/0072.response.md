Postcondition: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is `1` and must be within the range [0, 200009]. The condition `lmn[i] < rmn[i]` is true.**
