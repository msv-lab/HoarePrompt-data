Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1. If `rmx[i - 1]` is equal to `rmx[i]`, the postcondition remains as is. Otherwise, the function does not change the state of `rmx` and `i` remains 1.***
