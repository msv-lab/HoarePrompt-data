The code `lmx[i] = lmx[i + 1]` updates the value of `lmx[i]` to be the same as `lmx[i + 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is 0
- `lmx[1]` is equal to `lmx[2]`

Let's analyze the impact:

1. `lmx[i]` is updated to be equal to `lmx[i + 1]`.
2. Since `i` is 3, `lmx[3]` is updated to be equal to `lmx[4]`.

Given that `lmx[1]` is equal to `lmx[2]`, the value of `lmx[4]` would depend on the value of `lmx[3]`, which is not specified in the initial state. However, since no specific value is given for `lmx[3]` or `lmx[4]`, we'll keep them as they are in terms of their relationship to each other.

The output state will be:

- `lmn` remains unchanged: all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`
- `i` is still 3
- `ans` is still 0
- `lmx[3]` is now equal to `lmx[4]`
- `lmx[1]` is still equal to `lmx[2]`

Output State: **`lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`; `i` is 3; `ans` is 0; `lmx[3]` is equal to `lmx[4]`; `lmx[1]` is equal to `lmx[2]`**
