According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 200008 (inclusive). The loop condition for the `for i in xrange(200009)` ensures that the loop will execute 200009 times.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `ans` is 0.
- `lmx[1]` is equal to `lmx[2]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2.
- Therefore, `i` will be 3.
- Since the loop will continue as long as `i < 200009`, and `i` is now 3, the loop can execute again.

No changes are needed for `lmn`, `ans`, or `lmx` since the problem does not indicate that these variables change within the loop body based on the given information.

State: **`lmn` is an array where all elements from 0 to 200007 are equal to `lmn[200008]`, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, and `lmx[1]` is equal to `lmx[2]`.**
