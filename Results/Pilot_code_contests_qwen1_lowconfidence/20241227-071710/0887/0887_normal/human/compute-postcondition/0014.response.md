The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `stdin`, which is an object providing input data access. The function processes the input data through `stdin` to read the coordinates of the black tokens, where each coordinate pair `(x, y)` is provided for each black token, and these coordinates satisfy the constraints `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `-10^5 <= x, y <= 10^5`. The initial positions of black tokens are distinct.

Given the output cases provided, it seems there might be some misunderstanding since no explicit return statement was given. Based on the description, the function processes the input but does not explicitly return any value. However, if we follow the format strictly, we can describe it as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer) and `stdin` (an input data access object). It reads coordinates from `stdin` for `n` black tokens and processes these coordinates.**
