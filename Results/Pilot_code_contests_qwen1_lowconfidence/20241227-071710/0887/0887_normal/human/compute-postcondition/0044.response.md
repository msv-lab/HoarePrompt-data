Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` are initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1. If `lmx[i + 1]` is less than `lmx[i]`, then `lmx[i + 1]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `lmx[i + 1]` remains unchanged as well.***
