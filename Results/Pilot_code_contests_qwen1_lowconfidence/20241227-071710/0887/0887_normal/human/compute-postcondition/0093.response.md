The given code initializes `ans` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`, and `i` is 200010; `ans` is 0.**
