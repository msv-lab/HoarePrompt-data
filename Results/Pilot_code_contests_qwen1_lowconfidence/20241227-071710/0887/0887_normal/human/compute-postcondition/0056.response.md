Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` with its element at index 200007 set to the element at index 200008.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
   - If `rmn[200007] > rmn[200008]`, then `rmn` and `rmx` maintain this relationship. Otherwise, no changes are made to `rmn` and `rmx`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `200009` down to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **What Changes in Each Iteration?**
   - The loop variable `i` decreases from `200009` to `1`.
   - No specific actions are mentioned inside the loop body other than possibly modifying `rmn` and `rmx` based on the condition.

4. **Current Loop Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs backwards from `200009` to `1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2` (assuming we started from `200009`).

5. **Next Loop Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `1`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
   - `rmn` and `rmx` may or may not change depending on the condition in the loop body. However, since no specific action is mentioned in the loop body, we assume no changes are made unless explicitly stated.
   - The only thing that changes is the loop variable `i`, which will be `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` with its element at index 200007 set to the element at index 200008, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, if `rmn[200007] > rmn[200008]`, then `rmn` and `rmx` maintain this relationship. Otherwise, no changes are made to `rmn` and `rmx`, and `i` is 1.**
