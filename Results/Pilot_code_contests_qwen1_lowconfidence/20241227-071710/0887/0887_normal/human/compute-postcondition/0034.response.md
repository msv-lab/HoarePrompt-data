Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 200009.
- If `lmn[200010]` is greater than `lmn[200009]`, the values of `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `0` to `200008` (inclusive) because `i` starts at `200009`.
- Each iteration of the loop checks if `lmn[200010]` is greater than `lmn[200009]`.
- If it is true, then `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged. If it is false, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged as well.
- Therefore, regardless of the condition, the values of `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged in each iteration.

### States to Adjust:
- Since the values of `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged in each iteration, there is no change to these variables.
- `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.
- The condition `lmn[200010] > lmn[200009]` remains unchanged.

### Updated State:
- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is still a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is still a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is now `200008`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200008**
