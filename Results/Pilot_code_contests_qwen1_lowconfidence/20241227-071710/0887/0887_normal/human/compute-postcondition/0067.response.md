According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is within the specified range. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:

- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is updated such that `rmx[0]` is now equal to `rmx[1]`.
- `i` is 1.

The loop will continue if `i` is in the range from 200009 down to 1, with a step of -1. Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is set to 200008 (the next value in the sequence before it becomes 0).

The other states (`a`, `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx`) remain unchanged.

State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is updated such that `rmx[0]` is now equal to `rmx[1]`, and `i` is 200008**.
