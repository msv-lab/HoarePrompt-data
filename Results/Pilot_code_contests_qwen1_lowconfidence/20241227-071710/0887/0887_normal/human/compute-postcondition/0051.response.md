The code assigns the value of `rmn[i]` to `rmn[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 200009, `rmn[i - 1]` was originally greater than `rmn[i]`. After the assignment, `rmn[i - 1]` will now have the same value as `rmn[i]`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` with the value of `rmn[200008]` equal to `rmn[200009]`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009**
