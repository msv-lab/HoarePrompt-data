`ans` is incremented by half the difference between `lmx[i]` and `lmn[i]`. The value of `i` is 200008, and the condition `lmn[i] < lmx[i]` is true. Therefore, `ans` is updated by `(lmx[200008] - lmn[200008]) / 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 200008; `ans` is increased by (lmx[200008] - lmn[200008]) / 2; `lmn[200008]` is less than `lmx[200008]`**
