The code assigns the value `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005` to `x`. Since `x` is initially undefined, it cannot be directly substituted. However, the equation `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005` indicates that `x` will be assigned a value derived from this expression. The value of `y` remains undefined, and the list `a` is not affected.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least two tuples, `x` is equal to `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`, `y` is undefined**
