Output State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`, and `i` is 200010. For every index `j` in the range [0, 200008], if `lmx[j] > rmx[j]` at any point during the loop execution, then `lmx[j]` is set to `rmx[j]`. Otherwise, `lmx[j]` remains unchanged and equals `rmx[0]`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initialization and Loop Conditions:**
  - The loop iterates over the range `[0, 200009]`.
  - Initially, `i` is set to `200010`, so the loop does not execute at the start.
  - `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
  - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, meaning both `lmn` and `rmn` initially refer to the same list of tuples.
  - `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from index 1 to 200008) are set to `rmx[0]`.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - For each iteration, the loop checks if `lmx[i]` is greater than `rmx[i]`.
  - If `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`, then `lmx[i]` is updated to `rmx[i]`.
  - If `lmx[i] <= rmx[i]`, then `lmx[i]` remains unchanged and is set to `rmx[0]`.

- **Post-loop State:**
  - After the loop completes, `i` will be `200010`.
  - The values in `lmx` will reflect the updates made during the loop based on the condition `lmx[i] > rmx[i]`.
  - If no updates were made to `lmx`, all elements in `lmx` will remain `rmx[0]`.
  - `lmn` and `rmn` still refer to the same list of tuples, and `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, with all other elements in `rmx` being `rmx[0]`.

Since the loop does not execute (as `i` starts at `200010`), the values of `lmx` and `rmx` will not change from their initial state, and the conditions stated above will hold true.
