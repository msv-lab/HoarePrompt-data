Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. After all iterations of the loop, `lmn[200009]` is the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` (since no further changes are made after the loop), `lmx` remains unchanged, and `i` is 200009.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `a` must contain at least one tuple.
  - `lmn[x]` is the maximum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that `lmn[x] < y`.
  - `lmx[x]` is the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that `lmn[x] > y`.
  - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
  - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
  - `x` is set to \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\).

- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for i in range(200009):
      if lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]:
          lmn[i + 1] = lmn[i]
  ```

- **Observations from the Output States**:
  - After each iteration, if `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]`, the value of `lmn[i + 1]` remains unchanged.
  - If the condition `lmn[i + 1] > lmn[i]` is never met during the loop, the values of `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.

- **Final State**:
  - Since the loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `200008`, and there are no changes made to `lmn` after the loop, the final value of `lmn[200009]` will be the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` (since `lmn` was initially set to the maximum value of `y` where `lmn[x] < y`, and no further changes are made).
  - The values of `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Thus, the final state after all iterations of the loop is:
- `lmn[200009]` is the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a`.
- `lmx` remains unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is `200009`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`. After all iterations of the loop, `lmn[200009]` is the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a`, `lmx` remains unchanged, and `i` is 200009.**
