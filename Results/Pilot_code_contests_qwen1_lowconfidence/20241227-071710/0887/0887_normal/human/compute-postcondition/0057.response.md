The code updates `rmn[i - 1]` to be equal to `rmn[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `rmn[i - 1]` corresponds to `rmn[0]`. Therefore, `rmn[0]` is updated to be equal to `rmn[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` with its element at index 0 now set to the element at index 1, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, if `rmn[200007] > rmn[200008]`, then `rmn` and `rmx` maintain this relationship. Otherwise, no changes are made to `rmn` and `rmx`, and `i` is 1.**
