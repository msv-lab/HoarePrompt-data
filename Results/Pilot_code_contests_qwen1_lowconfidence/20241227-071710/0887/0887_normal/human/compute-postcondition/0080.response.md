Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least one tuple. `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged. `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`. `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`. `i` is `3` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`. Regardless of the condition `lmn[i] < rmn[i]`, `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`.***
