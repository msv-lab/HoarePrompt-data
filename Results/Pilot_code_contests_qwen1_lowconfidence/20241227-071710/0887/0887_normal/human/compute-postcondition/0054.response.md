`rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, so the assignment `rmn[i - 1] = rmn[i]` modifies the tuple in `rmn`. Since `i` is 200008, `i - 1` is 200007. Therefore, the element at index 200007 in `rmn` is set to the element at index 200008 in `rmn`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn` with its element at index 200007 set to the element at index 200008, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200008**
