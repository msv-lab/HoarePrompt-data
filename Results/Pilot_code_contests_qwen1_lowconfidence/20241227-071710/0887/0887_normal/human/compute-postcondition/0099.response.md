The code `lmn[i] = lmn[i + 1]` updates the value of `lmn[i]` to be equal to `lmn[i + 1]`. Since `lmn[i-1]` was originally equal to `lmn[i]`, the new value of `lmn[i]` will also make `lmn[i-1]` equal to `lmn[i+1]`. However, since the original value of `lmn[i-1]` was already equal to `lmn[i]`, and `lmn[i]` is now updated to be equal to `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmn[i-1]` will now also be equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the updated conditions are:
- `lmn[i-1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.
- `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.

The Output State is: **`lmn[i-1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`**.
