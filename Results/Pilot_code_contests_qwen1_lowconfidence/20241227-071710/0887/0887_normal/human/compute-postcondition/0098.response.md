To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial State Information**:
   - The variable `i` is within the range \([0, 200008]\).
   - The condition `lmn[i] == lmn[i + 1]` is true.
   - If `lmn[i]` was originally less than `lmn[i + 1]`, then after the execution, `lmn[i]` equals `lmn[i + 1]`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the condition `lmn[i] == lmn[i + 1]` holds true.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` was previously within the range \([0, 200008]\), after incrementing, `i` will be in the range \([1, 200009]\).

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `lmn[i] == lmn[i + 1]` needs to be checked again for the next value of `i`.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `i + 1`.
- `lmn[i]` will now be compared with `lmn[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is within the range \([1, 200009]\), and `lmn[i-1]` equals `lmn[i]`. If `lmn[i-1]` was originally less than `lmn[i]`, then after the execution, `lmn[i-1]` equals `lmn[i]`. No change occurs in the else part since there is no else part provided.**
