Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`.
   - All other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`.
   - `i` is `2` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`.
   - `lmn[i]` remains equal to `rmn[i]` regardless of the condition `lmn[i] < rmn[i]`.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `200009` inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2`.

3. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `[0, 200009]`.
   - Since the loop is `for i in xrange(200010)`, the next value of `i` will be `3`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx[0]` remains the maximum value in `rmx`.
   - All other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) remain `rmx[0]`.
   - `lmn[i]` remains equal to `rmn[i]` regardless of the condition `lmn[i] < rmn[i]`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is `3` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`, and `lmn[i]` remains equal to `rmn[i]` regardless of the condition `lmn[i] < rmn[i]`.**
