Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `dat` is a map object containing exactly `2 * n` elements; `s` is a list where each sublist `s[0]` and `s[1]` contains exactly `n` elements. Each element in `s[x + y & 1]` is of the form `(-x + y, x + y)` where `x` is the value at key `i * 2` in `dat` and `y` is the value at key `i * 2 + 1` in `dat`, and `i` ranges from `0` to `n - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **Variables and their final states:**
  - `n`: Given as a positive integer.
  - `dat`: A map object with exactly `2 * n` elements.
  - `s`: A list with two sublists, both of which will contain `n` elements after the loop completes. The elements in these sublists are tuples of the form `(-x + y, x + y)` where `x` and `y` are elements from `dat`.

- **Loop Behavior:**
  - The loop runs `n` times.
  - For each iteration `i` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`), the loop extracts `x` and `y` from `dat` using the keys `i * 2` and `i * 2 + 1`, respectively.
  - It then appends a tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` to the sublist `s[x + y & 1]` (where `&` denotes the bitwise AND operation).

- **Final Values:**
  - After `n` iterations, each sublist `s[0]` and `s[1]` will have exactly `n` elements, each being a tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` where `x` and `y` are values from `dat`.

- **No Execution Case:**
  - If `n` is `0`, the loop does not execute, and `s` remains as `[[], []]`.

This ensures that the output state correctly captures the final values of all relevant variables after the loop has completed its execution.
