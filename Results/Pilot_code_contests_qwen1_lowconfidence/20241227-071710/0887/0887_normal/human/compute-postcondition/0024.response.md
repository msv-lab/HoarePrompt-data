Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is equal to \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\), `lmn[x]` is the maximum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that \(lmx[x] < y\), and `lmx[x]` is the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that \(lmn[x] > y\).**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: This list must contain at least one tuple initially. After the loop, its contents remain unchanged because the loop updates `lmn` and `lmx` based on the values in `a`, but it does not modify `a` itself.
- **`x`**: The value of `x` after processing each tuple in `a` is calculated as \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\). This transformation is applied to each `x` in the tuples within `a`.
- **`lmn[x]` and `lmx[x]`**: These lists store the maximum and minimum values of `y` for each corresponding `x` after processing all tuples in `a`. Specifically:
  - For each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, if `lmn[x] > y`, then `lmn[x]` is updated to `y`.
  - For each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, if `lmx[x] < y`, then `lmx[x]` is updated to `y`.

Thus, after the loop completes, `lmn[x]` and `lmx[x]` will hold the maximum and minimum values of `y` respectively, considering all tuples in `a` that map to the same `x` after the transformation.
