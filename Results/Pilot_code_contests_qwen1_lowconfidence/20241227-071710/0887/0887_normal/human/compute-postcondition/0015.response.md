Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `stdin`, an input data access object providing coordinate data for the tokens. The function reads the coordinates of `n` black tokens from `stdin`, processes these coordinates by categorizing them into two lists based on the parity of the sum of their coordinates, and then calls another function `func_1` on each list, summing the results and printing the total. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than \(10^5\), or if the coordinate values exceed \([-10^5, 10^5]\), the function will still read the data and proceed. However, it does not handle invalid inputs explicitly.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input data provided via `stdin` is valid and follows the constraints (`1 <= n <= 10^5` and `-10^5 <= x, y <= 10^5`). It does not check if these conditions are met.
- The function does not provide any error handling for invalid input data beyond the basic type and range checks inherent in the parsing logic.
- The function does not modify the `dat` map object after reading the data; it only uses the data for processing and passing to `func_1`.

**Final state of the program after the function concludes:**
- `n` remains unchanged and represents the number of black tokens.
- `dat` is a map object containing exactly `2 * n` elements, representing the coordinates of the black tokens.
- `s` is a list of two sublists, each containing exactly `n` elements. Each element in `s[x + y & 1]` is a tuple of the form `(-x + y, x + y)`, where `x` and `y` are the coordinates of a black token. The sublists are categorized based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates (`x + y`).
