Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates (x, y) of a black token's initial position. The coordinates are distinct and within the range [-100000, 100000]. The function processes these coordinates to determine the maximum and minimum y-values for each x-coordinate, stored in arrays `lmn` and `lmx` respectively. It then iterates through these arrays to adjust their values based on specific conditions, ensuring that `lmn` is non-decreasing and `lmx` is non-increasing. Finally, it calculates and returns `ans`, which is the sum of \((\text{lmx}[j] - \text{lmn}[j]) / 2\) for all valid indices \(j\) from 0 to 200007 where \(\text{lmn}[j] < \text{lmx}[j]\).**

**Edge Cases:**
1. If the input list `a` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` due to attempts to access indices out of bounds in the `lmn` and `lmx` arrays.
2. If all y-values in the list `a` are identical, the function will still execute as intended, resulting in `lmn` and `lmx` being adjusted appropriately, and `ans` being calculated based on the final values of `lmn` and `lmx`.

**Missing Functionality:**
1. The function does not handle cases where the input list `a` contains duplicate x-coordinates. While the code ensures distinct x-coordinates are processed, it does not explicitly handle duplicates, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such cases occur.
