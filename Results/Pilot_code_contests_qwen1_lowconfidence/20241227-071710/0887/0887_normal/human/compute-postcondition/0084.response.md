`lmx[i]` is assigned the value of `rmx[i]`. Given that `lmx[i]` was originally greater than `rmx[i]`, this assignment will change its value to `rmx[i]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, and all other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is within the range [0, 200009], and for every index `j` in the range [0, 200008], `lmn[j]` is equal to `rmn[j]`. Additionally, `lmx[i]` is now equal to `rmx[i]`.**
