The code `ans += (lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` to its current value. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans`, `lmx`, or `lmn`. Therefore, the only updated variable is `ans`, which now includes the addition of `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2`.

Given the initial state where `i` is 0, the output state will be:

Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans` is updated by adding (lmx[0] - lmn[0]) / 2 to its current value**
