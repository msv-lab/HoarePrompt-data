To ensure the for loop can execute according to the given conditions, we need to adjust the initial states of the variables involved. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `a` must contain at least one tuple. This means there should be at least one tuple in `a`.
   - `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`. This means `lmn` and `lmx` should have appropriate values derived from at least one tuple in `a`.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, and `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

2. **Final State After Loop Execution**:
   - After all iterations of the loop, `lmn[200009]` should be the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a`.
   - `lmx` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is 200009.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `200008` (since `i` is incremented at the start of each iteration).
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `i < 200009` must hold true until `i` reaches `200009`.

Given these points, we need to ensure the following initial states:
- There must be at least one tuple in `a`.
- `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized such that they can be updated during the loop.
- `i` should start at `0` to allow the loop to iterate correctly.

Therefore, the required initial state before the loop is:
State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0**
