Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0. If `lmx[i + 1]` is equal to `lmx[i]`, then the values of `lmx` and `rmx` remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur if the condition `lmx[i + 1] < lmx[i]` is false.***
