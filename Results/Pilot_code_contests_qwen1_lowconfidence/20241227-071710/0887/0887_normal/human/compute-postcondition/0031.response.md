According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `200008` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than `200008`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against the upper limit of `200008`.

Since the loop condition is `for i in xrange(200009)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < 200009`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `200008`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `200009`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `a` must contain at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` must be `200009`.

State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 200009**
