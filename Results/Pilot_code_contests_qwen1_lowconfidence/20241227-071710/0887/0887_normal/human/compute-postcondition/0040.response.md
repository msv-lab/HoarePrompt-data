The code `lmx[i + 1] = lmx[i]` updates the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to be the same as `lmx[i]`. Given the initial conditions, the current value of `lmx[i + 1]` is less than `lmx[i]`. After executing the line of code, `lmx[i + 1]` will be updated to be equal to `lmx[i]`, making `lmx[i + 1]` no longer less than `lmx[i]`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `lmx[i + 1]` is now equal to `lmx[i]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized with valid values based on the tuples in `a`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0, `lmx[i + 1]` is equal to `lmx[i]`**
