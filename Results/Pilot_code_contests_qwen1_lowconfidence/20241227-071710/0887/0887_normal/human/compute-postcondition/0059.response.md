Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1. `rmn` is adjusted such that for all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmn[i]` is the maximum of `rmn[i]` and `rmn[i + 1]`. If the condition `rmn[i - 1] > rmn[i]` holds for any `i` from 200008 to 1, then `rmn` maintains the relationship; otherwise, no changes are made to `rmn` and `rmx`, and `i` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Conditions:** The initial state specifies that `a` must contain at least one tuple, and `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged throughout the loop. `rmn` and `rmx` are shallow copies of `lmn` and `lmx`, respectively, and `i` starts at 200009.
- **Loop Behavior:** The loop runs in reverse from 200009 down to 1. During each iteration, if `rmn[i - 1]` is greater than `rmn[i]`, `rmn[i - 1]` is updated to `rmn[i]`. This ensures that `rmn[i - 1]` always holds the maximum value between `rmn[i - 1]` and `rmn[i]`.
- **Final Condition:** After the loop completes, `rmn` will have been adjusted so that for all `i` from 0 to 200008, `rmn[i]` is the maximum of `rmn[i]` and `rmn[i + 1]`. If no updates were made during the loop (i.e., `rmn[i - 1] <= rmn[i]` for all `i`), then `rmn` remains unchanged. In both cases, `i` will be set to 1 at the end of the loop.
