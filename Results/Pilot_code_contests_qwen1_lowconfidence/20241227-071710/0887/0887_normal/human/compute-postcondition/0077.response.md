Postcondition: ***`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is `2` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`, and `lmn[i]` remains equal to `rmn[i]` regardless of the condition `lmn[i] < rmn[i]`.***
