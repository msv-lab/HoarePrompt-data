`lmx[x]` is assigned the value of `y`. Given the precondition, the value of `x` is \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\), and the state of `y` remains undefined because no else part is provided in the conditional statement. The value of `a` remains unchanged since no tuples are modified or added to `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must contain at least two tuples, `x` is equal to \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\), `lmx[x]` is assigned `y`, and the state of `y` remains undefined.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least two tuples, `x` is equal to \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\), `lmx[x]` is assigned `y`, and the state of `y` remains undefined.**
