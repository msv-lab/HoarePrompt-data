Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`.
   - All other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`.
   - `i` is `1` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`.
   - `lmn[i]` is now equal to `rmn[i]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in xrange(200010):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - The loop will increment `i` by `1` at each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `[0, 200009]`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `2`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1`, the new value of `i` is `2`.
   - The conditions for `i` being within the range `[0, 200009]` are still satisfied because `2` is within this range.
   - The values of `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
   - `rmn` remains a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx[0]` is still the maximum value in `rmx`.
   - All other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) remain `rmx[0]`.
   - `lmn[i]` is now equal to `rmn[i]`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is `2` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`, and `lmn[i]` is now equal to `rmn[i]`.**
