The code `lmn[i] = rmn[i]` assigns the value of `rmn[i]` to `lmn[i]`. Given that `lmn[i]` remains equal to `rmn[i]` regardless of the condition `lmn[i] < rmn[i]`, this assignment does not change the equality of `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`. 

- `lmn` and `rmn` remain as shallow copies of each other.
- All other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are still `rmx[0]`.
- `i` is still `3`.
- `lmn[i]` is still equal to `rmn[i]`.

Therefore, the only change is in the value of `lmn[i]` which is now explicitly set to the value of `rmn[i]`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`, all other elements in `rmx` (from `1` to `200008`) are also `rmx[0]`, `i` is `3` and must be within the range `[0, 200009]`, and `lmn[i]` is equal to `rmn[i]`.**
