The code snippet assigns `lmx[:]` (a shallow copy of the list `lmx`) to `rmx`. This does not change the values of the elements in `lmx` or `rmn`, but it updates `rmx` to be a shallow copy of `lmx`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is equal to \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\), `lmn[x]` is the maximum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that `lmn[x] < y`, `lmx[x]` is the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that `lmn[x] > y`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, and `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

Output State: **`a` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is equal to \((x - 1) / 2 + 100005\), `lmn[x]` is the maximum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that `lmn[x] < y`, `lmx[x]` is the minimum value of `y` among all tuples in `a` such that `lmn[x] > y`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**
