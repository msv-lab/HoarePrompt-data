The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`. `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates (x, y) of a black token's initial position. The coordinates are distinct and within the range [-100000, 100000].

The function calculates and returns `ans`, which is the sum of \((\text{lmx}[j] - \text{lmn}[j]) / 2\) for all \(j\) from 0 to 200007 where \(\text{lmn}[j] < \text{lmx}[j]\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of tuples `a` and return the sum of \((\text{lmx}[j] - \text{lmn}[j]) / 2\) for all valid indices \(j\) from 0 to 200007 where \(\text{lmn}[j] < \text{lmx}[j]\).
