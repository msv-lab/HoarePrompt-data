The code `lmx[i] = lmx[i + 1]` assigns the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to `lmx[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is updated to 4, this means:

- `lmx[4]` will be assigned the value of `lmx[5]`.

Since the other variables (`lmn`, `ans`) and the comparison condition remain unchanged, the only change is in the value of `lmx[4]`.

Output State: **`i` is 4; `lmx[4]` is equal to `lmx[5]`; `lmn` is unchanged; `ans` is unchanged**
