Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `a` contains at least one tuple.
- `lmn` and `lmx` remain unchanged.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx[0]` is the maximum value in `rmx`.
- All other elements in `rmx` (from 1 to 200008) are also `rmx[0]`.
- `i` is 200010.
- `ans` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 200008`. The loop will run as long as `i < 200009`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Initially, `i` is set to 200010. This means that `i` is greater than the upper limit of the loop (200008).

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `i` is initially 200010, it does not satisfy the condition `i < 200009`. Therefore, the loop will not execute.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be set to a value within the range `[0, 200008]`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` should be adjusted to a value within the range `[0, 200008]` so that the loop condition `i < 200009` is satisfied.
- All other states (`a`, `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`, and `ans`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` must be within the range [0, 200008]**
