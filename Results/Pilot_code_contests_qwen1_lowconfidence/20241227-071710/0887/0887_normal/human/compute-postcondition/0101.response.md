Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `lmn[i-1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`
   - `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in xrange(200009):
   ```

3. **Current Iteration**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Increment of `i`**: In a `for i in range(n)` loop, `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration. Therefore, if the loop was just completed, the value of `i` was the same as the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `200008` (inclusive), if the loop just finished, the current `i` value is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
   - The conditions given are based on `lmn[i-1]`, `lmn[i]`, and `lmn[i+1]`. For the next iteration, these conditions will refer to `lmn[i]`, `lmn[i+1]`, and `lmn[i+2]`.

6. **New Conditions**:
   - `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]` (from the previous condition `lmn[i-1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`)
   - `lmn[i + 1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 2]` (new condition derived from the previous one)

7. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The conditions for the next iteration are that `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]` and `lmn[i + 1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmn[i + 1]` is equal to `lmn[i + 2]`**
