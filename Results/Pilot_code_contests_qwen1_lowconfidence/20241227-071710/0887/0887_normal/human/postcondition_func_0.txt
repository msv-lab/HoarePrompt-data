The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates (x, y) of a black token's initial position. The coordinates are distinct and within the range [-100000, 100000]. The function processes these coordinates to determine the maximum and minimum y-values for each x-coordinate, stored in arrays `lmn` and `lmx` respectively. It then iterates through these arrays to adjust their values based on specific conditions, ensuring that `lmn` is non-decreasing and `lmx` is non-increasing. Finally, it calculates and returns `ans`, which is the sum of \((\text{lmx}[j] - \text{lmn}[j]) / 2\) for all valid indices \(j\) from 0 to 200007 where \(\text{lmn}[j] < \text{lmx}[j]\).
