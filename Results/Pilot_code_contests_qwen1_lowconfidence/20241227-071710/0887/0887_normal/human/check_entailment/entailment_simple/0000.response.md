Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads the number of black tokens (`n`) and their initial positions from the standard input.
   - It then processes the coordinates and categorizes them into two lists based on the parity of the sum of their coordinates (`x + y`).

2. **Coordinate Transformation**:
   - The transformed coordinates `(-x + y, x + y)` are used to determine the optimal placement for the white token. This transformation helps in simplifying the problem by mapping the coordinates to a more manageable range.

3. **Dynamic Programming and Array Operations**:
   - The functions `func_1()` perform dynamic programming-like operations to find the minimum and maximum y-coordinates for each transformed coordinate.
   - These operations ensure that the white token cannot end up in a position where a black token is present after any sequence of moves.

4. **Calculation of Valid Positions**:
   - Finally, the program calculates the number of valid starting positions for the white token by summing up the differences between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates divided by 2.

The program correctly handles the problem constraints and ensures that the calculations are performed as per the problem description. It processes the input coordinates, transforms them, and computes the number of valid starting positions for the white token using the specified algorithm.

Since the program follows the steps described in the problem statement accurately, it is correct.
