You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Consider the following game for two players. There is one white token and some number of black tokens. Each token is placed on a plane in a point with integer coordinates x and y.

The players take turn making moves, white starts. On each turn, a player moves all tokens of their color by 1 to up, down, left or right. Black player can choose directions for each token independently.

After a turn of the white player the white token can not be in a point where a black token is located. There are no other constraints on locations of the tokens: positions of black tokens can coincide, after a turn of the black player and initially the white token can be in the same point with some black point. If at some moment the white player can't make a move, he loses. If the white player makes 10100500 moves, he wins.

You are to solve the following problem. You are given initial positions of all black tokens. It is guaranteed that initially all these positions are distinct. In how many places can the white token be located initially so that if both players play optimally, the black player wins?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of black points.

The (i + 1)-th line contains two integers xi, yi ( - 105 ≤ xi, yi, ≤ 105) — the coordinates of the point where the i-th black token is initially located.

It is guaranteed that initial positions of black tokens are distinct.

Output

Print the number of points where the white token can be located initially, such that if both players play optimally, the black player wins.

In the third example the white tokens should be located in the inner square 2 × 2, to make the black player win. <image>

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
