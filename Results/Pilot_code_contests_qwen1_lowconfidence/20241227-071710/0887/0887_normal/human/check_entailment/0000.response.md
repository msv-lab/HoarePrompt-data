Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program seems to focus on a different problem, possibly related to finding the number of points where the white token can be located such that the black player wins, but the implementation details do not align with the problem's requirements.

To illustrate, let's consider the problem statement again:

- We need to count the number of initial positions for the white token such that if both players play optimally, the black player wins.
- The key point is that after each move of the white player, the white token cannot be in a position occupied by any black token.

However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be implementing a different algorithm that calculates something about the positions of points but does not directly address the game's rules or the objective of the problem.

For instance, `func_1` and `func_2` involve complex operations on arrays and do not clearly reflect the game's constraints and the requirement to count valid initial positions for the white token.

Given that the program does not correctly handle the problem's constraints and logic, it fails to meet the requirements, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
