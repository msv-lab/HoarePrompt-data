Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the initial positions of black tokens are symmetrically placed around the origin. Specifically, if there are black tokens at positions \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\), the code fails to correctly account for the fact that the white token cannot be in a position where a black token is located after a move. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
-1 0
1 0
0 -1
```

According to the problem description, if the black tokens are placed at \((-1, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((0, -1)\), the white token cannot be at \((0, 0)\) initially because after the black player's move, one of the black tokens could move to \((0, 0)\), making it impossible for the white player to move.

However, the current implementation of the code does not handle this case properly. The code only ensures that the white token does not end up on the same x or y coordinate as a black token after the move, but it does not account for the symmetry and the possibility of the white token being in a position where a black token can move to after the black player's turn.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
