You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Consider the following game for two players. There is one white token and some number of black tokens. Each token is placed on a plane in a point with integer coordinates x and y.

The players take turn making moves, white starts. On each turn, a player moves all tokens of their color by 1 to up, down, left or right. Black player can choose directions for each token independently.

After a turn of the white player the white token can not be in a point where a black token is located. There are no other constraints on locations of the tokens: positions of black tokens can coincide, after a turn of the black player and initially the white token can be in the same point with some black point. If at some moment the white player can't make a move, he loses. If the white player makes 10100500 moves, he wins.

You are to solve the following problem. You are given initial positions of all black tokens. It is guaranteed that initially all these positions are distinct. In how many places can the white token be located initially so that if both players play optimally, the black player wins?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of black points.

The (i + 1)-th line contains two integers xi, yi ( - 105 ≤ xi, yi, ≤ 105) — the coordinates of the point where the i-th black token is initially located.

It is guaranteed that initial positions of black tokens are distinct.

Output

Print the number of points where the white token can be located initially, such that if both players play optimally, the black player wins.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the movement constraints and the optimal strategy for the black player.

### Analysis:

1. **Movement Constraints**: The problem states that the white token cannot be in the same position as any black token after a move by the white player. The program does not enforce this constraint in its logic.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The black player can choose directions for each token independently. The program's logic does not fully consider the strategic placement of black tokens to ensure the white player cannot move.

3. **Coordinate Transformation**: The transformation `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005` used in the program seems arbitrary and does not align with the problem's requirement of distinct initial positions and movement constraints.

### Example Case:

Consider the following input:
```
4
-2 0
-1 1
0 -2
1 -1
```

- The initial positions of black tokens are:
  - (-2, 0)
  - (-1, 1)
  - (0, -2)
  - (1, -1)

- According to the problem, the black player should be able to place the white token in such a way that it is forced into a losing position after 10100500 moves.

- However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate the number of valid initial positions for the white token.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of valid initial positions for the white token such that the black player wins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `stdin`, an input data access object providing coordinate data for the tokens. The function reads the coordinates of `n` black tokens from `stdin`, processes these coordinates by categorizing them into two lists based on the parity of the sum of their coordinates, and then calls another function `func_1` on each list, summing the results and printing the total. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than \(10^5\), or if the coordinate values exceed \([-10^5, 10^5]\), the function will still read the data and proceed. However, it does not handle invalid inputs explicitly.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
