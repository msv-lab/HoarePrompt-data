Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and logic described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the movement constraints and the optimal strategy for the black player.

### Analysis:

1. **Movement Constraints**: The problem states that the white token cannot be in the same position as any black token after a move by the white player. The program does not enforce this constraint in its logic.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The black player can choose directions for each token independently. The program's logic does not fully consider the strategic placement of black tokens to ensure the white player cannot move.

3. **Coordinate Transformation**: The transformation `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005` used in the program seems arbitrary and does not align with the problem's requirement of distinct initial positions and movement constraints.

### Example Case:

Consider the following input:
```
4
-2 0
-1 1
0 -2
1 -1
```

- The initial positions of black tokens are:
  - (-2, 0)
  - (-1, 1)
  - (0, -2)
  - (1, -1)

- According to the problem, the black player should be able to place the white token in such a way that it is forced into a losing position after 10100500 moves.

- However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate the number of valid initial positions for the white token.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of valid initial positions for the white token such that the black player wins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
