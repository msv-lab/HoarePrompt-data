Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of initial positions for the white token such that the black player wins. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not properly account for the constraints of the game, particularly regarding the movements and the positions of the tokens.

- **Function `func_1`:** This function processes the coordinates of the black tokens and calculates the sum of possible valid positions for the white token. However, the logic in this function does not fully capture the game rules. For instance, it calculates the maximum and minimum y-values for each x-coordinate but does not ensure that the white token cannot end up in a position occupied by a black token after the white player's move.

- **Function `func_2`:** This function reads the input and calls `func_1` twice, once for each list of coordinates categorized based on the parity of the sum of their coordinates. While this part of the code seems to follow the structure of processing the input correctly, the underlying logic in `func_1` is flawed, leading to an incorrect final result.

To properly solve this problem, the code needs to:
1. Determine the valid regions on the grid where the white token can start such that no matter how the black tokens move, the white token will eventually be blocked.
2. Ensure that the logic correctly accounts for the fact that the white token cannot occupy the same position as a black token after the white player's move.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
