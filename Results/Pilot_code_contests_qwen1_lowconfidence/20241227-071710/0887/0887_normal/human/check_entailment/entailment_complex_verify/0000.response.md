Final: **False**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be accurate. Let's break down the reasons:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function processes a list of tuples representing the coordinates of black tokens.
   - It calculates arrays `lmn` and `lmx` to store the minimum and maximum y-values for each x-coordinate, respectively.
   - These calculations do not directly reflect the game's constraints, particularly the requirement that the white token cannot occupy the same position as any black token after each move.
   - The final result `ans` is calculated as the sum of \((\text{lmx}[j] - \text{lmn}[j]) / 2\) for all valid indices where \(\text{lmn}[j] < \text{lmx}[j]\). This does not align with counting valid initial positions for the white token such that the black player wins.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function categorizes the black tokens based on the parity of the sum of their coordinates and passes these categories to `func_1`.
   - While it processes the input data correctly, the way `func_1` processes this data and computes the result does not match the problem's requirements.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The core logic in `func_1` does not account for the game's rules, specifically the constraint that the white token cannot be in the same position as any black token after each move.
   - The approach taken in the code focuses on a different mathematical computation rather than solving the game's constraints.

Given these observations, the annotated version confirms that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is accurate.
