Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_2` reads the input and passes it to `func_1`, but the processing done in `func_1` does not accurately reflect the game rules.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling of Coordinates**: The function `func_1` processes the coordinates to find the maximum and minimum y-values for each x-coordinate. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the movement constraints of the game. The game requires that the white token cannot land on the same x-coordinate as any black token after each move, and the current implementation does not account for this constraint.

2. **Summation Logic**: The summation logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the number of valid starting positions for the white token. The formula \((\text{lmx}[j] - \text{lmn}[j]) / 2\) is used to count the number of valid y-coordinates for each x-coordinate, but this does not take into account the movement constraints of the game.

3. **Incorrect Parity Handling**: The function `func_2` categorizes the black tokens based on the parity of the sum of their coordinates (`x + y`). This categorization is not relevant to the problem description, as the problem does not specify any restriction based on the sum of coordinates being even or odd.

### Example where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
4
-2 -1
0 1
0 -3
2 -1
```

- According to the problem description, the black tokens are placed at \((-2, -1)\), \((0, 1)\), \((0, -3)\), and \((2, -1)\).
- The white token needs to avoid landing on the same x-coordinate as any black token after each move.
- The correct solution would consider the positions and movements, but the current implementation fails to do so.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described, hence the correctness is **False**.
