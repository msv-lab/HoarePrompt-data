`n` is an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `stdin` is an object providing input data access. For each black token, `dat` contains pairs of integers `(x, y)` representing the x and y coordinates of the token's initial position, with the constraint that `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `-10^5 <= x, y <= 10^5`. The initial positions of black tokens are distinct.
