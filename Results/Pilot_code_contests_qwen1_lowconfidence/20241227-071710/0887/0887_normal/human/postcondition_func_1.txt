The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of black tokens, and `stdin`, an input data access object providing coordinate data for the tokens. The function reads the coordinates of `n` black tokens from `stdin`, processes these coordinates by categorizing them into two lists based on the parity of the sum of their coordinates, and then calls another function `func_1` on each list, summing the results and printing the total. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than \(10^5\), or if the coordinate values exceed \([-10^5, 10^5]\), the function will still read the data and proceed. However, it does not handle invalid inputs explicitly.
