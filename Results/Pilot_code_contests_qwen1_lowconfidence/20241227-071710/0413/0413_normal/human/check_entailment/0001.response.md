Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers given in different bases. The program reads the number of digits and the base for each number, converts them to base 10, and then compares the two numbers. The logic handles the conversion and comparison as described in the problem statement. Since the program works correctly for all the given examples and no edge cases were found where the program fails, the program is correct.
