Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input to extract the necessary parameters (number of digits `n` and `m`, and the bases `bx` and `by`). It uses the `raw_input()` function to read the input and splits it into the required values.

2. **Base Conversion**: The program correctly converts the numbers from their respective bases (`bx` and `by`) to integers. It iterates through the digits of each number in reverse order and calculates the decimal value by multiplying each digit by the corresponding power of the base and summing these products.

3. **Comparison**: The program compares the converted integers `x` and `y`. Based on the comparison, it sets the variable `ans` to one of the characters `'='`, `'<'`, or `'>'`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the result based on the comparison.

Given the constraints and assumptions (valid input, no error handling for invalid inputs), the program accurately performs the tasks outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
