You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base bx and a number Y represented in base by. Compare those two numbers.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and bx (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the bx-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (0 ≤ xi < bx) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and by (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), where m is the number of digits in the by-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y1, y2, ..., ym (0 ≤ yi < by) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.

Output

Output a single character (quotes for clarity): 

  * '<' if X < Y
  * '>' if X > Y
  * '=' if X = Y

Examples

Input

Note

In the first sample, X = 1011112 = 4710 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 1023 = 215 and Y = 245 = 1123, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, <image> and Y = 48031509. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and bx is much larger than by, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = raw_input().split(' ')
    n = int(s[0])
    bx = int(s[1])
    x = 0
    xs = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        a = int(xs[n - 1 - i])
        x = x + bx ** i * a
    s = raw_input().split(' ')
    m = int(s[0])
    by = int(s[1])
    y = 0
    ys = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        a = int(ys[m - 1 - i])
        y = y + by ** i * a
    if x == y:
        ans = '='
    elif x > y:
        ans = '>'
    else:
        ans = '<'
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the bases \( bx \) and \( by \) are equal. In the problem description, it is specified that \( bx \neq by \), but the program does not check this condition before proceeding with the conversion and comparison of the numbers. 

For example, consider the following input where \( bx = by \):

Input:
```
3 2
1 1 1
3 2
1 1 1
```

The program will not check if the bases are equal and will proceed to convert and compare the numbers, which could lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not cover the edge case where \( bx = by \).

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two bases and their respective digit representations from the user input, converts them into integers, and compares these integers. The function then outputs one of three characters: '=', '<', or '>', depending on whether the first integer is equal to, less than, or greater than the second integer. The function ensures that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range [1, 10], `bx` and `by` are integers within the range [2, 40], and `bx` is not equal to `by`. If any of these conditions are violated, the function does not provide an explicit error message but rather focuses on the comparison and output based on valid inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
