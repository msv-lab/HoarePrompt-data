Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the base `bx` or `by` is 2 and the corresponding number has leading zeros. Specifically, the code assumes that the digits are given in the standard decimal system, but it does not account for leading zeros that might occur when converting from a higher base to a lower base.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 2
0 1 0
2 10
1 2
```

The number `X` in base 2 is `010`, which is `2` in decimal. The number `Y` in base 10 is `1`, which is `1` in decimal. According to the problem description, the output should be `<` because `X < Y`.

However, the current implementation of the code will not handle this case correctly. It will convert `010` (base 2) to `2` in decimal, and `1` (base 10) to `1` in decimal, and output `=` instead of `<`.

To fix this, the code needs to properly handle leading zeros and ensure that the conversion from base `bx` and `by` to decimal is done correctly, especially when dealing with bases like 2 where leading zeros can occur.
