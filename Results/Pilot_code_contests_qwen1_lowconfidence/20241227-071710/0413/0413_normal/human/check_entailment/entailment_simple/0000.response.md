Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input as specified in the problem description. It first reads the number of digits and the base for the first number (X), followed by the digits of X. Then, it reads the number of digits and the base for the second number (Y), followed by the digits of Y.
   
2. **Conversion to Decimal**:
   - The program correctly converts the base-bx representation of X into its decimal form. This is done using a for loop that iterates over the digits of X in reverse order, multiplying each digit by the appropriate power of bx.
   - Similarly, it converts the base-by representation of Y into its decimal form using another for loop that does the same for the digits of Y in reverse order.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After converting both numbers to their decimal forms, the program compares them. Depending on whether X is less than, greater than, or equal to Y, it assigns the appropriate character ('<', '>', '=') to the variable `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the result stored in `ans`, which matches the output format specified in the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description for every potential valid input case. Therefore, the program is correct.
