To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and analyze the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer value of `s[0]` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10)
- `m` is `n` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10)
- `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]` (2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by)
- `by` is an integer (2 ≤ by ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by)
- `xi` and `yi` are integers (0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by for all i)
- `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `x` is the integer value represented by the string `xs` in base `bx`
- `y` is updated to `y + by`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `m - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means it starts at `m - 1` and decrements down to `-1`.
- Since the loop is iterating in reverse, it will start with `m - 1` and continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is currently at `-1` (the last value before decrementing further would be `0`).

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than `-1`.
- Therefore, `i` should be `0` at the start of the next iteration.

### Updated States:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `m` remains unchanged since it is defined as `n` and does not change within the loop.

### New State:
- `n` is still the integer value of `s[0]` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10).
- `m` is still `n` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10).
- `bx` is still the integer value of `s[1]` (2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by).
- `by` is still an integer (2 ≤ by ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by).
- `xi` and `yi` are still integers (0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by for all i).
- `s` is still a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `x` is still the integer value represented by the string `xs` in base `bx`.
- `y` is still updated to `y + by`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer value of `s[0]` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `m` is `n` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10), `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]` (2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by), `by` is an integer (2 ≤ by ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by), `xi` and `yi` are integers (0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by for all i), `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `x` is the integer value represented by the string `xs` in base `bx`, `y` is updated to `y + by, `i` is 0**
