The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The constraints provided are for variables within the function's scope, but since the function signature does not list any parameters, we focus on the described behavior.

The function checks the conditions for `n`, `m`, `bx`, `by`, `xi`, and `yi` as specified. However, since these are not passed as parameters, they must be defined within the function itself.

Based on the given output cases, the function will return different values depending on the conditions met.

Functionality: **The function returns an error message if `n` or `m` is not between 1 and 10, or if `bx` or `by` is not between 2 and 40 and `bx` is not equal to `by`. Otherwise, it returns a classification based on the values of `xi` and `yi` where "minor" is returned if `xi` and `yi` are both zero, and "adult" otherwise.**
