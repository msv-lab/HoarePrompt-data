Output State: **`n` is an integer value of `s[0]` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `m` is `n` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10), `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]` (2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by), `by` is an integer (2 ≤ by ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by), `xi` and `yi` are integers (0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by for all i), `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `x` is the integer value represented by the string `xs` in base `bx`, `y` is updated to `y + by`, `i` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `ys[m - 1 - i]`**
