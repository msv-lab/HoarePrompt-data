The code `s = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and assigns this list to the variable `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `bx`, `by`, `xi`, and `yi` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the only variable that changes its state is `s`, which now holds a list of strings obtained from the input. The initial conditions for `n`, `m`, `bx`, `by`, `xi`, and `yi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10, `bx` and `by` are integers such that 2 ≤ bx, by ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by, `xi` and `yi` are integers such that 0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by for all i, `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
