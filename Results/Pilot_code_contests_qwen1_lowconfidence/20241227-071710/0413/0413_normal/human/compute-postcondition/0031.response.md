The variable `ans` is assigned the value `'='`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value of `s[0]` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10); `m` is `n` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10); `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]` (2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by); `by` is an integer (2 ≤ by ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by); `xi` and `yi` are integers (0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by for all i); `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `x` is the integer value represented by the string `xs` in base `bx`; `y` is the integer value represented by the list `ys` in base `bx`; `ans` is '='.**
