In the given code snippet, `y` is updated by adding `by` raised to the power of `i` multiplied by `a`. The values of `i`, `by`, and `a` are known from the initial state.

- `i` is `m - 2`, so `i` is an integer between 0 and `m - 2`.
- `by` is an integer between 2 and 40, excluding the value of `bx`.
- `a` is the integer value of `ys[1]`.

The equation `y = y + by ** i * a` updates the value of `y`. Since the exact values of `i`, `by`, and `a` are not specified, we express the updated value of `y` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value of `s[0]` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `m` is `n` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10), `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]` (2 ≤ bx ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by), `by` is an integer (2 ≤ by ≤ 40 and bx ≠ by), `xi` and `yi` are integers (0 ≤ xi < bx and 0 ≤ yi < by for all i), `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `x` is the integer value represented by the string `xs` in base `bx`, `y` is updated to `y + by ** i * a`, `ys` is the list obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is the integer value of `ys[1]`, `i` is `m - 2` (0 ≤ i < m)**
