The code `ys = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as separators, and assigns this list to the variable `ys`. However, none of the initial values of the variables `n`, `m`, `bx`, `by`, `xi`, `yi`, `s`, and `x` are directly affected by this operation. The only change is the introduction of the new list `ys`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer value of `s[0]`, \(1 \leq n \leq 10\); `m` is `n`, a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10\); `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]`, \(2 \leq bx \leq 40\) and `bx` ≠ `by`; `by` is an integer such that \(2 \leq by \leq 40\) and `bx` ≠ `by`; `xi` and `yi` are integers such that \(0 \leq xi < bx\) and \(0 \leq yi < by\) for all `i`; `s` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `x` is the integer value represented by the string `xs` in base `bx`; `y` is `0`; `ys` is the list obtained from the input split by spaces.**
