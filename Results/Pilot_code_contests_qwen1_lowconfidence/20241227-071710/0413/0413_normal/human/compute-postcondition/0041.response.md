Functionality: **The function reads two bases and their respective digit representations from the user input, converts them into integers, and compares these integers. The function then outputs one of three characters: '=', '<', or '>', depending on whether the first integer is equal to, less than, or greater than the second integer. The function ensures that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range [1, 10], `bx` and `by` are integers within the range [2, 40], and `bx` is not equal to `by`. If any of these conditions are violated, the function does not provide an explicit error message but rather focuses on the comparison and output based on valid inputs.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input values do not conform to the specified constraints (e.g., `n` or `m` outside [1, 10], `bx` or `by` outside [2, 40], or `bx` equals `by`), the function will still proceed with the comparison using the provided valid inputs, but the input validation is implicit through the subsequent steps.**

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit error handling for invalid inputs in terms of raising exceptions or returning an error message. The function assumes that the inputs are valid within the specified constraints and focuses solely on the comparison and output.
