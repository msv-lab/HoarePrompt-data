The code `xs = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and assigns this list to `xs`. The values of `n`, `m`, `bx`, `by`, `xi`, `yi`, and `x` are not directly affected by this operation, but the value of `xs` is created.

Since the initial state provides specific ranges for `n`, `m`, `bx`, `by`, `xi`, and `yi`, and these values are not modified by the given code, they remain within their respective ranges.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `s[0]`, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10; `bx` is the integer value of `s[1]`, 2 ≤ `bx` ≤ 40 and `bx` ≠ `by`; `by` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `by` ≤ 40 and `bx` ≠ `by`; `xi` and `yi` are integers such that 0 ≤ `xi` < `bx` and 0 ≤ `yi` < `by` for all i; `s` is now a list of strings obtained from the input; `x` is 0; `xs` is the list of strings from the input split by spaces.**
