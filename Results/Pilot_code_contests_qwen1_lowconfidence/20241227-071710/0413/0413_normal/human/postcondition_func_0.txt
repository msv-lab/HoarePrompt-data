The function reads two bases and their respective digit representations from the user input, converts them into integers, and compares these integers. The function then outputs one of three characters: '=', '<', or '>', depending on whether the first integer is equal to, less than, or greater than the second integer. The function ensures that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range [1, 10], `bx` and `by` are integers within the range [2, 40], and `bx` is not equal to `by`. If any of these conditions are violated, the function does not provide an explicit error message but rather focuses on the comparison and output based on valid inputs.
