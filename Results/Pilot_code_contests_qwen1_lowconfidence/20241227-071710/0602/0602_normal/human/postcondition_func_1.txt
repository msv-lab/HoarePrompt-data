The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `graph`. It reads these parameters from the input, constructs a graph represented as a list of lists, and then calls another function `func_1` with this graph. If the result of `func_1` contains `-1`, it prints "No" and returns immediately. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the indices of the nodes in the graph as determined by `func_1`, excluding `-1`. The function does not return any value itself.
