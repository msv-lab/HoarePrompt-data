The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `graph`. `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, respectively. The parameter `graph` is a list of lists where `graph[i]` contains integers representing the indices of rooms directly connected to Room i+1 via a passage, and all values in `graph` are valid according to the constraints provided. Since the output of the function is `None`, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to process the given parameters without returning any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `graph`, and processes them without returning any value.**
