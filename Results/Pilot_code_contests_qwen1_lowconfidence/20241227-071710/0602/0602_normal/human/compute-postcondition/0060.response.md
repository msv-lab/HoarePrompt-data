The code assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. Based on the initial state, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed. Also, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, and `w` is a node such that `depth[w]` is not equal to -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is equal to -1.

After executing the line `post[v] = w`, the value of `post[v]` is set to `w`, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the updated information includes the assignment of `w` to `post[v]`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed; `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`; `w` is a node such that `depth[w]` is not equal to -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is equal to -1; `post[v]` is `w`.**
