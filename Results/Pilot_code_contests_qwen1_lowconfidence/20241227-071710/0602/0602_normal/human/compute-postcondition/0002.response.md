The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the new variable `at_start`.

Output State: **args is a variable-length argument list containing the values to be printed, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` which is either ' ' or the original value of 'sep' if present, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` which is either `sys.stdout` or the original value of 'file' if present, `at_start` is `True`.**
