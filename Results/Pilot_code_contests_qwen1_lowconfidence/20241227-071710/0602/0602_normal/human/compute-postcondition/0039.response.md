The code snippet `q.append(w)` appends the value of `w` to the list `q`. This operation does not affect the values of `graph[v]`, `v`, `depth[v]`, `post[v]`, `used[w]`, or any other variables except for `q`.

- `graph[v]` remains unchanged.
- `v` remains unchanged.
- `depth[v]` remains unchanged.
- `post[v]` remains unchanged.
- `used[w]` remains unchanged.
- `q` is appended with `w`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and either its depth is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w` if `not used[w]` is true, otherwise the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged, `used[w]` is `True`, and `q` now includes the value of `w`.
