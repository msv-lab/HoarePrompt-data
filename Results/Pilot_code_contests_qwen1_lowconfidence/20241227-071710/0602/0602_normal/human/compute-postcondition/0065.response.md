Postcondition: **`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed and now includes `w`, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed. If `depth[w]` is not equal to -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is equal to -1, then `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`; `used[w]` is `True`.**
