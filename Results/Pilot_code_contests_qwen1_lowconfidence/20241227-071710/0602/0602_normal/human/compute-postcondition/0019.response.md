Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys.
- `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' '.
- `file` is `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `True`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for x in args:
    if not at_start:
        file.write(sep)
    file.write(str(x))
    at_start = False
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `at_start` is initially `True`. This means that the first call to `file.write(str(x))` will write directly to the file without any separator.

2. **First Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration (`x` is the first element of `args`), `at_start` is set to `False`. The output state after the first iteration is:
     - `args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list.
     - `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys.
     - `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' '.
     - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
     - `at_start` is `False`.
     - `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `str(x)`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each subsequent iteration, `at_start` remains `False`. Therefore, `sep` will be written before each element except the first one.
   - The output state after the second iteration (`x` is the second element of `args`) is:
     - `args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list.
     - `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys.
     - `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' '.
     - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
     - `at_start` is `False`.
     - `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `str(first_element) + sep + str(second_element)`.

4. **General Case**:
   - After `n` iterations, where `n` is the length of `args`, `at_start` remains `False` throughout.
   - `sys.stdout` will contain the concatenated string formed by writing each element of `args` separated by `sep`.

5. **Final State**:
   - If the loop executes for all elements in `args`, the final state will be:
     - `args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list.
     - `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys.
     - `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' '.
     - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
     - `at_start` is `False`.
     - `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `str(args[0]) + sep + str(args[1]) + ... + str(args[-1])`.

### Conclusion:
The loop ensures that all elements in `args` are written to `sys.stdout` with `sep` separating each element, except the first one. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `args` is empty), the values of the variables remain as they were initially.

### Output State:
Output State: **`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `sys.stdout` now contains the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.**
