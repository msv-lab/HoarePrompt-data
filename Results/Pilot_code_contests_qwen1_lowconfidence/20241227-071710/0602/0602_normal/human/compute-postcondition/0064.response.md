The code snippet appends `w` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, the following impacts occur:

- `q` was initially containing at least one element that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed.
- `q.append(w)` adds `w` to the list `q`.

The states of other variables (`graph[v]`, `v`, `depth[w]`, `depth[v]`, `post[v]`, and `used[w]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed and now includes `w` (the element `w` has been appended), and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed; if `depth[w]` is not equal to -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is equal to -1, then `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`; `used[w]` is `True`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed and now includes `w`, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed; if `depth[w]` is not equal to -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is equal to -1, then `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`; `used[w]` is `True`.**
