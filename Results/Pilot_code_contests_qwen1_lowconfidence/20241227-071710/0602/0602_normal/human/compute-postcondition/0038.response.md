`used[w]` is assigned the value `True`. This changes the value of `used[w]` from whatever it was previously to `True`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and either its depth is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w` if `not used[w]` is true, otherwise the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged, `used[w]` is `True`.**
