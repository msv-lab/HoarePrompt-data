The code `used[w] = True` updates the value of `used[w]` to `True`. It does not affect the values of `graph[v]`, `v`, `q`, `depth`, or `post`. The precondition that `depth[w]` is not -1 and (`depth[w]` < `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` == -1) leading to the update of `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` being `w` remains unchanged unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

Output State: **`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed, `used[w]` is `True`, and the update of `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` being `w` is preserved if applicable.**
