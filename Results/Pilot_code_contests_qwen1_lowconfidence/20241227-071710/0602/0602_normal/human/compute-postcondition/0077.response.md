The code `used[w] = True` sets the value of `used[w]` to `True`. No other variables are affected, so the states of `graph[v_new]`, `v`, `q`, `depth[w]`, `depth[v_new]`, and `post[v_new]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` has not been fully processed; `used[w]` is True.**
