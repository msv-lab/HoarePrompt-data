`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout` according to the initial state. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `x`, so `str(x)` will be written to `sys.stdout`. The `sep` and `at_start` variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `str(x)` written to it.**
