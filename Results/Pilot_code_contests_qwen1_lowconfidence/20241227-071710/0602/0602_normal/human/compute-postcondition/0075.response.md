The code `post[v] = w` assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. Based on the initial state, the value of `post[v_new]` remains unchanged, `graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, and `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`.

Output State: **`graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed, the element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` has not been fully processed, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v]` is `w`.**
