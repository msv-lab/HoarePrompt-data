The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to `sys.stdout`. Since `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', and `file` is `sys.stdout`, writing `sep` to `sys.stdout` means that `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `sep` appended to its current content. The previous value of `sys.stdout` was the value of `str(next_element_in_args)`, so after this operation, `sys.stdout` will contain `str(next_element_in_args) + sep`.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `str(next_element_in_args) + sep`.**
