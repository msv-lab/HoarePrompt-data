The code `depth[v] = depth[w] + 1` updates the value of `depth[v]` to be `depth[w] + 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `graph[v]` contains at least one element.
- `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph.
- `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`.
- If `not used[w_next]` is true, then `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w_next] + 1`, `post[v]` is set to `w_next`, `used[w_next]` is set to `True`, and `q` includes the value of `w_next`.

Since the condition `not used[w_next]` is true, the following actions would have been taken before this line of code:
- `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w_next] + 1`.
- `post[v]` is set to `w_next`.
- `used[w_next]` is set to `True`.
- `q` includes the value of `w_next`.

However, the code now sets `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1`, which implies that `w` is equivalent to `w_next` (since `w_next` was just used and `w`'s depth is not -1). Therefore, the previous assignment `depth[v] = depth[w_next] + 1` is being overridden by `depth[v] = depth[w] + 1`.

Thus, the new value of `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, and the other variables (`post[v]`, `used[w_next]`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their last state.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is `w_next`, `used[w_next]` is `True`, and `q` includes the value of `w_next`.**
