The provided code is a docstring and does not actually modify any variables. It simply describes the behavior of the `print` function. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **args is a variable-length argument list containing the values to be printed, and kwargs is a dictionary containing keyword arguments such as 'sep' for separator, 'file' for the output stream, 'end' for the trailing character to write after the last value, and 'flush' to flush the stream.**
