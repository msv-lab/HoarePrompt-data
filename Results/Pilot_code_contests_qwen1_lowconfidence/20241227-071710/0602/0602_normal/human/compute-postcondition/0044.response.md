Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, and `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`. If `depth[w]` is not -1 and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`), then `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is set to `w`, `used[w_next]` is set to `True`, and `q` includes the value of `w_next`. Otherwise, the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.***
