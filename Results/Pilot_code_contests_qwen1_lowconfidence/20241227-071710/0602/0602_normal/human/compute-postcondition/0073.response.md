Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `graph[v]` is a non-empty list.
- `v` is the next element from `q`.
- `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed.
- The element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed.
- If `used[w]` is `False`, then no changes are made to `depth[v]` or `post[v]`. Otherwise, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`.

### Loop Statement
```python
for w in graph[v]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `w` in `graph[v]`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, there must be at least one more element `w` in `graph[v]`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `graph[v]` is non-empty, meaning it has at least one element.
   - `v` is the next element from `q`.
   - `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed.
   - The element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed.
   - If `used[w]` is `False`, no changes are made to `depth[v]` or `post[v]`. Otherwise, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `graph[v]` is non-empty, it means there is at least one element in `graph[v]`. For the loop to execute, there needs to be at least one more element in `graph[v]` to process.
   - The element `v` is taken from `q`, and `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed.
   - After processing an element `w` in the loop, `v` will change to the next element in `graph[v]`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `graph[v]` remains non-empty but now `v` is the next element in `graph[v]` (let's call this new `v` as `v_new`).
- `q` still contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed.
- The element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` has not been fully processed.
- If `used[w]` is `False`, no changes are made to `depth[v_new]` or `post[v_new]`. Otherwise, `depth[v_new]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v_new]` is set to `w`.

### Adjusted States:
- `graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list.
- `v` becomes `v_new`, which is the next element in `graph[v]`.
- `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed.
- The element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` has not been fully processed.

### Final Answer
State: **`graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` has not been fully processed. If `used[w]` is `False`, then no changes are made to `depth[v_new]` or `post[v_new]`. Otherwise, `depth[v_new]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v_new]` is set to `w`.**
