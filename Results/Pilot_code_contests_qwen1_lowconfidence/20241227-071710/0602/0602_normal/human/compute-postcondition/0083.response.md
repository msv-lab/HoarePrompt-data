The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `graph`, which is a list of lists where `graph[v]` contains all the rooms directly connected to Room `v` through passages, and `start`, which is an integer representing the starting room (though it is fixed to 0 in the function call). The function returns a list `post`, which indicates the last vertex visited from each vertex during the traversal starting from `start`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `graph` (a list of lists) and `start` (an integer), and returns a list `post` indicating the last vertex visited from each vertex during the traversal starting from `start`.**
