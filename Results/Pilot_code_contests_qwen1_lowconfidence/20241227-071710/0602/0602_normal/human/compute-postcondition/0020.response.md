The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the following:

1. It pops the value associated with the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and writes it to `file`. Since `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, the default value `\n` is used.
2. The `file` variable is set to `sys.stdout`.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys.
- `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' '.
- `file` is `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `sys.stdout` now contains the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.

After executing the code:
- `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'` (it is popped).
- `sys.stdout` now contains the previously concatenated string plus the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, which is `\n`.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'end' and 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `sys.stdout` now contains the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `\n`.**
