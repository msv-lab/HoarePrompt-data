Postcondition: ***`graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, and `q` contains all its previous elements plus `w`. If `used[w]` is `False`, then `depth[v_new]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v_new]` is set to `w`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `depth[v_new]` or `post[v_new]`.***
