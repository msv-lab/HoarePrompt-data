Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`. If `depth[w]` is not -1 and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`), then `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is `w`. Otherwise, the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.***
