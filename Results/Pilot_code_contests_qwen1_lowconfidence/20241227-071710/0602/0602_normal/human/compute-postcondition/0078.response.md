The code appends `w` to the list `q`. Based on the initial state, `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` has not been fully processed. After appending `w` to `q`, `q` will now contain all its previous elements plus `w`.

- `graph[v_new]` remains a non-empty list.
- `v` remains the next element from `q`.
- `used[w]` remains `True`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains all its previous elements plus `w`, and `used[w]` is `True`.

Output State: **`graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains all its previous elements plus `w`, and `used[w]` is `True`.**
