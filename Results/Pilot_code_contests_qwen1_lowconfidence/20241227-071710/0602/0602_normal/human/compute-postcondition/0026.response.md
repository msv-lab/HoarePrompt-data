The function `func_3(i + 1)` is called, which changes the state by calling `func_3` with the argument `i + 1`. However, the actual implementation of `func_3` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact changes made by this function call. The only change we can definitively state is that `func_3` is called with `i + 1`.

Given the initial state where `i` must be within the range of `post`, and `i + 1` must also be within the range of `post`, and considering that no local variables are modified within the given snippet, the only information we can provide is the function call itself.

Output State: **`i` is within the range of `post`, `i + 1` is within the range of `post`, and `func_3(i + 1)` has been called.**
