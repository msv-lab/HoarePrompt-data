Postcondition: **`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'end', 'sep', and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `sys.stdout` now contains the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `\n`. The result of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is taken, and if it is `True`, `sys.stdout.flush()` is called.**
