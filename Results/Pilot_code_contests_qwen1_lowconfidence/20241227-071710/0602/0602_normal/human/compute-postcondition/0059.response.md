`depth[v]` is assigned the value `depth[w] + 1`. According to the precondition, `depth[w]` is not equal to -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is equal to -1. Since `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`, `depth[v]` will now be `depth[w] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed; `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`; `w` is a node such that `depth[w]` is not equal to -1 and either `depth[w]` is less than `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` is equal to -1.**
