`post[v]` is assigned the value `w`. This means that the value of `post[v]` is now `w`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `post[v]` and retains the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, `used[w_next]` is `False`, `post[v]` is `w`, and the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged unless `used[w]` is `False`.**
