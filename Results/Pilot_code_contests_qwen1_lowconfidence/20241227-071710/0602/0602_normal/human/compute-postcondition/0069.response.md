Postcondition: **`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed. If `depth[w]` is not -1 and (`depth[w]` < `depth[v]` or `depth[v]` == -1), then `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is `w`.**
