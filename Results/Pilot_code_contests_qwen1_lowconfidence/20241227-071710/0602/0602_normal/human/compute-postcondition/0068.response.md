The code `post[v] = w` assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. The variable `v` is the next element from `q`, and `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed, the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed, and `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`; `post[v]` is `w`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one element that has not been fully processed, the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed, and `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`; `post[v]` is `w`.**
