`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The variables `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, and the content of `sys.stdout` remain unchanged from their previous states. 

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `str(next_element_in_args) + sep + str(x)`, `at_start` is `False`.**
