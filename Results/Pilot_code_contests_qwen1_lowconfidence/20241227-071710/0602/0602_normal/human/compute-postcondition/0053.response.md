The code `q.append(w)` appends the value of `w` to the list `q`. This means that `w` is added to the end of the queue `q`. The values of `graph[v]`, `v`, `w_next`, `used[w_next]`, `depth[w]`, `depth[v]`, and `post[v]` are not directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial conditions:
- `graph[v]` contains at least one element,
- `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph,
- `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is now `True`.

If `depth[w]` is not -1 and (`depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`), then `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`. Otherwise, the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.

Since the condition for updating `depth[v]` and `post[v]` is not specified in the given code snippet, we assume that the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged as per the provided conditions.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is now `True`, `q` has appended `w` to its end.**
