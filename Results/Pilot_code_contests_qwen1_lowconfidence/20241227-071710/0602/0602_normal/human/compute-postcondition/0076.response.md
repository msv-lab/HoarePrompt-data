Postcondition: **`graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` has not been fully processed. If `depth[w]` is not `-1` and either `depth[w] < depth[v]` or `depth[v] == -1`, then `depth[v_new]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v_new]` is set to `w`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `depth[v_new]` or `post[v_new]`.**
