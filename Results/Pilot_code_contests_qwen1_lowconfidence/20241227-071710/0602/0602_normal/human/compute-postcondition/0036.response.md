Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and either its depth is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1. If the condition is met, `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`. Otherwise, the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.***
