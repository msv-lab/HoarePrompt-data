The code `depth[v] = depth[w] + 1` updates the value of `depth[v]` to be the value of `depth[w]` plus 1. The variable `v`'s depth is set to the depth of `w` plus 1, while the other conditions and the value of `w` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must contain at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and either its depth is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1; `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`.**
