The code `q.append(w)` appends the value of `w` to the list `q`. The value of `w` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that `w` is a valid element that should be added to `q`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed, `used[w]` is `True`, and the update of `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` being `w` is preserved if applicable.**
