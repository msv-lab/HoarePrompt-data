`used[w]` is assigned the value `True`. According to the precondition, `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`. The value of `used[w_next]` remains unaffected since `w` is not necessarily equal to `w_next`. The value of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged unless certain conditions are met, which are not triggered by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, and `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`. `used[w]` is `True`, and the values of `depth[v]`, `post[v]`, and `used[w_next]` remain unchanged.
