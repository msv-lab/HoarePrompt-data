Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, and `w` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1. If the condition `not used[w]` is true, then `depth[v]` is set to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`, `used[w]` is set to `True`, and `q` includes the value of `w`. Otherwise, the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.***
