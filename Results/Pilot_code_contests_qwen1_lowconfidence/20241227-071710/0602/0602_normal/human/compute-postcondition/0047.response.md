Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, and `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`. If `used[w]` is `False`, `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged, and `q` now contains `w` appended to its previous elements. Otherwise, the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.***
