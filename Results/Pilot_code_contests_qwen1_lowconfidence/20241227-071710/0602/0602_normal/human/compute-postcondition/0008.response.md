`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The previous value of `at_start` is `False`, so it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `str(x)` written to it.
