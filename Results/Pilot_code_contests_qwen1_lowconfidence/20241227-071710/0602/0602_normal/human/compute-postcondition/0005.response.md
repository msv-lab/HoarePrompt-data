`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. Since `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` returns either `sys.stdout` or the original value of `file` if `file` is present in `kwargs`, and `kwargs` does not contain 'file', `file` is set to `sys.stdout`. The value of `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or the default value ' ' if `sep` was not in `kwargs`. After writing `sep` to `sys.stdout`, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` contains the value of `sep` written to it.**
