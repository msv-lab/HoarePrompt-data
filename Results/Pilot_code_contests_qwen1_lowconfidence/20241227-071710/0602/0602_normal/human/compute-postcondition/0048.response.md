Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `graph[v]` contains at least one element.
   - `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph.
   - `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`.
   - If `used[w]` is `False`, then `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged, and `q` now contains `w` appended to its previous elements. Otherwise, the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each vertex `w` in `graph[v]`.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one vertex `w` left in `graph[v]` that satisfies the conditions:
   - `depth[w]` is not -1.
   - `used[w]` is `False`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `w_next` was used in the previous iteration, it means `used[w_next]` is now `True`.
   - We need to find the next `w` in `graph[v]` that satisfies the conditions (`depth[w]` is not -1 and `used[w]` is `False`).

5. **New State**:
   - `graph[v]` still contains at least one element (since the loop can execute again).
   - `v` remains a valid vertex index in the graph.
   - `w_next` is updated to the next vertex in `graph[v]` that satisfies the conditions.
   - `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged unless `w` (the next vertex) is processed in this iteration.
   - `q` now contains the next vertex `w` appended to its previous elements if `used[w]` is `False`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`. If `used[w]` is `False`, `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged, and `q` now contains `w` appended to its previous elements. Otherwise, the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged.**
