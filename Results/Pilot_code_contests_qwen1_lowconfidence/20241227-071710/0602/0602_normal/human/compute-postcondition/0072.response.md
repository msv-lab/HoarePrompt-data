Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed, and the element in `q` corresponding to `v` has not been fully processed. If `used[w]` is `False`, then no changes are made to `depth[v]` or `post[v]`. Otherwise, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`.***
