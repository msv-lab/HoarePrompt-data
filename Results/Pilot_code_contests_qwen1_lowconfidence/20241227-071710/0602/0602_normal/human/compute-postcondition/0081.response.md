Output State: **`graph` is a list of lists, `used` is a list indicating whether each vertex has been visited, `q` is a list of vertices, `depth` is a list indicating the depth of each vertex in the traversal, and `post` is a list indicating the last vertex visited from each vertex. All elements in `used` are boolean values, all elements in `q` are integers, all elements in `depth` and `post` are integers. After the loop executes, every vertex that can be reached from `start` will have its `depth` and `post` values set correctly, and `used` will be `True` for all visited vertices. `q` will contain all the vertices that were added during the traversal, and the loop ensures that all reachable vertices are processed. If no vertex is reachable from `start`, the values of `used`, `q`, `depth`, and `post` remain as initially set.**
