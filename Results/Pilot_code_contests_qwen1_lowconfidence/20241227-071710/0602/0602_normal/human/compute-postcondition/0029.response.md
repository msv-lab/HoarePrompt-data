Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `graph`. It reads these parameters from the input, constructs a graph represented as a list of lists, and then calls another function `func_1` with this graph. If the result of `func_1` contains `-1`, it prints "No" and returns immediately. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the indices of the nodes in the graph as determined by `func_1`, excluding `-1`. The function does not return any value itself.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
1. The function assumes that the input values for `n` and `m` are within the specified ranges. If these inputs are out of bounds, the function will not handle them explicitly.
2. The function does not provide any error handling for invalid inputs or malformed graph data. For example, if the graph is not properly constructed due to incorrect input data, the function will proceed with the erroneous graph.
3. The function does not specify the exact operations performed by `func_1` or `func_3`, so we can only infer that `func_1` likely performs some kind of analysis on the graph, and `func_3` prints its arguments.
