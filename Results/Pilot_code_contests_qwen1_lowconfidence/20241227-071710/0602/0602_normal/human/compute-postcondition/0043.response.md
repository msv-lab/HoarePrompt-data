The code `post[v] = w` updates the value of `post[v]` to `w`. According to the initial state, `post[v]` was equal to `w_next`. So, `post[v]` is now updated to `w_next`.

The other variables (`graph[v]`, `v`, `w_next`, `used[w_next]`, `depth[v]`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, `post[v]` is `w`, `used[w_next]` is `True`, and `q` includes the value of `w_next`.**
