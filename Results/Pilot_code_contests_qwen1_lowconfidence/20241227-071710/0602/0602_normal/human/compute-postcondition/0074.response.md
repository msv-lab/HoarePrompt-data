The code updates the value of `depth[v]` to `depth[w] + 1`. Here's the breakdown:

- The initial state is given as follows:
  - `graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list.
  - `v` is the next element from `q`.
  - `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed.
  - The element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` has not been fully processed.
  - If `used[w]` is `False`, then no changes are made to `depth[v_new]` or `post[v_new]`. Otherwise, `depth[v_new]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v_new]` is set to `w`.

Since `used[w]` is not specified as `False` in this case, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`.

The output state is:
- `graph[v_new]` remains a non-empty list.
- `v` remains the next element from `q`.
- `q` remains containing at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed.
- The element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` remains not fully processed.
- `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1`.
- `post[v_new]` remains unchanged (as no update was made).

Output State: **`graph[v_new]` is a non-empty list, `v` is the next element from `q`, `q` contains at least one additional element `w` that has not been fully processed, the element in `q` corresponding to `v_new` has not been fully processed, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, and `post[v_new]` remains unchanged.**
