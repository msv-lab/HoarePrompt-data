To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the `for` loop in the given code snippet can start iterating over the `args` variable-length argument list.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **args**: The `args` variable is a variable-length argument list. For the loop to start executing, `args` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `args` is a non-empty sequence.

2. **kwargs**: The `kwargs` dictionary should not affect the loop's execution directly since it's only used to initialize the `sep` and `file` variables. However, we need to confirm that the loop initialization doesn't get interrupted by `kwargs`.

3. **sep**: This variable is initialized as `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which means it will take the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `kwargs` contains the key `'sep'`, otherwise it defaults to `' '`. This initialization does not prevent the loop from executing, so no specific adjustment is needed for this variable regarding the loop's execution.

4. **file**: Similarly, `file` is initialized as `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, which means it will take the value of `kwargs['file']` if `kwargs` contains the key `'file'`, otherwise it defaults to `sys.stdout`. Like `sep`, this initialization does not prevent the loop from executing, so no specific adjustment is needed for this variable regarding the loop's execution.

5. **at_start**: The boolean `at_start` being `True` at the start indicates the beginning of the function or loop but does not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the `args` content.

Given these considerations, the critical adjustment needed is ensuring that `args` is not empty.

State: **`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, kwargs is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, sep is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')` which is either ' ' or the original value of 'sep' if present, file is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` which is either `sys.stdout` or the original value of 'file' if present, at_start is `True`**.
