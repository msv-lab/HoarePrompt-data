The code assigns the value of `w` to `post[v]`. Based on the initial state, `graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and either its depth is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1, and `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`. The assignment does not affect the values of `graph[v]`, `v`, or the condition of `depth[v]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[v]` must contain at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and either its depth is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1; `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`; `post[v]` is `w`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` must contain at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and either its depth is less than the depth of `v` or the depth of `v` is -1; `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`; `post[v]` is `w`.**
