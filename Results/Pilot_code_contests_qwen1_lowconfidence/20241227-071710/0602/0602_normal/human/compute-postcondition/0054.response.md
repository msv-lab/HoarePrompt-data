Postcondition: ***`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, and `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1. If `used[w]` is `False`, then `used[w]` is set to `True`, `q` appends `w` to its end, and the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged. If `used[w]` is already `True`, the values of `depth[v]`, `post[v]`, `q`, and `used[w]` remain unchanged.***
