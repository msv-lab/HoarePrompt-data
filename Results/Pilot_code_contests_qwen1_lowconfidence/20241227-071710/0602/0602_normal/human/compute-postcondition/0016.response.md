Postcondition: ***`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list with the first element removed, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `str(next_element_in_args) + sep + sep + str(x)`, regardless of whether `at_start` is `True` or `False`.***
