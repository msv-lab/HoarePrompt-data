Postcondition: ***`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'end', 'sep', and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and if the key 'flush' is `True` in `kwargs`, the output is flushed to `sys.stdout`. Otherwise, the output remains as is.***
