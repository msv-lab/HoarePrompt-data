Output State: **`graph[v]` is a non-empty list, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, and `w` is any vertex in `graph[v]`. If `used[w]` is `False`, `depth[v]` is updated to `depth[w] + 1` and `post[v]` is set to `w`. `used[w]` is set to `True`, and `w` is appended to `q`. If `used[w]` is already `True`, the values of `depth[v]`, `post[v]`, `q`, and `used[w]` remain unchanged. After all iterations, every vertex in `graph[v]` that is reachable and not yet visited will have its depth updated, `post` updated, and will be added to `q`. If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `graph[v]` is empty), then `depth[v]` remains `-1`, `post[v]` remains the same, and `q` remains unchanged.**
