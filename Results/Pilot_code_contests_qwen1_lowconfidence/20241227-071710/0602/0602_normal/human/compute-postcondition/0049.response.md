The code `depth[v] = depth[w] + 1` updates the value of `depth[v]` to be `depth[w] + 1`. According to the initial state, `depth[w]` is not -1 and is a valid value. The values of `graph[v]`, `v`, `w_next`, `used[w_next]`, `used[w]`, `depth[v]`, `post[v]`, and `q` remain unchanged unless directly modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the only change is that `depth[v]` is updated to be `depth[w] + 1`.

Output State: **`graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`, `depth[v]` is `depth[w] + 1`, `used[w_next]` is `False`, and the values of `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged unless `used[w]` is `False`.**
