The code `q.append(w)` appends the vertex `w` to the list `q`. The value of `w` is such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `graph[v]` contains at least one element, `v` is a valid vertex index in the graph, and `w_next` is a vertex such that its depth is not -1 and `used[w_next]` is `False`; `used[w]` is `False`; `depth[v]` and `post[v]` remain unchanged; `q` now contains `w` appended to its previous elements.
