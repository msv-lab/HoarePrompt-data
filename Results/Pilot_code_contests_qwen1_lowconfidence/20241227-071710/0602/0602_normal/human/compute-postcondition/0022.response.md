The code `file.flush()` calls the `flush` method on the `file` variable, which is `sys.stdout` in this case. This operation does not change the value of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. However, it ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal. Since `sys.stdout` now contains the concatenated string of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `\n`, and `flush` is called, the output is immediately sent to the terminal.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'end', 'sep', and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the output is flushed to `sys.stdout`.**
