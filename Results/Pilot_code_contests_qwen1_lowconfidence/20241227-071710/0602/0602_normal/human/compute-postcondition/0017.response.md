The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. According to the initial state, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`, which means `x` is written to `sys.stdout`. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: *`args` is a non-empty variable-length argument list with the first element removed, `kwargs` is a dictionary without 'sep' and 'file' keys, `sep` is either the original value of `sep` if it was present in `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `sys.stdout` now contains the value of `str(x)`.
