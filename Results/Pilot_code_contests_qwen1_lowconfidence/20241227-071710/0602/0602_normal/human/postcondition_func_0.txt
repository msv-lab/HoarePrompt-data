The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `graph`, a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a graph where `graph[v]` contains all the rooms directly connected to Room `v`, and `start`, an integer representing the starting room (which is fixed to 0). It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal starting from the `start` room to determine the last room visited from each room during the traversal. The function returns a list `post` where `post[v]` indicates the last room visited from Room `v`. 

If no vertex is reachable from the `start` room, the function will still return a list of `-1` for all rooms, indicating that no room was visited from those rooms. The function sets the `depth` of the `start` room to 0 and marks it as visited. For each room `v` in the queue, it updates the `depth` and `post` values for its neighbors `w` if they haven't been visited yet. This process continues until all reachable rooms are processed.
