Final: **True**

Reasoning:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program uses a BFS approach to ensure that the signposts lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.
- The `func_1` function performs a BFS starting from Room 1, calculating the shortest paths to all other rooms and storing the parent of each node.
- The `func_2` function constructs the graph, calls `func_1`, and processes the results, ensuring that all rooms except Room 1 have a valid parent.
- The `func_3` function prints the output in the required format, handling various keyword arguments appropriately.
- The output hints confirm that `func_3` behaves as expected, printing the concatenated string of values separated by a specified separator and ending with a specified trailing character, while also handling potential edge cases like empty inputs.
- Given the BFS approach and the proper handling of outputs, the program correctly meets the problem description and the output hints support this correctness.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed correct.
