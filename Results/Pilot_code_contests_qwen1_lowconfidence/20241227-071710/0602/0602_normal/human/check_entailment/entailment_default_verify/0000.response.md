Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly implements the solution by using BFS to find the shortest paths from each room to Room 1 and then placing signposts accordingly. The BFS ensures that the path taken is the shortest possible, and the `post` array effectively represents the signposts needed for each room.

The `func_3` function simply handles the printing of the results to the standard output stream, as described by the output hints. It correctly prints the required information without any issues, and it handles various edge cases such as empty `args` or `kwargs` gracefully.

Given that the BFS logic is sound and the printing function behaves as expected, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints confirm its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
