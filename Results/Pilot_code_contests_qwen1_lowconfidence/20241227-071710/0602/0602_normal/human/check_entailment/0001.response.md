Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
- The program correctly identifies whether it's possible to place signposts such that starting from any room (except Room 1) and following the signposts leads to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.
- It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms.
- The function `func_1` performs BFS and calculates the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms, storing the parent of each node in the `post` list.
- The function `func_2` constructs the graph, calls `func_1`, and processes the results.
- If any room does not have a valid parent (indicated by -1 in the `post` list), the program outputs "No", indicating that it's not possible to place the signposts as required.
- Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by the signpost directions for each room.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to handle all cases correctly. The BFS ensures that the shortest path is found, and the parent pointers are used to reconstruct the path back to Room 1. Thus, the program is correct.
