Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly implements a breadth-first search (BFS) to determine the shortest paths from Room 1 to all other rooms and sets up the signposts accordingly. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs the graph correctly using the input data. Each room is represented as an index in the `graph` list, and passages are added as connections between these rooms.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The `func_1` function performs a BFS starting from Room 1 (index 0 in the graph). It correctly calculates the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms and sets the `post` array to indicate the last room visited from each room. This ensures that following the signposts will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.

3. **Checking Validity**: In `func_2`, the program checks if the `post` array contains `-1`, which would indicate that not all rooms are reachable from Room 1. If `-1` is found, it prints "No" and returns. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" followed by the signpost directions.

4. **Printing Results**: The `func_3` function is responsible for printing the results. It correctly formats the output based on the provided `post` array, ensuring that each room (except Room 1) has a valid signpost directing to a reachable room.

Based on the annotations and the logical flow of the program, the implementation adheres to the problem description and the BFS approach guarantees that the conditions are met. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed correct.
