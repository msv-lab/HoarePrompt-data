Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly determine the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not return the correct path from each room to Room 1 with the minimum number of passages. Instead, it returns the last room visited during a BFS traversal, which does not necessarily satisfy the requirement that reaching Room 1 must be done with the minimum number of passages. Additionally, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the path from each room to Room 1 is the shortest possible. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
