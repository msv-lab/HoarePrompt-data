Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly constructs the graph from the input, where each room is connected to other rooms via passages.
   - The graph is represented as a list of lists, and each passage is bidirectional, which matches the problem description.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - The `func_1` function performs a BFS starting from Room 1 (vertex 0 in the list representation).
   - The `post` list is populated with the last visited vertex for each vertex, effectively storing the parent pointers.
   - The BFS ensures that the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms is calculated correctly.

3. **Post-processing**:
   - After obtaining the `post` list, the program checks if any vertex has -1 in the `post` list. If any vertex does, it means that vertex cannot be reached from Room 1, and thus the signpost placement is invalid.
   - If all vertices have valid parent pointers, the program outputs "Yes" followed by the signpost directions for each room.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The `func_3` function handles the output correctly, ensuring that the signpost directions are printed in the required format.

The annotations confirm that the BFS algorithm is implemented correctly and that the program adheres to the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed correct.
