Final: **True**

### Reasoning:

Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program correctly constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given passages. This is evident from the loops where edges are added to the `graph` list.

2. **BFS Implementation**: The `func_1` function implements a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from Room 1 to all other rooms. The `post` array, which stores the parent nodes for each room, is correctly updated. This ensures that each room points to the correct next room in the shortest path to Room 1.

3. **Validation and Output**: The `func_2` function checks if the `post` array contains any `-1` values, which would indicate an unreachable room. If all values are valid (no `-1`), it prints "Yes" followed by the correct signpost for each room. This ensures that the program only outputs a valid solution if it exists.

4. **Annotations Confirm Correctness**: The annotations provided in the annotated version confirm that the program correctly processes the input and performs the necessary BFS traversal to generate the signposts. Each step of the BFS is clearly described, and the final output is validated to ensure all signposts lead to Room 1.

5. **Edge Cases**: While the annotations assume valid input, the program correctly handles edge cases by ensuring that all rooms can be reached from Room 1 and that the signposts form the shortest path.

Given that the program correctly constructs the graph, performs the BFS to find the shortest paths, and validates the results before printing the signposts, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate, and the final assessment remains **True**.
