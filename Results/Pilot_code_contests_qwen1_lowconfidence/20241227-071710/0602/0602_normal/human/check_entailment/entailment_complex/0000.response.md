Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not handle the case where the graph is not a tree (i.e., it contains cycles). The problem description states that one can travel between any two rooms by traversing passages, implying that the graph is a connected graph without cycles. However, the code does not check for cycles or ensure that the resulting traversal leads to Room 1 after traversing the minimum number of passages possible for each room.

Here's a case where the code fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2
```

The graph here forms a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2. According to the problem description, the signpost in each room should point to a room such that starting from that room and following the signposts will eventually lead to Room 1 with the minimum number of passages. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not ensure this condition is met when there are cycles.

In the given example, if we run the code, it will output:
```
Yes
2
3
3
```

This output is incorrect because starting from Room 2, following the signpost (Room 3) will not lead to Room 1 with the minimum number of passages. The correct output should be:
```
Yes
1
2
2
```

This is because the correct signposts should be set such that each room points to the room that is part of the shortest path to Room 1, which in this case would be Room 1 for all rooms except Room 1 itself.

To fix this, the code needs to ensure that the graph is acyclic and that the traversal from each room leads to Room 1 with the minimum number of passages. This can be achieved by using a more sophisticated algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) with cycle detection or Topological Sorting, to ensure that the graph is a tree before setting the signposts.
