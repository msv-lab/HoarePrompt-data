Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the required logic for determining and printing the signpost placements. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to perform a BFS and return the last room visited from each room, which does not necessarily meet the requirement that starting from any room and repeatedly moving to the room indicated by the signpost should reach Room 1 in the minimum number of steps.

The function `func_1` returns the `post` array, which represents the last room visited from each room during the BFS. However, this does not guarantee that the path to Room 1 is the shortest. For example, consider the following input:

```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2
```

The correct signpost placements would be `[1, 1, 2, 2]`, because starting from any room other than Room 1 and following the signposts will lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not ensure this.

To fix this, the BFS should not only track the last visited room but also keep track of the distance to Room 1 and the parent room for each room. Here is a modified version of `func_1` that correctly implements the required logic:

```python
def func_1(graph, start=0):
    from collections import deque
    n = len(graph)
    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    dist[start] = 0
    parent = [-1] * n
    queue = deque([start])
    
    while queue:
        v = queue.popleft()
        for w in graph[v]:
            if dist[w] > dist[v] + 1:
                dist[w] = dist[v] + 1
                parent[w] = v
                queue.append(w)
                
    # Reconstruct the paths
    post = [-1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        v = i
        while v != -1:
            post[v] = v
            v = parent[v]
            
    return post[1:]  # Exclude the starting room (Room 1)
```

This modified `func_1` ensures that the signpost placements lead to Room 1 in the minimum number of steps. However, the provided code does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
