Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem of placing signposts in each room (except Room 1) such that starting from any room and following the signposts leads to Room 1 after traversing the minimum number of passages possible. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Graph Representation**: The program constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given passages.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: It uses BFS to find the shortest path from each room to Room 1. The `func_1` function implements BFS and returns the parent nodes (`post`) which represent the signposts.
3. **Validation and Output**: The `func_2` function validates the result and prints the signpost for each room.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided code seems to correctly implement the BFS approach to find the shortest paths. The BFS ensures that the path taken is the shortest possible, and the `post` array effectively represents the signposts needed.

Since the code handles all rooms correctly and follows the BFS approach which guarantees the shortest path, it satisfies the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
