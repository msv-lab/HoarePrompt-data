You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have N weights indexed 1 to N. The mass of the weight indexed i is W_i.

We will divide these weights into two groups: the weights with indices not greater than T, and those with indices greater than T, for some integer 1 \leq T < N. Let S_1 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the former group, and S_2 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the latter group.

Consider all possible such divisions and find the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq W_i \leq 100
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
W_1 W_2 ... W_{N-1} W_N


Output

Print the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100, and W is a list of N integers such that 1 <= W_i <= 100 for all i in range(N).
def func():
    N = input()
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = 1000000000.0
    for i in range(1, len(V)):
        diff = abs(sum(V[:i]) - sum(V[i:]))
        
        if M > diff:
            M = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` must be at least 2, `V` contains at least 2 elements, `M` is the minimum absolute difference between the sum of any prefix and suffix of `V`.
    print(M)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
