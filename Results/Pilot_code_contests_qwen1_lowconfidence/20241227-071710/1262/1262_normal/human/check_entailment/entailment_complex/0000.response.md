Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program takes an integer \( N \) as the first input and a list of \( N \) integers \( W \) as the second input.
   - The constraints for \( N \) and \( W_i \) are handled, ensuring that \( 2 \leq N \leq 100 \) and \( 1 \leq W_i \leq 100 \).

2. **Calculation of Minimum Absolute Difference**:
   - The program iterates through all possible divisions of the list \( V \) (where \( V \) is equivalent to \( W \)) into a prefix and a suffix.
   - For each division, it calculates the sum of the prefix and the sum of the suffix.
   - It keeps track of the minimum absolute difference between these sums.
   - The final result is the minimum absolute difference, which is printed to the console.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where \( N < 2 \). However, since the problem statement specifies \( 2 \leq N \leq 100 \), this edge case is inherently covered.
   - The program also ensures that the list \( V \) has at least 2 elements, as required by the problem statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum possible absolute difference of \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \), as described in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
