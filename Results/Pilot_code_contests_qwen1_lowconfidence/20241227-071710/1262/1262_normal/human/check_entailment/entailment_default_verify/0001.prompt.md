You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have N weights indexed 1 to N. The mass of the weight indexed i is W_i.

We will divide these weights into two groups: the weights with indices not greater than T, and those with indices greater than T, for some integer 1 \leq T < N. Let S_1 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the former group, and S_2 be the sum of the masses of the weights in the latter group.

Consider all possible such divisions and find the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq W_i \leq 100
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
W_1 W_2 ... W_{N-1} W_N


Output

Print the minimum possible absolute difference of S_1 and S_2.

Program:

def func():
    N = input()
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = 1000000000.0
    for i in range(1, len(V)):
        diff = abs(sum(V[:i]) - sum(V[i:]))
        if M > diff:
            M = diff
    print(M)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum possible absolute difference of \(S_1\) and \(S_2\). The issue arises because the program uses the `input()` function twice, which reads the value of \(N\) as a string instead of an integer. This will cause a runtime error since `len(V)` will be the length of the string representation of \(N\), leading to incorrect indexing.

To fix this, the program should read the value of \(N\) as an integer. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())  # Read N as an integer
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, len(V)):
        diff = abs(sum(V[:i]) - sum(V[i:]))
        if M > diff:
            M = diff
    print(M)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that \(N\) is read as an integer and the rest of the logic remains the same. With this fix, the program should correctly calculate the minimum possible absolute difference of \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) for any valid input.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts no parameters directly but reads two inputs: an integer \( N \) and a list of \( N \) integers \( V \). It calculates the minimum absolute difference between the sum of any prefix and suffix of the list \( V \), and prints this minimum difference. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable \( M \) holds the minimum absolute difference found during the iteration over the list \( V \), and it is printed to the console. The function assumes that the input values are within the specified ranges, and it handles the case where \( N \geq 2 \) and \( V \) has at least 2 elements. If \( N < 2 \), the function would not execute the loop and would not print anything, which is an edge case that the current code does not handle explicitly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
