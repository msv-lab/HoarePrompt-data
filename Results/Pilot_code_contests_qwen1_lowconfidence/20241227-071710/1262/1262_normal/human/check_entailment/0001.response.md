Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum possible absolute difference of \(S_1\) and \(S_2\). The issue arises because the program uses the `input()` function twice, which reads the value of \(N\) as a string instead of an integer. This will cause a runtime error since `len(V)` will be the length of the string representation of \(N\), leading to incorrect indexing.

To fix this, the program should read the value of \(N\) as an integer. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())  # Read N as an integer
    V = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, len(V)):
        diff = abs(sum(V[:i]) - sum(V[i:]))
        if M > diff:
            M = diff
    print(M)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that \(N\) is read as an integer and the rest of the logic remains the same. With this fix, the program should correctly calculate the minimum possible absolute difference of \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) for any valid input.
