Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program attempts to find the minimum possible absolute difference between the sums of two groups by iterating through the list and calculating the difference between the sum of elements before the current index and the sum of elements after the current index. However, this approach only considers the division at each individual index and does not explore all possible divisions.

For instance, consider the input:

```
3
1 2 3
```

The program would calculate the differences for `T = 1` and `T = 2`:
- For `T = 1`: `S1 = 1`, `S2 = 2 + 3 = 5`, difference = `|1 - 5| = 4`
- For `T = 2`: `S1 = 1 + 2 = 3`, `S2 = 3`, difference = `|3 - 3| = 0`

However, the correct minimum difference should be found by considering all possible values of `T` from 1 to `N-1`. The program should iterate over all possible values of `T` and compute the sums for both groups, then find the minimum difference among all these divisions.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate over all possible values of `T` from 1 to `N-1`, calculate the sums `S1` and `S2` for each division, and keep track of the minimum difference. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    N = int(input())
    W = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_sum = sum(W)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    left_sum = 0
    for T in range(1, N):
        left_sum += W[T-1]
        right_sum = total_sum - left_sum
        diff = abs(left_sum - right_sum)
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    
    print(min_diff)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that all possible divisions are considered and finds the minimum possible absolute difference of `S1` and `S2`.
