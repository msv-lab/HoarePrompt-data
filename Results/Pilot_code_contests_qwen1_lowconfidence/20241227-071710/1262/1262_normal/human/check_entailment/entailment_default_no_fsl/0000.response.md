Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the input list length \(N\) is less than 2. According to the problem description, the constraints specify \(2 \leq N \leq 100\), but the code does not check for this condition and will not execute the loop if \(N < 2\). This means that if \(N = 1\), the code will not run the loop and will not produce any output, failing to meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
