The code `M = diff` assigns the value of `diff` to `M`. This means that the value of `M` is now equal to `diff`. The other variables (`N`, `V`, and `diff`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 2, `V` contains at least 2 elements, `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`, `M` is equal to `diff`**
