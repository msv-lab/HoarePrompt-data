The code `print(M)` simply prints the value of `M`. The value of `M` is the minimum absolute difference between the sum of any prefix and suffix of `V`, but the code itself does not change the value of `M`. Therefore, the output of the code is just the print statement displaying the value of `M`.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 2, `V` contains at least 2 elements, `M` is the minimum absolute difference between the sum of any prefix and suffix of `V`, `M` is printed**
