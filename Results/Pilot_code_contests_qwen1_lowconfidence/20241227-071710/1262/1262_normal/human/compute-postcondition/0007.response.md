Postcondition: **`N` must be at least 2, `V` contains at least 2 elements, `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`. If `M` is greater than `diff`, then `M` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.**
