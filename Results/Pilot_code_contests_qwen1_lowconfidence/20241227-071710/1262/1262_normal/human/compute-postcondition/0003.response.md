To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(1, len(V)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's break down the requirements for the loop to start:

1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over indices from 1 to `len(V) - 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `len(V)` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts at `i=1`).

2. **Variables Provided**:
   - `N` is an integer representing the number of elements to be assigned to `V`.
   - `W` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `V` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input.
   - `M` is 1000000000.0 (this variable is not directly relevant to the loop condition).

Given these points, we need to ensure that `len(V)` is at least 2 for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the initial state are:
- `N` must be at least 2 to ensure `len(V)` is at least 2.
- `V` must contain at least 2 elements (so `len(V) >= 2`).

State: **`N` must be at least 2, `V` must contain at least 2 elements**
