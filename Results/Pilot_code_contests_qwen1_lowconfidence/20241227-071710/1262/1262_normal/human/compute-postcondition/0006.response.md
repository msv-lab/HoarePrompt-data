`M` is assigned the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`. The conditions that `N` must be at least 2 and `V` contains at least 2 elements remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be at least 2, `V` contains at least 2 elements, `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`, `M` is equal to `diff`.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 2, `V` contains at least 2 elements, `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`, `M` is equal to `diff`.**
