The function `func` accepts a parameter `N`, which is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100, and a parameter `W`, which is a list of N integers such that 1 <= W_i <= 100 for all i in range(N). 

The output has two cases:
- Case_1: `W` is a list of N integers such that 1 <= W_i <= 100 for all i in range(N), and the function returns an unspecified value (the specific value is not provided in the problem statement).
- Case_2: The function returns an unspecified value (the specific value is not provided in the problem statement).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `N` and a list `W` of N integers, and return an unspecified value based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter N (an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100) and a parameter W (a list of N integers such that 1 <= W_i <= 100 for all i in range(N)), and returns an unspecified value.**
