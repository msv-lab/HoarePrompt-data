`N` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads an integer from the user. The precondition that `2 <= N <= 100` is maintained because the code only assigns the input value to `N`. However, since the actual value of `N` depends on user input, it is represented as `input()`.

Output State: **`N` is input(), `W` is a list of N integers such that 1 <= W_i <= 100 for all i in range(N)**
