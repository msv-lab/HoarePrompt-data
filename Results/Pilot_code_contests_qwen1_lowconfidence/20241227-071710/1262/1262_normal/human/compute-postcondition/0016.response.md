Output State: **`N` must be at least 2, `V` contains at least 2 elements, `M` is the minimum absolute difference between the sum of any prefix and suffix of `V`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Conditions**: 
  - `N` is a single integer representing the number of elements to be assigned to `V`.
  - `W` is a list of `N` integers (though `W` is not used in the loop, so it doesn't affect the final state).
  - `V` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input.
  - `M` is initially set to 1000000000.0.

- **Loop Operation**:
  - The loop iterates over the indices of `V` starting from 1 to `len(V) - 1`.
  - For each index `i`, the loop calculates the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements (`sum(V[:i])`) and the sum of the remaining elements (`sum(V[i:])`).
  - The variable `M` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and the calculated difference `diff`.

- **Final State**:
  - After the loop completes, `M` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between the sum of any prefix and suffix of `V`.
  - The value of `V` itself and the length `N` of `V` remain unchanged.
  - Since the loop iterates from 1 to `len(V) - 1`, `N` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute even once.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is that `M` is the minimum absolute difference between the sum of any prefix and suffix of `V`.
