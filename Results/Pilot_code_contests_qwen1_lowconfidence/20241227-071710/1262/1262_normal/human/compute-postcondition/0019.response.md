Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but reads two inputs: an integer \( N \) and a list of \( N \) integers \( V \). It calculates the minimum absolute difference between the sum of any prefix and suffix of the list \( V \), and prints this minimum difference. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable \( M \) holds the minimum absolute difference found during the iteration over the list \( V \), and it is printed to the console. The function assumes that the input values are within the specified ranges, and it handles the case where \( N \geq 2 \) and \( V \) has at least 2 elements. If \( N < 2 \), the function would not execute the loop and would not print anything, which is an edge case that the current code does not handle explicitly.**
