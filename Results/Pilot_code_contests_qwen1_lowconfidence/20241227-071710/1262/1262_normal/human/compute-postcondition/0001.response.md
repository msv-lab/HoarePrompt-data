The code `V = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `V`. Since `N` was previously set to the result of `input()`, `N` is now a single integer representing the number of elements in the list that will be assigned to `V`. The values of `W` and `N` are not directly used in the assignment of `V`, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a single integer representing the number of elements to be assigned to `V`; `W` is a list of `N` integers such that 1 <= `W_i` <= 100 for all `i` in range(`N`); `V` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input.**
