Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `N` must be at least 2.
   - `V` contains at least 2 elements.
   - `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`.
   - If `M` is greater than `diff`, then `M` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(V) - 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state after the loop has completed its previous iteration.
   - Since the loop starts at `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each time, if the loop just finished, `i` would be the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `k`. Therefore, `i` is now `k + 1`.
   - The new `diff` is calculated based on the new `i` value.
   - The condition `if M > diff` is checked with the new `diff`.

5. **New State**:
   - `N` must still be at least 2.
   - `V` still contains at least 2 elements.
   - `diff` is now the absolute difference between the sum of the first `k + 1` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`.
   - If `M` is greater than `diff`, `M` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `M` takes the value of `diff`.

Given this, we can summarize the new state as follows:

State: **`N` must be at least 2, `V` contains at least 2 elements, `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `k + 1` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`, if `M` is greater than `diff`, then `M` remains unchanged, otherwise, `M` is set to `diff`**. 

To be specific about the exact values:
- `N` must be at least 2.
- `V` contains at least 2 elements.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `k + 1` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`.
- If `M` is greater than `diff`, `M` remains unchanged; otherwise, `M` is set to `diff`.

Thus, the final state adjustment is:
State: **`N` must be at least 2, `V` contains at least 2 elements, `diff` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `k + 1` elements and the sum of the remaining elements in `V`, if `M` is greater than `diff`, then `M` remains unchanged, otherwise, `M` is set to `diff`**.
