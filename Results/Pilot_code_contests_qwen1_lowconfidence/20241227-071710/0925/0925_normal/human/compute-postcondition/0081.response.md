Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`. `fl` is `True`. If `fl` is `False` and `mestot` is not less than `mestok`, `fl` remains `False`. The loop did not execute or all elements `l[i]` where `i` ranges from `mestok` to `len(l)` do not equal `'#'`. If any element `l[i]` equals `'#'`, `fl` is set to `False`.***
