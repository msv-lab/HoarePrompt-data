Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is the string input by the user, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None`), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None`). If the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is `True` if and only if no element `l[i]` (where `i` ranges from `mestok` to `len(l)`) equals `'#'`. Otherwise, `fl` is `False`. Depending on the value of `fl`, either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed to the console.***
