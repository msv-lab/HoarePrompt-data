The code assigns `None` to the variable `mestok`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `l`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, and `l` is the string input by the user; `mestok` is `None`**
