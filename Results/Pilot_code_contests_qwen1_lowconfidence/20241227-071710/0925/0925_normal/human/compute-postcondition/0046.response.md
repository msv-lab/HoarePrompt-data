Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`), `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`), and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` is `False` and `i` is the last valid index processed by the loop, or `fl` is `True` and the loop did not execute. Additionally, `fl` is not `False` and `mestot` is less than `mestok`.**
