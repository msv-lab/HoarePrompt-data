`mestok` is assigned the value of `i`. From the initial state, we know that `n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False` and `mestot` is less than `mestok`, and `l` is a non-empty list with the current value of `l[i]` being 'G'. After the code executes, the value of `mestok` changes to `i`, while all other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False` and `mestot` is less than `mestok`, and `l` is a non-empty list with the current value of `l[i]` being 'G', and `mestok` is equal to `i`.**
