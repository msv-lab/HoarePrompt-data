Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is equal to `i`, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False`, and `mestot` is less than `mestok`. Additionally, `l` is a non-empty list. If the condition `l[i] == 'T'` is true, then `l[i]` is set to 'T'. Otherwise, the variables and the list `l` remain unchanged.***
