Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is a string input by the user with the first character being 'T', `mestok` is either 2 (if `l[2] == 'G'`) or remains unchanged (if `l[2] != 'G'`), `mestot` is 2. If `mestok` and `mestot` are not None, the condition does not change the values of the variables.***
