`mestok` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is the string input by the user, `mestok` is 0, and the current value of `l[i]` is 'G'.
