The code `fl = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `fl`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `mestok`, `mestot`). Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is the string input by the user, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None`), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None`), `fl` is `True`.**
