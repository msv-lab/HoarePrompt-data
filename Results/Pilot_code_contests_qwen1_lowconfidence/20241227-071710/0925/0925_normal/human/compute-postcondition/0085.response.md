Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`. `fl` is `True` if and only if no element `l[i]` (where `i` ranges from `mestok` to `len(l)`) equals `'#'`. If any such element equals `'#'`, `fl` is set to `False`. Depending on the value of `fl`, either 'YES' is printed to the console or 'NO' is printed.***
