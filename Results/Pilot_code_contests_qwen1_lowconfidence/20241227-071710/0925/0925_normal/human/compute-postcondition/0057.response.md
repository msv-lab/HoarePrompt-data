Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is equal to `i`, `mestot` is equal to `i + 1`, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False`, and `mestot` is less than `mestok`. Additionally, `l` is a non-empty list. If `l[i]` is equal to 'G', the program does not change these states. Otherwise, the program also does not change these states.***
