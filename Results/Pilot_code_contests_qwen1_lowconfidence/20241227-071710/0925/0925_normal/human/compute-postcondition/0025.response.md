The code assigns the value of `i` to `mestot`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 3. Therefore, `mestot` will be updated to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is a string input by the user with the first character being 'T', `mestok` is 3, `mestot` is 3.**
