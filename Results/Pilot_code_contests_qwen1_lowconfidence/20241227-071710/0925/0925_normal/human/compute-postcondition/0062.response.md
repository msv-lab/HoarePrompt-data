Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is equal to `i + 1`, `mestot` is equal to `i + 1`, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False`, and `mestot` is not less than `mestok`. This is true whether `l[i]` is 'G' or not, as the else part does not change these conditions.***
