According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `l`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the bounds of the list `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0,
- `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`),
- `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`),
- The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`,
- `fl` remains `False`.

The loop starts from `mestok` and increments `i` by `k` each time. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the bounds of the list `l`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. Since the loop increments `i` by `k` each time, the next value of `i` would be `i_current + k`.

For the loop to continue:
- `i_current + k` must be less than or equal to the length of the list `l`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`),
- `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`),
- The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`,
- `fl` remains `False`,
- `i` (which was `mestok` initially) plus `k` is within the bounds of the list `l`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`), `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`), and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` remains `False`, `i` (the current value of `i` in the next iteration) must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k`**.
