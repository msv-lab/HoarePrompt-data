Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mestok` is a valid index.
- `mestot` is equal to `i`.
- The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`.
- `fl` is not `False`.
- `mestot` is less than `mestok`.
- `l` is a non-empty list.
- If the condition `l[i] == 'T'` is true, then `l[i]` is set to 'T'. Otherwise, the variables and the list `l` remain unchanged.

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in range(len(l)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range of `len(l)`.

2. **Variables and Their States**:
   - `mestok` remains a valid index.
   - `mestot` is equal to `i`.
   - `mestot` is less than `mestok`.
   - `l` is a non-empty list.
   - `fl` is not `False`.
   - The value of `l[i]` might have been updated if it was `'T'`.

3. **Loop Body Effects**:
   - If `l[i] == 'T'` is true, then `l[i]` is set to 'T'.
   - Otherwise, the variables and the list `l` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will increment by 1.
   - `mestot` will become `mestot + 1`.
   - `mestot` will still be less than `mestok` since both will increment by 1.
   - `l` will remain unchanged unless `l[i] == 'T'` was true, but this does not affect the loop condition or the other variables.
   - `fl` will remain not `False`.
   - `mestok` remains a valid index.

5. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(l)`.
   - Since `mestot` is less than `mestok` and both increment by 1 each iteration, `mestot` will eventually become equal to `mestok` and then exceed it, breaking the loop.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`:

- `mestot` will be `mestot + 1`.
- `l` remains unchanged unless `l[i]` was updated.
- All other conditions remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is equal to `i + 1`, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False`, and `mestot` is less than `mestok`. Additionally, `l` is a non-empty list.**
