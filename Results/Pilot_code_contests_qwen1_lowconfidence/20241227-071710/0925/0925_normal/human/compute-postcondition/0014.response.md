Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is the string input by the user with the first character being 'T', `mestok` is not None, `mestot` is not None. If `mestok` is not None and `mestot` is not None, the state remains unchanged.***
