Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is greater than 0
- `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`)
- `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`)
- The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`
- `fl` remains `False`
- `i` (the current value of `i` in the next iteration) must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k`

### For Loop Statement
```
for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop starts at `mestok` and increments by `k` until it reaches an index that is out of bounds for the list `l`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the bounds of the list `l`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k` before the next iteration.
- After the last iteration, `i` was increased by `k` and now needs to be checked against the condition for the next iteration.

### Adjusting the States
- Since `i` was incremented by `k` in the last iteration, the new value of `i` (in the next iteration) will be `i + k`.
- We need to ensure that `i + k` is still within the bounds of the list `l`.

Given that `i` must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k` before the next iteration, we need to check the following:

- `i + k` should be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k`.

### New State
- `n` is greater than 0
- `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`)
- `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`)
- The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`
- `fl` remains `False`
- `i` (the current value of `i` in the next iteration) must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k`

Since `i` was incremented by `k` in the last iteration, the new value of `i` (in the next iteration) should be:

\[ \text{new } i = \text{previous } i + k \]

And this new value of `i` must still be within the bounds of the list `l`.

### Final State
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`), `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`), and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` remains `False`, `i` (the current value of `i` in the next iteration) must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k` and `i` (in the current iteration) is `previous i + k`**
