The `break` statement does not modify the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most nested loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`), `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`), and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` is `False`, `i` (the current value of `i` in the next iteration) must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k` and `i` (in the current iteration) is `previous i + k`.**
