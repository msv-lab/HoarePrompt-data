Postcondition: ***`fl` remains `False`, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `mestot` is not less than `mestok`, `l` is a reversed list, `k` is a negative integer, and `i` is decremented by `k` and still within the range `[mestok, len(l))`, `l[i]` does not equal `'#'`. If `l[i]` equals `'#'`, the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop continues.***
