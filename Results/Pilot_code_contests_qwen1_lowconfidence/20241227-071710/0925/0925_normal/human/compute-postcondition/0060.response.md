Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `mestok` is equal to `i`.
   - `mestot` is equal to `i`.
   - The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`.
   - `fl` is not `False`.
   - `mestot` is not less than `mestok`.
   - `l` is a non-empty list.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(l) - 1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `l[i]` is equal to 'T', then `mestot` remains equal to `i`.
   - Otherwise, the states do not change.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to check the condition for the next value of `i`.

5. **Next Value of `i`**:
   - The current value of `i` is `i`.
   - The next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

6. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(l)`.
   - Since `l` is a non-empty list, `len(l)` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `len(l)`.

7. **States After One More Iteration**:
   - If `i` is the current value, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The conditions `mestok` and `mestot` will depend on the value of `l[i+1]`:
     - If `l[i+1]` is 'T', then `mestot` remains `i + 1`.
     - Otherwise, the states do not change.

8. **Final States**:
   - `n` is still greater than 0.
   - `mestok` is now equal to `i + 1` (if `l[i+1]` is 'T').
   - `mestot` is now equal to `i + 1` (if `l[i+1]` is 'T').
   - The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is still divisible by `k` (since they are the same).
   - `fl` is still not `False`.
   - `mestot` is still not less than `mestok` (since they are the same).

Given that `l` is non-empty and the loop will execute if `i < len(l)`, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is equal to `i + 1`, `mestot` is equal to `i + 1`, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False`, and `mestot` is not less than `mestok`.
