To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop terminates and the effect of the loop on the variables.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each character in the string `l` until both `mestok` and `mestot` are not `None`. This means the loop stops as soon as both `mestok` and `mestot` are set to a valid index in the string `l`.

2. **Effect on Variables**:
   - `mestok` is set to the index of the first 'G' encountered.
   - `mestot` is set to the index of the first 'T' encountered.
   - Once both `mestok` and `mestot` are set, the loop breaks.

3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If neither 'G' nor 'T' appears in the string `l`, `mestok` and `mestot` will remain `None`.
   - If 'G' and 'T' both appear in the string `l`, the loop will break as soon as both indices are found.

4. **Final Values**:
   - If 'G' and 'T' both appear in the string `l`, `mestok` and `mestot` will be set to the smallest indices where 'G' and 'T' are found respectively.
   - If 'G' or 'T' does not appear, `mestok` or `mestot` will remain `None`.

### Final Output State

- `n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `k` is the second element of the list `l1`.
- `l` is the string input by the user.
- `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' encountered in the string `l` (or `None` if no 'G' is found).
- `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' encountered in the string `l` (or `None` if no 'T' is found).

Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is the string input by the user, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None`), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None`).**
