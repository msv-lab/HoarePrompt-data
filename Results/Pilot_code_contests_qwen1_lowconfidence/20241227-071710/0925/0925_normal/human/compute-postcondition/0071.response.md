According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `mestok`, `len(l)`, and `k`. Specifically, the loop will continue as long as `mestok` plus `i` (which increments by `k` each iteration) does not exceed the length of the list `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `mestok` is a valid index
- `mestot` is a valid index
- The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`
- `fl` is `False`
- `mestot` is not less than `mestok`
- `l` is a reversed list
- `k` is a negative integer
- `mestok` is less than `len(l)`
- `mestok + n*k` is greater than or equal to `len(l)`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must hold true:
- `i` (which starts from `mestok` and increments by `k`) must still be within the bounds of the list `l`.
- Since `k` is negative, `i` will decrement with each iteration.

Let's determine the new state:
1. The initial value of `i` is `mestok`.
2. After one iteration, `i` becomes `mestok + k`.
3. For the loop to execute again, `mestok + k` must still be a valid index within the list `l`.

Given that `k` is negative, the condition for the next iteration is:
\[ mestok + k < len(l) \]

Since `k` is negative, `mestok + k` will be less than `mestok`, and it needs to stay within the bounds of the list. Therefore, the next valid `i` should be `mestok + k`.

So, the updated states are:
- `mestok` remains the same as it was incremented by `k` to become `i`.
- `mestot` remains unchanged.
- `fl` remains `False`.
- `l` remains a reversed list.
- `k` remains a negative integer.
- `mestok + k` must be less than `len(l)` to ensure the loop continues.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is `False`, `mestot` is not less than `mestok`, `l` is a reversed list, `k` is a negative integer, `mestok + k` is less than `len(l)`**
