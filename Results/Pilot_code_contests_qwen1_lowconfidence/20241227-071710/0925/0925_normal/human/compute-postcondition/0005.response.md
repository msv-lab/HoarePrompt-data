Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range of the length of the string `l`. This means that the loop depends on the value of `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - `n` is the length of the string `l`.
   - `k` is the second element of the list `l1`.
   - `l` is a string input by the user.
   - `mestok` is `None`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` (the loop variable) is less than `len(l)`. Therefore, `len(l)` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `n` is the length of `l`, so `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to start.
   - `i` starts at 0, so it needs to be set to 0 for the loop to begin.
   - `k` and `l` do not directly affect the loop condition but should be included in the state as they are given.
   - `mestok` is `None`, which is fine as it doesn't impact the loop execution.

5. **Final State Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is the length of the string `l`, and it must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is the second element of the list `l1`.
   - `l` is the string input by the user.
   - `mestok` is `None`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is the string input by the user, `mestok` is `None`**.
