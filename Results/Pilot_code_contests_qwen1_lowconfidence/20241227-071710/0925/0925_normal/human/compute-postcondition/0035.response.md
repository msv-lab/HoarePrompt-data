The code `break` is used to exit the nearest enclosing loop. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement directly affecting the variables within the given code snippet, the variables remain in their initial states except that the execution exits the loop or condition. The values of the variables `n`, `mestok`, `mestot`, and `fl` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`), `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`), and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` is `False`.**
