The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional statement. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional statement it is inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`), `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`), and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` is `False`, `i` (the current value of `i` in the next iteration) must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k`**
