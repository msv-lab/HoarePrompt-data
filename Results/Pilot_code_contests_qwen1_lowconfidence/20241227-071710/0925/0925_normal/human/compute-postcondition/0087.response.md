The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console but does not affect any of the variables' values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is the string input by the user, `mestok` is the index of the first 'G' in `l` (or `None`), `mestot` is the index of the first 'T' in `l` (or `None`), `fl` is `False`. The string 'NO' is printed to the console.**
