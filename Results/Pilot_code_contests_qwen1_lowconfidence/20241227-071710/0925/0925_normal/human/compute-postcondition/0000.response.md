The code `l1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes the input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `l1`. The initial values of `n` and `k` are provided as part of the input, and the string is also given. After executing this line of code, the following changes occur:

- The string and the initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- The list `l1` is created and contains two integers, which are the values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: the input consists of two integers `n` and `k` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' indicating empty cells, obstacles, the grasshopper's starting position, and the insect's position, respectively. It is guaranteed that 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string; `l1` is a list containing two integers (the values of `n` and `k`).
