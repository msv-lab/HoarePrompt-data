Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False`, and `mestot` is less than `mestok`. Additionally, `l` is a non-empty list where the current value of `l[i]` is 'G' if the condition `l[i] == 'G'` is true, and `mestok` is equal to `i` if the condition is met. If the condition `l[i] == 'G'` is false, the variables remain unchanged.***
