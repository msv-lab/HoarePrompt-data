Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mestok` is a valid index.
- `mestot` is a valid index.
- The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`.
- `fl` is not `False`.
- `mestot` is not less than `mestok`.
- `l` is a reversed list.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < len(l)`. Since `i` starts from `mestok` and increments by `k` each time, we need to ensure that there are enough elements in `l` to satisfy this condition.

2. **Valid Index**: We need to ensure that `mestok` is a valid index for the initial value of `i`. This means `mestok` should be within the bounds of the list `l`.

3. **Step Size**: The step size `k` must be positive (or negative if `l` is reversed). Given that `l` is a reversed list, `k` must be a negative integer to ensure the loop progresses correctly through the list.

4. **Range Calculation**: The loop will continue until `i` reaches or exceeds `len(l)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the final value of `i` (which is `mestok + n*k`) is still within the bounds of `l`.

### Adjusted States:
- `mestok` must be a valid starting index for the range, i.e., `mestok` should be less than `len(l)`.
- Since `l` is a reversed list, `k` must be a negative integer. Let's assume `k` is -1 for simplicity, but generally, it should be `-k` where `k` is a positive integer.
- The loop will increment by `-k`, so we need to ensure that the loop can run `n` times without going out of bounds. This means `mestok + n*k` should be greater than or equal to `len(l)` when considering the reversed nature of the list.

### Final State:
- `mestok` is a valid index.
- `mestot` is a valid index.
- The absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`.
- `fl` is not `False`.
- `mestot` is not less than `mestok`.
- `l` is a reversed list.
- `k` is a negative integer.
- `mestok` is less than `len(l)`.
- `mestok + n*k` is greater than or equal to `len(l)`.

### State:
**`mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False`, `mestot` is not less than `mestok`, `l` is a reversed list, `k` is a negative integer, `mestok` is less than `len(l)`, and `mestok + n*k` is greater than or equal to `len(l)`**.
