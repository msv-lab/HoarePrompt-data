`fl` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `fl` is now explicitly set to `False`, but the values of other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`), `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`), and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` is `False`, `i` (the current value of `i` in the next iteration) must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k`**
