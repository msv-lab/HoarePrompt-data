The code sets the boolean variable `fl` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `mestok`, `mestot`, or the elements of the list `l`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `fl`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`), `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`), and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` is `False`.**
