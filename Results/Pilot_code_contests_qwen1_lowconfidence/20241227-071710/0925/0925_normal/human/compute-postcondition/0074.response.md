Postcondition: ***`mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` remains `False`, `mestot` is not less than `mestok`, `l` is a reversed list, `k` is a negative integer, and if `l[i]` equals `'#'`, the loop or match-case statement breaks; otherwise, no change occurs.***
