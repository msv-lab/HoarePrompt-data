Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- \( n \) is greater than 0.
- \( \text{mestok} \) is a valid index (not `None`).
- \( \text{mestot} \) is a valid index (not `None`).
- The absolute difference between \( \text{mestot} \) and \( \text{mestok} \) is divisible by \( k \).
- \( \text{fl} \) is not `False`.
- \( \text{mestot} \) is less than \( \text{mestok} \).
- \( \text{l} \) is a reversed list.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    if l[i] == 'G':
        mestok = i
    if l[i] == 'T':
        mestot = i
```

### Analysis
1. **First Iteration:**
   - If \( l[0] == 'G' \), then \( \text{mestok} \) becomes 0.
   - If \( l[0] == 'T' \), then \( \text{mestot} \) becomes 0.
   - After the first iteration, \( \text{mestok} \) and \( \text{mestot} \) will both be 0.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - If \( l[1] == 'G' \), then \( \text{mestok} \) becomes 1.
   - If \( l[1] == 'T' \), then \( \text{mestot} \) becomes 1.
   - After the second iteration, \( \text{mestok} \) and \( \text{mestot} \) will both be 1.

3. **General Case:**
   - Each time \( l[i] \) matches either 'G' or 'T', the corresponding \( \text{mestok} \) or \( \text{mestot} \) is updated to \( i \).
   - Since \( \text{mestok} \) and \( \text{mestot} \) are both updated to the same index \( i \) when \( l[i] \) matches 'T', and \( \text{mestok} \) is only updated to \( i \) when \( l[i] \) matches 'G', the final values of \( \text{mestok} \) and \( \text{mestot} \) will be the same.

4. **Final Conditions:**
   - The loop will continue until \( i \) reaches the length of \( l \).
   - Since \( \text{mestot} \) is initially less than \( \text{mestok} \) and the loop updates \( \text{mestok} \) and \( \text{mestot} \) to the same value, \( \text{mestot} \) will never be less than \( \text{mestok} \) after the loop completes.
   - The absolute difference between \( \text{mestot} \) and \( \text{mestok} \) will still be divisible by \( k \).

### Final Output State
- \( n \) is greater than 0.
- \( \text{mestok} \) is a valid index (not `None`).
- \( \text{mestot} \) is a valid index (not `None`).
- The absolute difference between \( \text{mestot} \) and \( \text{mestok} \) is divisible by \( k \).
- \( \text{fl} \) is not `False`.
- \( \text{mestot} \) is not less than \( \text{mestok} \).
- \( \text{l} \) is a reversed list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False`, and `mestot` is not less than `mestok`. Additionally, `l` is a reversed list.**
