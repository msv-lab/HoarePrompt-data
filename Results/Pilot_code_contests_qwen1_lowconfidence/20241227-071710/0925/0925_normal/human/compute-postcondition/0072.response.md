The code `fl = False` simply reassigns the value of `fl` to `False`. Since this is the only line of code, no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is `False`, `mestot` is not less than `mestok`, `l` is a reversed list, `k` is a negative integer, `mestok + k` is less than `len(l)`**
