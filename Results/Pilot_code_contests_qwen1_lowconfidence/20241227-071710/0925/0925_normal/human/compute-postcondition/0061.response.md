The code `mestok = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mestok`. This changes the value of `mestok` from its previous value to the current value of `i`.

- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
- The value of `mestok` is updated to the current value of `i`.
- The value of `mestot` remains unchanged and is still equal to the previous value of `mestok` (which is now `i`).
- The condition that the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k` still holds true because they are now the same value.
- The value of `fl` remains unchanged and is still not `False`.
- The condition that `mestot` is not less than `mestok` still holds true because they are the same value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is equal to `i`, `mestot` is equal to `i`, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is not `False`, and `mestot` is not less than `mestok`.**
