Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is a string input by the user with the first character being 'T', `mestok` is 3, and `mestot` is 3. If `l[3] == 'T'`, `mestok` remains 3. Otherwise, `mestok` remains 3.***
