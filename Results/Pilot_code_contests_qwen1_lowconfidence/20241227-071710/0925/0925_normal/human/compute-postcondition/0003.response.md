The code assigns `None` to the variable `mestot`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `l`, `k` is the second element of `l1`, and `l` is the string input by the user; `mestot` is None**
