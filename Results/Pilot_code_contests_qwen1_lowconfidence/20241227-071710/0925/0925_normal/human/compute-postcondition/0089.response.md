The function `func` accepts a single parameter, which is a string of length `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'. Additionally, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. 

Based on the string and the values of `n` and `k`, the function returns a value indicating the outcome of some operation (not specified here).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string of length `n` and two integers `n` and `k`, and return a value based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string and two integers n and k, and returns a value based on the given conditions.**
