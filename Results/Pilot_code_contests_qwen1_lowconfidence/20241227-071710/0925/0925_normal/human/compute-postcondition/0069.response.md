The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or conditional statement we were inside. Since no loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code, the only impact is that we exit the context we were in, which in this case would be an implicit loop or condition.

Given the initial conditions and the fact that no variables are modified or used in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.

Output State: **`mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is `False`, `mestot` is not less than `mestok`, `l` is a reversed list, `k` is a negative integer, `mestok` is less than `len(l)`, and `mestok + n*k` is greater than or equal to `len(l)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
