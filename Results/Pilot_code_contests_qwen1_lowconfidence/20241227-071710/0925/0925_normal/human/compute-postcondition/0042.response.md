`fl` is assigned the value `False`. This sets `fl` to `False`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `mestok` is a valid index (not `None`), `mestot` is a valid index (not `None`), and the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` is `False`, `i` (the current value of `i` in the next iteration) must be less than or equal to the length of `l` minus `k` and `i` (in the current iteration) is `previous i + k`.
