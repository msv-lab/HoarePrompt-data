`mestok` is reassigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the other conditions and values of the variables are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `mestok` is equal to `i`; `mestot` is equal to `i + 1`; the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`; `fl` is not `False`; and `mestot` is less than `mestok`. Additionally, `l` is a non-empty list.
