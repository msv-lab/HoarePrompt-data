Postcondition: ***`mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `fl` is `False`, `mestot` is not less than `mestok`, `l` is a reversed list, `k` is a negative integer, `mestok` is less than `len(l)`, and `mestok + n*k` is greater than or equal to `len(l)`. If `l[i] == '#'`, the loop or if statement breaks.***
