The code assigns the value of `i` to `mestot`. Given that `i` is initially set to 1, `mestot` will be assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `l` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `k` is the second element of the list `l1`, `l` is the string input by the user, `mestok` is 0, `mestot` is 1. The first character of the string `l` is 'T'.**
