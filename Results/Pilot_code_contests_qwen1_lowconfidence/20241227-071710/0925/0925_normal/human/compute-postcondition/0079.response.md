Output State: **`fl` is `False`, `mestok` is a valid index, `mestot` is a valid index, the absolute difference between `mestot` and `mestok` is divisible by `k`, `mestot` is not less than `mestok`, `l` is a reversed list, `k` is a negative integer, and if any element `l[i]` where `i` ranges from `mestok` to `len(l)` (inclusive) equals `'#'`, `fl` is set to `False` and the loop breaks; otherwise, `fl` remains `False`.**
