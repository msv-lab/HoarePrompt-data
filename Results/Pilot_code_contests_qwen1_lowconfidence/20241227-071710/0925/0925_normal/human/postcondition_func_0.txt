The function accepts a string and two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It determines whether the grasshopper ('G') can jump from its initial position to the insect ('T')'s position without encountering any obstacles ('#'), where each jump is of size \( k \). If the grasshopper can reach the insect under these conditions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function checks the following:

1. The input string contains exactly one 'G' and one 'T'.
2. The absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by \( k \).
3. There are no obstacles ('#') between the grasshopper and the insect along the path defined by the jumps of size \( k \).

If the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is not divisible by \( k \), the function immediately prints 'NO'.

The function also handles the case where the string is reversed. If the indices of 'G' and 'T' are such that the absolute difference is divisible by \( k \) and there are no obstacles when the string is reversed, it still prints 'NO' unless the string was not reversed, in which case it prints 'YES'.
