Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks for the possibility of the grasshopper reaching the insect. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the grasshopper needs to reverse its direction after making the initial jump towards the insect. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
Input:
7 3
T..#..G
```

- The grasshopper starts at index 5 ('G') and the insect is at index 0 ('T').
- The grasshopper can jump 3 cells at a time.
- The first jump would take the grasshopper from index 5 to index 2, but there is an obstacle at index 2 ('#'), which prevents the grasshopper from continuing in the forward direction.

However, the program does not check if the grasshopper can reach the insect by reversing its direction after the first jump. Instead, it incorrectly prints "NO" because the obstacle is encountered during the forward jump.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Perform the initial jump to see if it encounters an obstacle.
2. If an obstacle is encountered, reverse the direction and check again.

Here is a modified version of the function that correctly handles this case:

```python
def func():
    l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (l1[0], l1[1])
    l = input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
    
    fl = True
    # Check in the forward direction
    for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
        if l[i] == '#':
            fl = False
            break
    
    if fl != False and mestot < mestok:
        # Reverse the direction and check again
        for i in range(mestok - 1, -1, -k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                fl = False
                break
    
    if fl == True:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

With this modification, the program correctly identifies whether the grasshopper can reach the insect by handling both forward and backward jumps.
