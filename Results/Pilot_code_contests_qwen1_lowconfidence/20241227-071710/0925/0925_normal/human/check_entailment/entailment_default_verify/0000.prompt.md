You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.

Output

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

5 2
#G#T#


Output

YES


Input

6 1
T....G


Output

YES


Input

7 3
T..#..G


Output

NO


Input

6 2
..GT..


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    l1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    (n, k) = (l1[0], l1[1])
    l = raw_input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
    fl = True
    if abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0:
        for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                fl = False
                break
        if fl != False and mestot < mestok:
            l = l[::-1]
            for i in range(len(l)):
                if l[i] == 'G':
                    mestok = i
                if l[i] == 'T':
                    mestot = i
            for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
                if l[i] == '#':
                    fl = False
                    break
        if fl == True:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in handling the case where the grasshopper needs to jump in the reverse direction. Specifically, the program reverses the string and checks for the path in reverse only if `mestot < mestok`. However, this approach does not correctly handle cases where the grasshopper needs to jump back towards the start of the line.

For example, consider the following input:
```
8 3
T..###G#
```

In this case:
- The grasshopper starts at index 2 (`G`).
- The target is at index 7 (`T`).
- The distance between them is 5, which is divisible by 3 (k).

The correct path would be:
- Jump from index 2 to index 5.
- Jump from index 5 to index 8.

However, the program will incorrectly conclude that no valid path exists because it only checks forward and then reverses the string without correctly re-evaluating the path.

To fix this, the program should check both forward and reverse directions without relying on string reversal, ensuring that all possible paths are evaluated.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string and two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It determines whether the grasshopper ('G') can jump from its initial position to the insect ('T')'s position without encountering any obstacles ('#'), where each jump is of size \( k \). If the grasshopper can reach the insect under these conditions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function checks the following:

1. The input string contains exactly one 'G' and one 'T'.
2. The absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by \( k \).
3. There are no obstacles ('#') between the grasshopper and the insect along the path defined by the jumps of size \( k \).

If the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is not divisible by \( k \), the function immediately prints 'NO'.

The function also handles the case where the string is reversed. If the indices of 'G' and 'T' are such that the absolute difference is divisible by \( k \) and there are no obstacles when the string is reversed, it still prints 'NO' unless the string was not reversed, in which case it prints 'YES'.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
