You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.

Output

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

5 2
#G#T#


Output

YES


Input

6 1
T....G


Output

YES


Input

7 3
T..#..G


Output

NO


Input

6 2
..GT..


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    l1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    (n, k) = (l1[0], l1[1])
    l = raw_input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
    fl = True
    if abs(mestot - mestok) % k == 0:
        for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                fl = False
                break
        if fl != False and mestot < mestok:
            l = l[::-1]
            for i in range(len(l)):
                if l[i] == 'G':
                    mestok = i
                if l[i] == 'T':
                    mestot = i
            for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
                if l[i] == '#':
                    fl = False
                    break
        if fl == True:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks for the possibility of the grasshopper reaching the insect. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the grasshopper needs to reverse its direction after making the initial jump towards the insect. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
Input:
7 3
T..#..G
```

- The grasshopper starts at index 5 ('G') and the insect is at index 0 ('T').
- The grasshopper can jump 3 cells at a time.
- The first jump would take the grasshopper from index 5 to index 2, but there is an obstacle at index 2 ('#'), which prevents the grasshopper from continuing in the forward direction.

However, the program does not check if the grasshopper can reach the insect by reversing its direction after the first jump. Instead, it incorrectly prints "NO" because the obstacle is encountered during the forward jump.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Perform the initial jump to see if it encounters an obstacle.
2. If an obstacle is encountered, reverse the direction and check again.

Here is a modified version of the function that correctly handles this case:

```python
def func():
    l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (l1[0], l1[1])
    l = input()
    mestot = None
    mestok = None
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == 'G':
            mestok = i
        if l[i] == 'T':
            mestot = i
        if mestok != None and mestot != None:
            break
    
    fl = True
    # Check in the forward direction
    for i in range(mestok, len(l), k):
        if l[i] == '#':
            fl = False
            break
    
    if fl != False and mestot < mestok:
        # Reverse the direction and check again
        for i in range(mestok - 1, -1, -k):
            if l[i] == '#':
                fl = False
                break
    
    if fl == True:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

With this modification, the program correctly identifies whether the grasshopper can reach the insect by handling both forward and backward jumps.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, and a string of length n containing characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T' indicating empty cells, obstacles, the grasshopper's starting position, and the insect's position, respectively. It is guaranteed that 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.
