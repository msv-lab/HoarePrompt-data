Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the grasshopper can jump from its initial position to the insect's position without encountering any obstacles, given the constraints of the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` and the string representing the board. This ensures that the program processes the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Identifying Starting and Target Positions**:
   - The program identifies the positions of 'G' (grasshopper) and 'T' (target) using a single pass through the string. This is done efficiently and correctly.

3. **Initial Validation**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is divisible by `k`. If this condition is not met, the program immediately prints 'NO', adhering to the problem description.

4. **Checking Valid Jumps**:
   - The program then performs two separate checks for valid jumps:
     - The first check considers the original order of the string.
     - The second check reverses the string and performs the check again.
   - In both cases, the program ensures that no obstacles ('#') are encountered during the jumps. If any obstacle is found, the program sets the flag `fl` to `False`.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - Based on the value of `fl`, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO'. This decision-making process correctly reflects the logic needed to determine if the grasshopper can reach the insect.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the string is reversed, ensuring that it checks both directions of possible jumps, which is necessary according to the problem description.

Given these points, the program accurately follows the problem description and handles all relevant scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
