`Ans` is assigned the value of `Ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`, and `Ans` is an empty string. Therefore, `Ans` will now contain the string representation of `a[n-1]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, `Ans` is the string representation of `a[n-1]`**
