The code snippet `b[T[i][1]] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the element in the list or array `b` at the index specified by `T[i][1]`. However, the initial state does not provide the definition of `b` or `T`, and since `i` is known to be `1`, we can infer that `T[1][1]` is used to index into `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 2 (though this information is not directly relevant to the assignment operation).
- `i` is 1.

The key information from the code is that `T[1][1]` is being used as the index to assign `1` to `b`. Since the exact structure of `T` is not given, we can only state that `b` at the index `T[1][1]` is now `1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `b` at index `T[1][1]` is 1**
