`a[T[i][1]]` is assigned the value 1. Given that `T[i][1]` refers to the second element of the sublist at index `i` in list `T`, and the last element of list `T` is 0, this operation does not directly affect the last element of `T`. The value of `n` and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `a[T[i][1]]` is 1, the last element of list `T` is 0.**
