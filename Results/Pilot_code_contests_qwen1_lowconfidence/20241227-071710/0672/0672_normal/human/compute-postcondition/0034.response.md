`b[i]` is assigned the value `1`. Since the initial state of `b` is a list of `n` zeros where `b[n//2-1]` is `1` and `b[n//2]` is `1`, the only way for `b[i]` to be assigned `1` is if `i` is equal to `n//2-1` or `n//2`. Therefore, the only change in the list `b` is that another `1` is added at index `i`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `A` is a list containing integers, `B` is a list containing integers, `T` is a list of tuples sorted based on the `value` within each tuple, `a` is a list of `n` zeros except for two `1`s at indices `n//2-1` and `n//2`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros where `b[n//2-1]` is `1`, `b[n//2]` is `1`, and `b[i]` is `1` where `i` is either `n//2-1` or `n//2`.**
