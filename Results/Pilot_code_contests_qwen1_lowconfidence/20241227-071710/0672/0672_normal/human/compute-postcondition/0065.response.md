The code `Ans += str(b[i])` updates the string stored in `Ans` by appending the string representation of `b[i]`. The initial state is that `n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n`, and `Ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` followed by a newline character. After executing the code, the value of `Ans` changes to include the string representation of `b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n`, `Ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` followed by a newline character, and then the string representation of `b[i]`.**
