`T` is a list of tuples that initially contains four elements. The code appends another tuple `(b, i, 1)` to this list. The values of `b_input`, `b`, `a_input`, `a`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The updated list `T` now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a_input, a, a]`; `B` is `[b_input, b, b]`; `T` is `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, n, 1), (a, n-1, 0), (a, i, 0), (b, i, 1)]`**
