`T` is a list of tuples, and one of its elements is `(b_input, i+1, 1)`. The code appends a new tuple `(b, i, 1)` to the list `T`. The variables `b_input`, `b`, `i`, `a_input`, `a`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the list `T` now includes both `(b_input, i+1, 1)` and `(b, i, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a_input, a]`; `B` is `[b_input, b]`; `T` is `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, i+1, 1), (a, i, 0), (b, i, 1)]`**
