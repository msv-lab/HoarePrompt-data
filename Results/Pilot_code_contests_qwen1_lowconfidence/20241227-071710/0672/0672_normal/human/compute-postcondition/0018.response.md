The code `A.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `A`. Initially, `A` is defined as `[a_input, a]`. After appending `a` to `A`, `A` becomes `[a_input, a, a]`.

The values of `n`, `B`, and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a_input, a, a]`; `B` is `[b_input, b]`; `T` is `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, n, 1), (a, n-1, 0), (b, n-1, 1)]`**
