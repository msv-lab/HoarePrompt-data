`Ans` is updated by appending the string representation of `b[i]` to itself. The value of `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is at least 2, so `i` is also a valid index for the list `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n`, `Ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` followed by a newline character, and `Ans` is updated by appending the string representation of `b[i]` to itself.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n`, `Ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` followed by a newline character, and `Ans` is updated by appending the string representation of `b[i]` to itself**
