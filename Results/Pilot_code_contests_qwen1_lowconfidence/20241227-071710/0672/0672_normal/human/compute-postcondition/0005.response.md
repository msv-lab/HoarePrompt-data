`a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())` reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since these integers are read from input, their specific values are not known in this context, but they are guaranteed to be integers. The lists `A`, `B`, and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `A` is an empty list, `B` is an empty list, `T` is an empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
