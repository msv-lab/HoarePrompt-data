`a[i]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `i` is a valid index for the list `a`, which initially contains `n` zeros. Therefore, the value at index `i` in list `a` is updated to `1`, while the other elements remain `0`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `A` is a list containing integers, `B` is a list containing integers, `T` is a list of tuples sorted based on the `value` within each tuple, `index` and `flag` values within each tuple remain unchanged, `a` is a list of `n` zeros except for `a[i]` which is `1`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros**
