`sys.stdout.write(Ans)` writes the content of the variable `Ans` to the standard output. This does not change the value of `Ans` or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is that the content of `Ans` is printed to the standard output. The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, and `Ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `Ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` followed by a newline character, and then the string representation of each element in the list `b`, and the content of `Ans` is printed to the standard output.**
