Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `Ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` followed by a newline character, and then the string representation of each element in the list `b`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `Ans` starts as the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` followed by a newline character.
- During each iteration, `Ans` is updated by appending the string representation of `b[i]` to itself.
- Since the loop runs `n` times (from `0` to `n-1`), `Ans` will include the string representation of each element in `b` concatenated to the existing `Ans`.

Therefore, after the loop completes, `Ans` will contain the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `a` followed by a newline character, and then the string representation of each element in `b`.
