Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is a list containing integers where each element corresponds to an input `a` in the order they were read; `B` is a list containing integers where each element corresponds to an input `b` in the order they were read; `T` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is in the form `(value, index, flag)`, with `value` being either an element from `A` or `B`, `index` being the index of the element in the original input, and `flag` indicating whether the value comes from `A` (flag = 0) or `B` (flag = 1).**
