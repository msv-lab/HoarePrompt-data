The code assigns the value `1` to `b[T[i][1]]`. The value of `T[i][-1]` is not affected and remains non-zero. The values of `n` and `i` are not directly used in the assignment, but the condition that `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 0 still holds. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `b[T[i][1]]` is 1, `T[i][-1]` is not 0**
