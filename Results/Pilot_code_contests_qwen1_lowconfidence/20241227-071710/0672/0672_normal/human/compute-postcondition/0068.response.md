The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to process some internal data or logic based on predefined constraints where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and the results `ai` and `bi` are sorted in ascending order for each semifinal, with all results being distinct positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\).
