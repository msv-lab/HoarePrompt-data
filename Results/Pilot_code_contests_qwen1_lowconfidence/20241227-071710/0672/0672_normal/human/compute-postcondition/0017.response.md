The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial values of `a_input` and `b_input` are replaced by these inputs. The values of `n`, `A`, `B`, and `T` remain unchanged. 

Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. `a_input` and `b_input` are read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and split into two integers, which are then assigned to `a` and `b`.
2. The values of `n`, `A`, `B`, and `T` remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a_input, a]`; `B` is `[b_input, b]`; `T` is `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, n, 1), (a, n-1, 0), (b, n-1, 1)]`**
