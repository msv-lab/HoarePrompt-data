`a[T[i][1]]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `i` is 2, but since `T` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact index being accessed in `a`. However, the value of `a[T[2][1]]` is set to `1`. The state of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `a[T[2][1]]` is 1**
