The code snippet `B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. Given the initial state, `B` is `[b_input, b]`. Appending `b` to this list results in `B` becoming `[b_input, b, b]`.

The values of `n`, `A`, and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a_input, a, a]`; `B` is `[b_input, b, b]`; `T` is `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, n, 1), (a, n-1, 0), (b, n-1, 1)]`**
