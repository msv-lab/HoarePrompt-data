`Ans` is assigned the value of itself plus the string representation of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is at least 2, `i` is also at least 2. The initial state of `Ans` is the string representation of `a[n-1]`.

The code updates `Ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` (which is `a[n-1]` because `i` is `n`) to its current value. Therefore, `Ans` now includes both the string representation of `a[n-1]` and `a[n-1]` again.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `Ans` is the string representation of `a[n-1]` followed by the string representation of `a[n-1]`**
