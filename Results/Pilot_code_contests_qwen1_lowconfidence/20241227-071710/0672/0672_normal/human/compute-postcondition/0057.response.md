`Ans` is a string that is initially the string representation of `a[n-1]` followed by the string representation of `a[n-1]`. The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` to `Ans`, where `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `Ans` becomes the string representation of `a[n-1]` followed by the string representation of `a[n-1]`, followed by the string representation of `a[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `Ans` is the string representation of `a[n-1]` followed by the string representation of `a[n-1]` followed by the string representation of `a[n]`**
