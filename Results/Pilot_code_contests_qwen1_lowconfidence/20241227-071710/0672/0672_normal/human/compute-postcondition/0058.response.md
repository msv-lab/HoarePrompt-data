Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `Ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, and `Ans` is an empty string.
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
- During each iteration, the loop appends the string representation of `a[i]` to `Ans`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `Ans` will contain the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a`.

In the case where the loop does not execute (which would only happen if `n` is less than 2, but this contradicts the initial state condition), the values of the variables remain as follows:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `Ans` remains an empty string.

However, since the initial state specifies `n` is at least 2, the loop will always execute at least once, and the final state will be as described above.
