The code `T.append((a, i, 0))` appends a tuple `(a, i, 0)` to the list `T`. Initially, `T` contains `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, i+1, 1)]`. After appending `(a, i, 0)`, the list `T` will contain three elements: `(a_input, 0, 0)`, `(b_input, i+1, 1)`, and `(a, i, 0)`.

- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
- The value of `A` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
- The value of `B` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
- The value of `T` changes as it now contains the additional tuple `(a, i, 0)`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `A` is `[a_input, a]`
- `B` is `[b_input, b]`
- `T` is `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, i+1, 1), (a, i, 0)]`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a_input, a]`; `B` is `[b_input, b]`; `T` is `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, i+1, 1), (a, i, 0)]`**
