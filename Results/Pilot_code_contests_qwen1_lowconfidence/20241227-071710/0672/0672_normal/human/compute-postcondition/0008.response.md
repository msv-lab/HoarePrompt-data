`T.append((a, i, 0))` appends a tuple `(a, i, 0)` to the list `T`. Given the initial state, `a` is the first element in the list `A`, which is `[a]`, so `a` is the only element in `A`. The variable `i` is not explicitly defined, but it should be the index of `a` in `A`, which is `0` since `A` contains only one element. The third element in the tuple is `0`.

Therefore, after appending this tuple to `T`, `T` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(a, 0, 0)`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `A`, `B`, and `b`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b]`; `T` is a list containing `[(a, 0, 0)]`; `b` is an input integer**
