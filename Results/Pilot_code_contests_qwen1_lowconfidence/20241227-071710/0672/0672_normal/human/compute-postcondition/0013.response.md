`B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. In the initial state, `B` is `[b_input]`. After appending `b`, the list `B` will contain both `b_input` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a_input, a]`; `B` is `[b_input, b]`; `T` is a list containing `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, i+1, 1)]`**
