The code `T.append((b, i, 1))` appends a tuple `(b, i, 1)` to the list `T`. From the initial state, `i` is not explicitly defined, but in the context of appending to `T`, it should be assumed to be the current index or a relevant value when this line of code is executed. Since `i` is not defined before the append operation, it could be the length of `T` before the append operation.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `A` is `[a]`
- `B` is a list containing `[b]`
- `T` is a list containing `[(a, 0, 0)]`
- `b` is an input integer

After executing the code `T.append((b, i, 1))`:
- The list `T` will now contain `[(a, 0, 0)]` and `(b, i, 1)`.
- The values of `n`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b]`; `T` is a list containing `[(a, 0, 0), (b, i, 1)]`**
