Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `Ans` is the string representation of `a[n-1]` followed by the string representation of `a[n-1]`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.
   - This means `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, it does not satisfy the condition `0 <= i < n` (the condition for the loop to continue).
   - Therefore, the loop has already completed its iterations and is not expected to execute again based on the given initial states.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - There is no need to adjust any states since the loop has already finished its execution.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n`, `Ans` is the string representation of `a[n-1]` followed by the string representation of `a[n-1]`**

Since the loop has completed, no changes are required to the states provided.
