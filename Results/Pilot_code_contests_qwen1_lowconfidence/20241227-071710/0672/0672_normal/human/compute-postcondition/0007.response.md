`B.append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `B`. The initial state is that `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^5\), `A` is `[a]`, `B` is an empty list, `T` is an empty list, and `b` is an input integer. After executing the code, `B` will contain the value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `A` is `[a]`, `B` is a list containing `[b]`, `T` is an empty list, `b` is an input integer**
