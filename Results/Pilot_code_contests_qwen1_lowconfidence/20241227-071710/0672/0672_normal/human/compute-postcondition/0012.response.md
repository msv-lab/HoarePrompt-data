`A.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `A`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `a`, it will be appended as is. The other variables (`n`, `B`, and `T`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a_input, a]`; `B` is `[b_input]`; `T` is a list containing `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, i+1, 1)]`**
