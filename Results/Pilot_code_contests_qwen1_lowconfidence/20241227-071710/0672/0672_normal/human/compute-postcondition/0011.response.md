The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b]`; and `T` is a list containing `[(a, 0, 0), (b, i+1, 1)]`. After reading the input, the values of `A` and `B` will change to reflect the new values of `a` and `b`.

Let's denote the values of `a` and `b` read from the input as `a_input` and `b_input`. Therefore, `A` will be `[a_input]` and `B` will be `[b_input]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a_input]`; `B` is `[b_input]`; `T` is a list containing `[(a_input, 0, 0), (b_input, i+1, 1)]**.
