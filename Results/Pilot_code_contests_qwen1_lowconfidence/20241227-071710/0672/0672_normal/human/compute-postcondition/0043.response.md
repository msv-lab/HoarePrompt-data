In the given code snippet, `a[T[i][1]] = 1`, the value of `a[T[i][1]]` is assigned to be `1`. However, the variables `a` and `T` are not defined in the initial state, nor are their structures specified. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact state of `a` after this line of code is executed. The only thing we know for certain is that the element in array `a` at the index specified by `T[i][1]` is now `1`.

Given that `i` is `1` in the initial state, `i` does not change, but we cannot determine `T[i][1]` without more information.

Since the exact state of `a` cannot be determined without additional context, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a[T[1][1]]` is 1**
