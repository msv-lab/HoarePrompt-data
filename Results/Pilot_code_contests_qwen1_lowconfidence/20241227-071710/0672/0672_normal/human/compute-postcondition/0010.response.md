Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `A` is `[a]`.
   - `B` is a list containing `[b]`.
   - `T` is a list containing `[(a, 0, 0), (b, i, 1)]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is \(k\) where \(0 \leq k < n-1\).

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be \(k+1\).
   - Since the loop condition is `i in range(n)`, for the loop to continue, \(k+1\) must still be within the range \(0 \leq i < n\). This means \(n > k+1\), but since \(i\) was \(k\) at the end of the previous iteration, \(k+1 < n\) must hold true for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjusted States:**
   - `A` remains unchanged: `[a]`.
   - `B` remains unchanged: `[b]`.
   - `T` remains unchanged: `[(a, 0, 0), (b, i, 1)]`. After the loop increment, `i` becomes \(k+1\), so the state of `T` becomes `[(a, 0, 0), (b, k+1, 1)]`.

7. **Final State:**
   - `n` remains the same: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `i` is now \(k+1\).
   - `T` is updated to `[(a, 0, 0), (b, k+1, 1)]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `A` is `[a]`; `B` is a list containing `[b]`; `T` is a list containing `[(a, 0, 0), (b, i+1, 1)]**.
