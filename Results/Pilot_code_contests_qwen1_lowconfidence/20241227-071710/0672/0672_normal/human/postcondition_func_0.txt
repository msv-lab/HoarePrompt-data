The function processes input data consisting of \(n\) pairs of integers \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). It sorts these values into two lists, \(A\) and \(B\), and creates a list \(T\) containing tuples representing each value along with its index and origin (either from \(A\) or \(B\)). After sorting \(T\), it initializes two lists, \(a\) and \(b\), both filled with zeros. For the first half of the sorted values in \(T\), it sets the corresponding indices in \(a\) and \(b\) to 1. Finally, it constructs a string `Ans` by concatenating the binary representations of the lists \(a\) and \(b\) separated by a newline character and outputs this string.
