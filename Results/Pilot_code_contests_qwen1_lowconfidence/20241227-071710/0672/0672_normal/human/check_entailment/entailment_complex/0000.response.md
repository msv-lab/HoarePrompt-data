Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of participants `n` from the standard input.
   - It then reads `n` pairs of integers, one pair per line, representing the results of each participant in the two semifinals.
   - The inputs are validated to ensure `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and each value is between `1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Data Structure Initialization**:
   - Two lists `A` and `B` are initialized to store the results of the participants from the two semifinals.
   - A list `T` is created to store tuples of the form `(value, index, flag)`, where `value` is either from `A` or `B`, `index` is the original index of the value, and `flag` indicates the origin (`0` for `A`, `1` for `B`).

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `T` is sorted based on the values. This ensures that the participants are ordered by their performance in the semifinals.

4. **Determining Finalists**:
   - The program initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of which participants from each semifinal have a chance to advance to the finals.
   - The first half of the sorted values (up to `n // 2`) are marked as having a chance to advance by setting `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `1`.

5. **Constructing Output**:
   - The program constructs a string `Ans` by concatenating the binary representations of the lists `a` and `b`, separated by a newline character.
   - This output format matches the required format specified in the problem statement.

Given the above steps, the program correctly identifies the participants who have a chance to advance to the finals based on the rules provided. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
