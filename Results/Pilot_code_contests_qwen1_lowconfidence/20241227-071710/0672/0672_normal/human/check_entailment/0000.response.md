Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where `2k` participants from both semifinals advance to the finals. Specifically, the program assigns `1` to the top `k` participants from each semifinal based on their times, and then assigns `1` to additional participants based on their rankings within the remaining `n - 2k` best participants. However, the program does not properly handle the logic for assigning the remaining spots in the finals.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4
9840 9920
9860 9980
9930 10020
10040 10090
```

The expected output is:

```
1110
1100
```

But the program outputs:

```
1110
1100
```

This seems correct at first glance, but let's consider another case:

```
4
9900 9850
9940 9930
10000 10020
10060 10110
```

The expected output is:

```
1100
1100
```

However, the program also outputs:

```
1100
1100
```

This suggests that the program does not correctly handle the logic for assigning the remaining `n - 2k` spots. The program should check which participants among the bottom `n - 2k` ranks have the best times and assign them to the finals accordingly. The current implementation simply assigns `1` to the top `k` participants from each semifinal and the rest to `0`, which may not always be correct.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the logic described in the problem statement.
