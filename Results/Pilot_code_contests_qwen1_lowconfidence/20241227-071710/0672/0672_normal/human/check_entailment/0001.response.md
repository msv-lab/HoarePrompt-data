Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `2k < n` and there are participants left who did not qualify for the finals according to the rules. Specifically, the program always sets the first `n//2` participants from each semifinal as qualifiers without considering the top `k` performers from each semifinal and the next best `n-2k` participants.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
5
9800 9900
9950 10000
10050 10100
10150 10200
10250 10300
```

According to the problem description, if `k=2`, the top 2 performers from each semifinal will qualify directly, and the next best 1 participant from each semifinal will also qualify. This means the qualifiers should be:
- From the first semifinal: 9800, 9950, 10050
- From the second semifinal: 9900, 10000, 10100

However, the current implementation would set the first 2.5 (rounded down to 2) participants from each semifinal as qualifiers, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Identify the top `k` performers from each semifinal.
2. Select the next best `n-2k` performers from the remaining participants.

This requires a more detailed logic to handle the selection process based on the value of `k`.
