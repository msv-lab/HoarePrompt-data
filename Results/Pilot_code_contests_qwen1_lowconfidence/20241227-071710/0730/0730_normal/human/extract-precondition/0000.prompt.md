You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are N people standing in a queue from west to east.

Given is a string S of length N representing the directions of the people. The i-th person from the west is facing west if the i-th character of S is `L`, and east if that character of S is `R`.

A person is happy if the person in front of him/her is facing the same direction. If no person is standing in front of a person, however, he/she is not happy.

You can perform the following operation any number of times between 0 and K (inclusive):

Operation: Choose integers l and r such that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq N, and rotate by 180 degrees the part of the queue: the l-th, (l+1)-th, ..., r-th persons. That is, for each i = 0, 1, ..., r-l, the (l + i)-th person from the west will stand the (r - i)-th from the west after the operation, facing east if he/she is facing west now, and vice versa.

What is the maximum possible number of happy people you can have?

Constraints

* N is an integer satisfying 1 \leq N \leq 10^5.
* K is an integer satisfying 1 \leq K \leq 10^5.
* |S| = N
* Each character of S is `L` or `R`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
S


Output

Print the maximum possible number of happy people after at most K operations.
