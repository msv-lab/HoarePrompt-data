Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string `S` contains multiple segments of alternating directions correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
N K
13 3
LRRLRLRRLRLLR
```

The expected output is 9, but the program might not produce this result because it does not properly account for multiple segments of alternating directions when calculating the maximum number of happy people. The current implementation only considers consecutive `LR` or `RL` pairs and does not fully account for the possibility of multiple such segments within the string. This leads to potential underestimation of the maximum number of happy people.
