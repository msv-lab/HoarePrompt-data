Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is `N`, `ans` is 2, and `i` is 2 (if `s[1]` is 'L' and `1 - 1` is valid and `s[0]` is 'L', otherwise `i` is 0). This holds true if and only if `s[i] == 'R'` and `i <= n - 2` and `s[i + 1] == 'R'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1 and `i` remains as initially defined (2 if `s[1]` is 'L' and `1 - 1` is valid and `s[0]` is 'L', otherwise `i` is 0`).***
