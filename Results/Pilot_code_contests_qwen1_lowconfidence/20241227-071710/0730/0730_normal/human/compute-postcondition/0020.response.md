Output State: **`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is `N`, `ans` is the count of consecutive 'LL' substrings and consecutive 'RR' substrings in `s`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- For each character, it checks if the character is 'L' followed by another 'L' or 'R' followed by another 'R'.
- Each time such a pair is found, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `ans` will contain the total count of all consecutive 'LL' and 'RR' substrings in the string `s`.

Thus, the final value of `ans` will be the total count of all such pairs in the string `s`, and `n` will still be the length of the string `s`.
