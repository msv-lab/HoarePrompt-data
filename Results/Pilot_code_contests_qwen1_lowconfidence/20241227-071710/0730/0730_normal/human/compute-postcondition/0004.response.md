`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` was initially 0, so now it is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length N consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is N, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length N consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is N, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**
