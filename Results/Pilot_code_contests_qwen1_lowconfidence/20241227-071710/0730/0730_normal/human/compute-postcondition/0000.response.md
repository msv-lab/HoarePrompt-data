The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of `s` is denoted as `N` in the initial state. After executing this line of code, the value of `s` remains unchanged, but the variable `n` now holds the length of `s`.

Output State: **s is a string of length N consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is N**
