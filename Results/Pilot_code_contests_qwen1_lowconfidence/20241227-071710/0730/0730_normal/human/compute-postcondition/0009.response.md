Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is `N`, `ans` is 1, and `i` is 1 if `s[i]` is 'L', `i - 1` is valid, and `s[i - 1]` is 'L'. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and either `i` is 0 or `s[i]` is not 'L' or `i` is less than 1 or `s[i-1]` is not 'L'. If `s[i]` is 'R', `i` is less than or equal to `n - 2`, and `s[i + 1]` is 'R', then `ans` remains 1.***
