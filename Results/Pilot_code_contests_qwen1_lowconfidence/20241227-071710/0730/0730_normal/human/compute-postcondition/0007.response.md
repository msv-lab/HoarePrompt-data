`ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `s[i]` is 'R', `i` is less than or equal to `n - 2`, and `s[i + 1]` is 'R'. The other conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is `N`, `ans` is 1 (since it was initially 0 and incremented by 1), `i` is 0, and either `i` is 0 or `s[i]` is not 'L' or `i` is less than 1 or `s[i-1]` is not 'L'. The current value of `s[i]` is 'R', `i` is less than or equal to `n - 2`, and `s[i + 1]` is 'R'.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is `N`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and either `i` is 0 or `s[i]` is not 'L' or `i` is less than 1 or `s[i-1]` is not 'L'; the current value of `s[i]` is 'R', `i` is less than or equal to `n - 2`, and `s[i + 1]` is 'R'**
