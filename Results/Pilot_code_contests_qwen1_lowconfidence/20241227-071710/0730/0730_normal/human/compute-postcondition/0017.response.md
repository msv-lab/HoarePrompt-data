`ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is either 1 or 2. Incrementing 1 gives 2, and incrementing 2 gives 3. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is `N`, `ans` is either 2 or 3, and `i` is 3.**
