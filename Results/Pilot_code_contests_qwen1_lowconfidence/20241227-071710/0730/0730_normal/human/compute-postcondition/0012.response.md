The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state where `ans` is 1, after executing this line, `ans` will be 2. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `N` consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is `N`, `ans` is 2, and `i` is 2 (if `s[1]` is 'L' and `1 - 1` is valid and `s[0]` is 'L', otherwise `i` is 0).**
