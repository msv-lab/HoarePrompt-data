The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R'. The length of the string `s` is `N`. It also accepts an integer `K`, which is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= K <= 10^5. The function returns `ans`, which is the count of consecutive 'LL' and 'RR' substrings in string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and an integer `K`, and return the count of consecutive 'LL' and 'RR' substrings in `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and an integer `K`, and returns the count of consecutive 'LL' and 'RR' substrings in `s`.**
