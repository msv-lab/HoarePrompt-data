State: **`s` is a string of length N consisting of 'L' and 'R', `n` is N, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs using `range(n)`, where `n` is equal to the length of the string `s`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n` when the loop starts.
3. Initially, `i` should be set to 0 because `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.
4. The variables `s`, `n`, and `ans` do not need to be adjusted as they are correctly initialized according to the given state.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is setting `i` to 0 to ensure the loop can start executing.
