The given code initializes an empty list named `ans`. This does not change the values of `N`, `M`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `c_i`, or their relationships. The output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the addition of the initialized list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `M` is an integer such that N-1 ≤ M ≤ min(N(N-1)/2, 1000), and for each i (1 ≤ i ≤ M), `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ N and a_i ≠ b_i, `c_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 1000; `ans` is an empty list**
