k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each of the following k pairs of lines contains: (1) an integer n_i (1 ≤ n_i < 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the i-th sequence, and (2) a line with n_i integers a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, ..., a_{i, n_i} representing the elements of the i-th sequence. The elements of the sequences are integer numbers from -10^4 to 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all given sequences does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, i.e., n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
