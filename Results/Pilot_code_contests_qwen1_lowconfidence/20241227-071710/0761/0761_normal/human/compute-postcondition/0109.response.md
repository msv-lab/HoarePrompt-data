Postcondition: ***`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`. The console outputs 'YES' and prints `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)` before exiting, if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`. Otherwise, the program continues without any specific changes to the variables.***
