The code snippet prints the values of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`. According to the initial state, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is not specified directly, but `tk[i - s][0][0]` is `k + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`. Since `tk[i - s][1]` is a separate element in the list, its values are not directly given, but they remain unchanged unless explicitly modified. The print statement does not modify any variables; it only outputs their values.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list with more than one element including `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and the console prints 'YES'; `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` is `k + 1`, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`; `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` are printed.**
