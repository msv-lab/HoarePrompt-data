The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`. The value of `flag` remains 0. Printed: NO**
