To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and requirements:

1. **Variable Analysis**:
   - `l` is currently 0.
   - `k` is greater than itself (which means `k` is greater than 0).
   - `ni` is an input integer (this value is not directly relevant to the loop condition but might be used elsewhere in the program).
   - `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user (we need to ensure this list has at least one element for the loop to execute).
   - `jam` is a list containing the list `arr` (this is derived from `arr` and doesn't affect the loop condition directly).
   - `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr` (this is derived from `arr` and doesn't affect the loop condition directly).
   - `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr` (this is derived from `arr` and the elements of `arr`).

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `sk` (list of unique integers from `arr`).
   - For the loop to execute, `sk` must contain at least one element.

3. **Deriving Necessary States**:
   - Since `sk` is derived from `arr`, we need to ensure `arr` has at least one unique element to populate `sk`.
   - Therefore, `arr` must have at least one unique integer.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop can execute are:

- `arr` must have at least one unique integer.
- `sk` must have at least one element, which means `arr` must have at least one unique integer.

Given these conditions, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:

State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element**
