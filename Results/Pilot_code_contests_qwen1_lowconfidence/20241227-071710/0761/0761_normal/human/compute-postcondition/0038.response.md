Postcondition: ***`tk[i - s]` now contains an additional tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, and either the print statement has been executed (outputting the values of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`) and the program has terminated, or there is no additional change since there is no else part in the code.***
