Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `k` iterations, where `k` is the number of inputs provided by the user.
- For each iteration `l` (from 0 to `k-1`), the following operations are performed:
  1. An integer `ni` is read from input.
  2. A list of integers `arr` is read from input.
  3. `jam` is updated to include the list `arr`.
  4. The sum `s` of the elements in `arr` is calculated.
  5. A list `sk` of unique elements from `arr` is created.
  6. For each unique element `i` in `sk`, a key `i - s` is added to the dictionary `tk` (if it does not already exist), and a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` is appended to the list associated with this key.
  7. If there are more than one such tuples in `tk[i - s]`, it checks if the corresponding lists in `jam` at these indices are different. If so, it prints the indices and exits the program.

After all iterations, the final state will have:
- `k` as the integer input from the user.
- `tk` as a dictionary with keys derived from the differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values as lists of tuples indicating the indices and positions of those elements in `arr`.
- `jam` as a list containing all the input lists `arr`.
- `flag` remains 0 as there is no condition to change its value within the loop.
- `ni` as the last input integer.
- `arr` as the last input list of integers.
- `s` as the sum of the last input list `arr`.
- `sk` as a list of unique elements from the last input list `arr`.

If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `k` is 0), the variables `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `arr`, `s`, and `sk` would still retain their initial values (empty dictionary, empty list, 0, 0, [], 0, []).
