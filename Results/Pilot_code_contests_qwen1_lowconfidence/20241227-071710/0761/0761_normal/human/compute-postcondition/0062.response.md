The code prints the values from the list `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`. Since the initial state specifies that `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, we can deduce that `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `l` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Therefore, the printed values will be:
- `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` which is `l + 1`
- `tk[i - s][1][1]` which is `arr.index(i) + 1`

No variables are updated by this code. The states of `sk`, `l`, `tk`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and the string 'YES l + 1 arr.index(i) + 1' is printed to the console, `sk` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `tk` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged.**
