To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute. The key variable here is `i`, which is being iterated over by the `sk` list.

Given the information:

- `tk[i - s]` is a list containing at least two tuples.
- If `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console prints a specific string.
- Other variables like `k`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `arr`, `s`, and `sk` remain unchanged.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Condition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value within the range defined by `sk`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue if `i` is still within the bounds of `sk`.

If the loop is continuing to the next iteration, it means `i` is being incremented by 1 (or some other increment mechanism is used), but importantly, `i` must still be a valid index in `sk`.

Since the only variable changing in the context of the loop itself is `i`, and all other variables remain unchanged, the state at the start of the next iteration will simply be `i` incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing at least two tuples, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`, and `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be a valid index in `sk`**. 

To express this clearly:
State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing at least two tuples, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`, and `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be a valid index in `sk`**.
