The code `jam.append(arr)` appends the list `arr` to the list `jam`. This means that `arr` (a list of integers) is added as a new element to the existing list `jam`. 

- `k` remains an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `tk` remains an empty dictionary.
- `jam` now contains the list `arr` as its first (and only) element since this is the first append operation.
- `flag` remains 0.
- `ni` remains an input integer.
- `arr` remains the list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`**.
