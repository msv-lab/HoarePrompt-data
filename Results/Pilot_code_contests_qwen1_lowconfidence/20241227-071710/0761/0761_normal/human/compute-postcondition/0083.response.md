The code snippet provided does not contain any assignment to a variable named `tk` or `i` or `s`. Instead, it attempts to assign a default value to an element in a dictionary `tk` using the key `i - s`. However, since `tk`, `i`, and `s` are not defined in the given initial state, this line of code does not modify any existing variables. 

The initial conditions remain unchanged after attempting to execute the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element**
