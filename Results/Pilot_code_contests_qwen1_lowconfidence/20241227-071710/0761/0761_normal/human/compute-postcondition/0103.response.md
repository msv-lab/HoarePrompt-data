The code snippet assigns `tk.get(i - s, [])` to `tk[i - s]`. However, the values of `i` and `s` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value that `tk[i - s]` will be assigned. We only know that `tk[i - s]` will be set to an empty list if `i - s` is not already a key in the dictionary `tk`.

Since no specific values for `i` and `s` are provided, we can only state that `tk[i - s]` will be an empty list.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, `tk[i - s]` is an empty list**
