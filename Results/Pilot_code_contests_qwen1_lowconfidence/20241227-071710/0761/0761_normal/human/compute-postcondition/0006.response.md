The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, and converts each string into an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `arr`. The original values of `k`, `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, and `ni` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `arr` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is an empty list, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`**
