`tk[i - s]` is appended with a new tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The console print operation and the condition check for `jam` values remain unaffected. The output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is either the existing list or an empty list with an additional element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`, and `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be a valid index in `sk`.**
