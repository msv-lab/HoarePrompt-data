The code prints the values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]`. Based on the initial state, `tk[i - s]` contains an additional tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but its new value is not relevant to the output of the print statement. The output of the print statement is the specific values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]`.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` now contains an additional tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, and the print statement outputs the values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]`**
