Postcondition: ***`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element. If the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1 and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the printed output is `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
