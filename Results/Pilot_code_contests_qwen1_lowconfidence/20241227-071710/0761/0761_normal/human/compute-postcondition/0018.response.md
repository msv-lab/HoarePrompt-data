The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without changing any variables or performing any operations. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing at least two tuples, `k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` and must contain at least one element, the console prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`.**
