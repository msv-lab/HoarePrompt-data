Postcondition: ***`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, and `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`. The program will output 'YES' and print `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)` before exiting if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`. If `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the variables retain their original states without any specific changes.***
