Postcondition: ***`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list with more than one element including `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)`. If `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console prints 'YES', `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` is `k + 1`, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`, `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` are printed, and the program terminates. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables' values.***
