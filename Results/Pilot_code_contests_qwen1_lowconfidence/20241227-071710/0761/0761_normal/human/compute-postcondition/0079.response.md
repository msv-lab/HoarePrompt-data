`jam.append(arr)` appends the list `arr` to the list `jam`. The value of `l` remains 0, the condition that `k` is greater than itself is not relevant since `k` is not used in the code, `ni` is an input integer and is not affected, and `arr` remains a list of integers entered by the user. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is 0, `k` is greater than itself, `ni` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than itself, `ni` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`.**
