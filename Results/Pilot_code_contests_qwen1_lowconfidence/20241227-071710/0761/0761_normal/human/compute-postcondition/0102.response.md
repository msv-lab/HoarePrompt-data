According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `sk`. At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, and `sk` must have at least one element. The condition for continuing the loop is that `sk` must not be empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sk` must still have at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `sk` still contains at least one element at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element**
