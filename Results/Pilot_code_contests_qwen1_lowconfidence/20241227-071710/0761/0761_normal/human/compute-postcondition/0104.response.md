`tk[i - s]` is an empty list, so appending `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to this list changes its state. Since `l` is 0 and `arr.index(i) + 1` gives the index of `i` in `arr` plus one, the new state of `tk[i - s]` will be a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`. The values of `l`, `k`, `arr`, and `sk` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`**
