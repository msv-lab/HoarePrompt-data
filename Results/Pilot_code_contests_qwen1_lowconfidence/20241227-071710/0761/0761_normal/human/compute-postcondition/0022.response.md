`tk[i - s]` is set to `tk.get(i - s, [])`. This means that if there is already a value at `tk[i - s]`, it remains unchanged. If there is no value at `tk[i - s]`, it is set to an empty list. The console print and increment of `i` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is either the existing list or an empty list, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`, and `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be a valid index in `sk`**
