The code `ni = int(raw_input())` assigns the integer value of the input received from the user to the variable `ni`. The initial state indicates that `l` is 0 and `k` must be greater than `k` (which implies `k` is not defined in the current context). The raw_input function waits for user input, but since no specific input value is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ni`. However, we know that `l` remains 0 and the condition for `k` is still valid.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` must be greater than `k`, `ni` is an input integer**
