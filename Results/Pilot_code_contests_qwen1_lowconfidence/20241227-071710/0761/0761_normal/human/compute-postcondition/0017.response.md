The code `print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))` is executed, which concatenates and prints the string formed by adding 1 to the second element of the second tuple in `tk[i - s]` and then concatenating it with the first element of the same tuple.

- `tk[i - s][1][0]` is an integer from the list stored in `tk[i - s]`.
- `tk[i - s][1][1]` is another integer from the same list.

After the code runs, the values of `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `arr`, `s`, and `sk` remain unchanged. However, the console now prints the concatenated string, and the value of `tk[i - s][1][0]` is incremented by 1 and then used in the print statement.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing at least two tuples, `k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` and must contain at least one element, the console prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`.**
