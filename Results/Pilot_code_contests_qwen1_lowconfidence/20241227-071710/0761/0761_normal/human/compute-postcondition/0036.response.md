The `exit(0)` function call terminates the program immediately with a status code of 0. This means that no further code in the program will be executed, and the current state of variables will not change.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` now contains an additional tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the print statement has been executed (outputting the values of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`), and the program has terminated.**
