The code initializes an empty list named `jam`. This does not affect the value of `k` or `tk`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`k` is the integer input from the user, and it satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `tk` is an empty dictionary; `jam` is an empty list**
