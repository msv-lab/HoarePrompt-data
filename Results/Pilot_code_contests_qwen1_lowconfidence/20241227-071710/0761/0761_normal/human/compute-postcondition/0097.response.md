The code snippet prints the sum of the first element of the tuple in `tk[i - s]` plus 1 and the second element of the same tuple. The variables `l` and `k` are not affected by this code, and the conditions about `arr`, `sk`, and `tk` remain unchanged except for the mentioned updates.

Given the initial state:
- `l` is 0
- `k` is greater than 0
- `arr` must have at least one unique integer
- `sk` must have at least one element
- `tk[i - s]` is updated to contain the additional tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`

The code executes and prints the values from the tuple in `tk[i - s]`. Since `tk[i - s]` is updated to contain `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`, the printed values will be `1` (since `0 + 1 = 1`) and `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, `tk[i - s]` contains the tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1), and the console prints '1 arr.index(i) + 1'.**
