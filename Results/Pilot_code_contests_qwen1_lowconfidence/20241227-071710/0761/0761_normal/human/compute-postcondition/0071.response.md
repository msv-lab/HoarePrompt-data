The code prints the values of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`. Since the exact values of `tk[i - s][1][0]` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` are not specified, let's denote them as `a` and `b` respectively. Thus, the printed values are `a + 1` and `b`.

The variables `sk`, `l`, `tk[i - s]`, and `jam` remain unchanged, and the console outputs 'YES'.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least two elements, `l` is the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is now the list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` and the newly appended tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` for the next element in `sk`; the console outputs 'YES', and the printed values are `a + 1` and `b`**.
