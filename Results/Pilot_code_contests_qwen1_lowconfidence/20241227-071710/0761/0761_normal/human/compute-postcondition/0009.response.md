The code `sk = list(set(arr))` creates a list of unique elements from the list `arr`. Since `arr` is already defined and contains integers, the set operation will remove any duplicate values in `arr`, and then converting it back to a list. The output state will reflect this change.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `tk` is an empty dictionary
- `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`
- `flag` is 0
- `ni` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`
- `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`

After executing `sk = list(set(arr))`:
- `sk` will be a list of unique elements from `arr`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `tk` is an empty dictionary; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`.**
