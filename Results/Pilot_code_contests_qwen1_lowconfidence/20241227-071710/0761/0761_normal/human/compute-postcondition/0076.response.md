According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `k-1`. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `l` will be equal to `k-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is `k-1`
- `k` must be greater than `k-1` for the loop to execute again.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`l` is 0, `k` must be greater than `k` (i.e., `k` must be `k+1`)**
