The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately with a status code of 0. Since the program is terminated, no further code is executed, and no changes occur to any variables. The initial conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and the string 'YES l + 1 arr.index(i) + 1' is printed to the console, `sk` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `tk` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged.**
