The code `sk = list(set(arr))` creates a new list `sk` that contains unique elements from the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, the values in `sk` will be the unique integers from `arr`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than itself, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`.**
