The code prints the sum of the first element of the tuple in `tk[i - s][0]` plus 1 and the second element of the tuple in `tk[i - s][0]`. This means that the value of `tk[i - s][0]` is a tuple, and the output will be in the form of a string combining these two values.

- `tk[i - s][0][0]` is the first element of the tuple, which is `l`.
- `tk[i - s][0][1]` is the second element of the tuple, which is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `"l + 1" + " " + "arr.index(i) + 1"`.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and the string 'YES l + 1 arr.index(i) + 1' is printed to the console.**
