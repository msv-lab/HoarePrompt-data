The code `print('YES')` does not modify any variables. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `l`, `k`, `arr`, `sk`, and `tk[i - s]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1), and the console outputs 'YES'**
