`s` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr` twice; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an integer input from the user; `arr` is a list of integers; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`; `l` is now `k`.
