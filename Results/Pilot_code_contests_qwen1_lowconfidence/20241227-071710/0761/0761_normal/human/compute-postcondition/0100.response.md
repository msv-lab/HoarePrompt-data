Postcondition: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element. If `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console prints '1 arr.index(i) + 1' before exiting. Otherwise, no additional changes occur and the program continues as normal.**
