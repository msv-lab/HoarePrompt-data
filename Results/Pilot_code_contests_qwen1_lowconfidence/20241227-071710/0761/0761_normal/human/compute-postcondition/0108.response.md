The `exit(0)` function call terminates the program immediately with a status code of 0. This means that no further code in the current block will be executed, and the program ends.

Given the initial state and the impact of `exit(0)`, the following variables are affected:
- `l` remains unchanged as it is set to 0.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is greater than 0.
- `arr` remains unchanged as it must have at least one unique integer.
- `sk` remains unchanged as it must have at least one element.
- `tk[i - s]` remains unchanged as it is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
- The console outputs 'YES' and prints `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)` before the program exits.

Since the program exits immediately after this line, no other variables are updated, and the output of 'YES' and the print statement are the final actions performed.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1), the console outputs 'YES', and prints `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)` before exiting.**
