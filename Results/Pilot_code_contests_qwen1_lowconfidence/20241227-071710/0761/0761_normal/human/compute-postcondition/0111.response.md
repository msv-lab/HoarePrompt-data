Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `sk` is a list of unique integers from `arr`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`, `tk` is a dictionary where keys are integers derived from elements in `sk` and values are lists of tuples, each tuple contains the index of the element in `arr` and its value. The loop exits when it finds two distinct indices with different sums in `jam` and prints the corresponding indices, otherwise the program ends without printing anything.**
