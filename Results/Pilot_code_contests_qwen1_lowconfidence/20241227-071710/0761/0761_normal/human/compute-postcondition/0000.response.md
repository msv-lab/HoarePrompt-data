The code `k = int(raw_input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `k`. Since the initial state defines that `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), after executing this line of code, the value of `k` will be set to the integer input provided by the user, and it will still satisfy the condition \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

Output State: **`k` is the integer input from the user, and it satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)**
