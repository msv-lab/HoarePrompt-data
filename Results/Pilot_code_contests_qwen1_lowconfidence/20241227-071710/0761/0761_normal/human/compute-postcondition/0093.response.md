Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `sk`.
2. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `arr` must have at least one unique integer.
   - `sk` must have at least one element.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know from the condition that if the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1 and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, it prints an output. However, since the exact body is not given, we focus on how the states change with each iteration.

4. **Determine Changes After One Iteration**:
   - Since `sk` must have at least one element, and we are iterating over each element in `sk`, the first element of `sk` is taken as `i` in the current iteration.
   - After processing the first element, there will be no elements left in `sk` for the next iteration unless `sk` is replenished somehow, which is not mentioned in the given conditions.
   - The states of `l`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body based on the provided information.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `l` remains 0 because there is no indication that `l` changes inside the loop.
   - `k` remains greater than 0 because the loop continues as long as `sk` has elements.
   - `arr` remains having at least one unique integer as it is not modified.
   - `sk` now has one less element than before, meaning it must have at least one element to proceed, but after the first iteration, it will have 0 elements left.

Given these observations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element (after the first iteration, it will have 0 elements left, but for the loop to continue, it must have at least one element)**.

Since the loop will only execute once based on the given conditions, the final state after the first iteration is:

**State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element (but for the loop to continue, it must have at least one element)**.

However, if we strictly follow the example format and consider the state just after the first iteration:

**State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element (but for the loop to continue, it must have at least one element)**.

This means the state should reflect the condition for the next iteration, where `sk` must still have at least one element to continue.
