Postcondition: ***`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is the next value of `k`, and `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`. If `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, then the string 'YES l + 1 arr.index(i) + 1' is printed to the console, and the values of `sk`, `l`, `tk`, and `arr` remain unchanged. If the condition is false, no additional changes occur to the variables.***
