The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it processes a series of sequences, each defined by its length and the elements within it. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, but based on the problem description, it seems to process these sequences and might return some result or perform some action.

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- Each sequence is represented by two lines: the first line contains an integer \(n_i\) (where \(1 \leq n_i < 2 \cdot 10^5\)) indicating the length of the \(i\)-th sequence, and the second line contains \(n_i\) integers \(a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \ldots, a_{i, n_i}\) representing the elements of the sequence.
- The elements of the sequences are integer numbers from \(-10^4\) to \(10^4\).
- The sum of the lengths of all given sequences does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Since the function signature does not include any parameters and no return value is specified in the given code snippet, the functionality can be described as accepting a series of sequences through some external mechanism (not shown in the provided code).

Functionality: **The function processes a series of sequences, each defined by its length and the elements within it, without accepting any explicit parameters and does not return any value.**
