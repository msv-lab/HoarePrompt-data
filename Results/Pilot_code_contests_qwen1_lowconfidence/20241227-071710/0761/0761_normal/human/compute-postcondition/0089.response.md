The code prints the value of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` followed by a space and then `tk[i - s][1][1]`. The values of `tk[i - s][1][0]` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` are not specified in the initial state, but they are used in the print statement. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, and the printed output is `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`.**
