Functionality: **The function processes a series of sequences, each defined by its length and the elements within it. It checks if there exist two distinct sequences such that the sum of one sequence equals the sum of another sequence plus the difference between two elements within those sequences. If such a pair of sequences is found, it prints "YES" along with the indices of the elements in the two sequences that satisfy this condition. If no such pair is found after checking all sequences, it prints "NO". The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include handling sequences of varying lengths and ensuring the uniqueness of elements within each sequence.**
