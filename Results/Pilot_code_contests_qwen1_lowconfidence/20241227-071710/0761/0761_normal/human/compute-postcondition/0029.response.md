Postcondition: ***`tk[i - s]` is either the existing list or an empty list with an additional element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])` if the condition `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` is true, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition is false, no further action is taken.***
