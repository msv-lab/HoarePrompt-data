The provided code snippet contains several issues that prevent it from running correctly. Specifically, the variables `tk`, `i`, `s`, and `arr` are used without being defined in the given context. Additionally, `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))` suggests that `tk` is expected to be a list of lists, and `i` and `s` should be defined in a way that `i - s` is a valid index for `tk`. However, these variables are not provided in the initial state.

Given the initial state and the lack of defined variables in the code snippet, it's impossible to determine the exact impact on the variables. We can only conclude that the code attempts to append a tuple to a list, but due to the undefined variables, no meaningful update can be made to the initial state.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, and the code attempts to modify `tk` but fails due to undefined variables.**
