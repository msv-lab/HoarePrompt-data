Postcondition: ***`tk[i - s]` is a list containing at least two tuples, `k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` and must contain at least one element, if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the console prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`; otherwise, the program continues without printing anything.***
