The `exit(0)` function call will terminate the program immediately, and no further code will be executed. This means that the variables `sk`, `l`, `tk[i - s]`, and the print statements will not be affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list with more than one element including `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)`, the console prints 'YES', `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` is `k + 1`, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`, `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` are printed. The program terminates.**
