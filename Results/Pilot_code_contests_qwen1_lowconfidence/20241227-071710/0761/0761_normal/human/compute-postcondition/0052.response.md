The code snippet prints the values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` as strings separated by a space. 

Given the initial state:
- `sk` contains at least one element.
- `l` is now `k`.
- `tk[i - s]` is a list with more than one element and includes `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
- The value of `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is different from the value of `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`.

The values of `tk[i - s][0][0]` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` are already defined in the initial state. Specifically, `tk[i - s][0][0]` is `k` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Therefore, the printed output will be the string representation of `k + 1` followed by the string representation of `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list with more than one element including `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and the console prints 'YES'; `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` is `k + 1`, `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.**
