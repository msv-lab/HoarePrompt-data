The code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `ni`. The variable `k` remains unchanged, and the values of `tk` and `jam` also remain the same. The `flag` variable remains 0.

Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is an empty list, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer**
