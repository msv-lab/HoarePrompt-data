Let's analyze the given code step by step:

- Initial State: `sk` must contain at least one element, `l` is now `k`.
- Code: `tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])`

Here, the code assigns `tk.get(i - s, [])` to `tk[i - s]`. This means:
1. If `tk[i - s]` already exists in `tk`, its value remains unchanged.
2. If `tk[i - s]` does not exist in `tk`, `tk[i - s]` is set to `[]`.

Given that no specific values for `i`, `s`, `tk`, and `k` are provided, we can only describe the impact based on the logic of the code.

- The value of `tk[i - s]` is updated based on whether it already exists in `tk` or not.
- The values of `sk` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`sk` must contain at least one element, `l` is now `k`, and `tk[i - s]` is either the existing value of `tk[i - s]` or `[]` depending on whether `tk[i - s]` was already defined or not.**
