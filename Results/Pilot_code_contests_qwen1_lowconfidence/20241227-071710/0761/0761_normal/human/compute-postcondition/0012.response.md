The code snippet `tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))` impacts the dictionary `tk` by appending a tuple to the list associated with the key `i - s`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Dictionary Update**: `tk[i - s]` was initially an empty list. After running the code, `tk[i - s]` now contains the appended tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
2. **Other Variables**: No other variables (`k`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `arr`, `s`, `sk`) are directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated state includes `tk[i - s]` having a new entry, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `tk` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i - s` and the value is a list containing the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` and must contain at least one element.**
