The code `exit(0)` causes the program to terminate immediately with a status code of 0. This means that no further code is executed after this point, and all variables remain in their current states.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, and the printed output is `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`. The program terminates.**
