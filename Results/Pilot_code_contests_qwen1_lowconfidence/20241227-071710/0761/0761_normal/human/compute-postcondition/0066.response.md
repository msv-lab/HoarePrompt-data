According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the set `sk`. If `sk` contains at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sk` contains at least one element, `l` is the next value of `k`, and `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.

The condition to print 'YES l + 1 arr.index(i) + 1' is checked if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`. If this condition is true, `sk`, `l`, `tk`, and `arr` remain unchanged. However, if the condition is false, no additional changes occur to the variables.

For the loop to execute one more time, the only change needed is to adjust the value of `i` to the next element in `sk`.

State: **`sk` contains at least two elements, `l` is the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` for the next element in `sk`.**
