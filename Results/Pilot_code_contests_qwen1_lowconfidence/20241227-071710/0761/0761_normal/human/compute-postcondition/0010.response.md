According to the given for loop statement:

```python
for i in sk:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Let's analyze the required states for the loop to execute:

1. **`sk`**: The variable `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`. For the loop to execute, `sk` must contain at least one element.
2. **`i`**: The loop iterates over each element in `sk`, so `i` will take the value of each element in `sk`.

Considering these points, we need to ensure that `sk` contains at least one element before the loop starts. Here are the relevant states that need to be adjusted:

- `sk` must contain at least one element (since `sk` is derived from `arr`, it must be non-empty).
- All other variables (`k`, `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, `ni`, `arr`, `s`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself.

Thus, the final output state should include the condition that `sk` must contain at least one element.

**State: **`k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `tk` is an empty dictionary; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` and must contain at least one element.**
