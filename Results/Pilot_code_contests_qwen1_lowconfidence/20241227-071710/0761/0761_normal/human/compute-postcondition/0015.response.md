The code `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not change any of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list containing at least two tuples, `k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `tk` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i - s` and the value is a list containing at least two tuples, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`, `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr` and must contain at least one element, the console prints 'YES'.**
