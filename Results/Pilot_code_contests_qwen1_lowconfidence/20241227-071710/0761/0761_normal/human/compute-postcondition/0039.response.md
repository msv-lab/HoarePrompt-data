Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each unique element `i` in `sk`.
- For each `i`, it checks if the difference `i - s` exists in the dictionary `tk` as a key.
- If the key does not exist, it initializes it with an empty list.
- It appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list corresponding to the key `i - s`.
- If the length of the list corresponding to the key `i - s` becomes greater than 1, it checks if the values of `jam` at the positions specified by the tuples are different.
- If they are different, it prints the required output and exits the program.

After the loop completes all iterations:
- `tk` will contain all the necessary entries based on the differences between elements of `sk` and `s`.
- `jam` remains unchanged.
- `flag` remains 0.
- `ni` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `sk` remains unchanged.

Since the loop may not execute at all (if no valid pairs are found), the values of `tk` will reflect the state after all possible additions of tuples during the iterations, ensuring that the conditions for printing are checked.
