The `print('YES')` statement does not affect the values of the variables `sk`, `l`, or `tk[i - s]`. It only outputs the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and the string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
