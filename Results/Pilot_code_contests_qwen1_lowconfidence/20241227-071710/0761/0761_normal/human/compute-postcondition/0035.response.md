The code snippet prints the values of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`. Since the initial state includes that `tk[i - s]` now contains an additional tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` and the print statement outputs these values, we know that `tk[i - s][1][0]` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` are specific values that will be printed. However, the exact values of these elements are not specified in the initial state, so we can only denote them as they were before the print operation.

No variables are assigned new values or changed within the given code snippet. The print statement merely outputs the values of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` without altering the state.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` now contains an additional tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, and the print statement outputs the values of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`.**
