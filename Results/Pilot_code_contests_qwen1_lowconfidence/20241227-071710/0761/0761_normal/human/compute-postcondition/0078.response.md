The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converts them to integers, and stores them in the list `arr`. The variable `l` is initially set to 0, `k` is initially stated to be greater than itself (which means `k` can be any value greater than itself, but since no specific value was given, we keep it as is), and `ni` is an input integer.

After executing the code, `l` remains unchanged as 0, `k` remains greater than itself, and `ni` remains an input integer. However, now there is a new list `arr` which contains the integers input by the user.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than itself, `ni` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.**
