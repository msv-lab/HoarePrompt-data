`s` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `arr`. The sum of the elements in `arr` is calculated using the `sum()` function. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is 0, `k` is greater than itself, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, and `s` is the sum of the elements in `arr`.
