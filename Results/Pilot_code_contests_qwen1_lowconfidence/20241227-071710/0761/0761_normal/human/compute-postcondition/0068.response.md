The code appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. Given the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is either an existing list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` or an empty list. After appending, `tk[i - s]` will contain this new tuple. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `tk[i - s]` now contains the existing element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` and the newly appended tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
- `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` remains true because the new tuple does not affect the condition.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least two elements, `l` is the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is now the list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` and the newly appended tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` for the next element in `sk`.**
