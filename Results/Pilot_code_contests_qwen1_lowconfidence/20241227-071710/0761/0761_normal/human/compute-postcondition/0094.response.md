The code snippet `tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])` impacts the `tk` dictionary by setting the key `i - s` to an empty list if it does not already exist in the dictionary. However, the initial state of `tk` is not specified. We know that `i` and `s` are not defined, which means they could have any values. Since their specific values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact state of `tk`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `l` is 0
- `k` is greater than 0
- `arr` must have at least one unique integer
- `sk` must have at least one element (but for the loop to continue, it must have at least one element)

Since `tk` is not initialized, and `i` and `s` are not defined, the code snippet only affects the definition of `tk`. After the execution of the code, `tk` will have the key `i - s` mapped to an empty list if `i - s` was not already a key in `tk`.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, and `tk` is updated such that if `i - s` is not already a key in `tk`, it is added with the value `[]`.**
