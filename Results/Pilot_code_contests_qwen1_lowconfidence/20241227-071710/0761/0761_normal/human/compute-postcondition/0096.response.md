The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the only change is the output to the console, but this does not alter the values of the variables.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, and `tk` is updated such that `tk[i - s]` now contains the additional tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1). The console prints 'YES'.**
