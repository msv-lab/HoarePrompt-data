The code `print('YES')` does not change any of the variables in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, the length of `tk[i - s]` is greater than 1, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`**
