To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step-by-step and consider the possible scenarios based on the provided information.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is an integer input from the user such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`.
   - `jam` is a list containing the list `arr` twice.
   - `flag` is 0.
   - `ni` is an integer input from the user.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.
   - `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`.
   - `l` is now `k`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `i` in `sk`, the following operations are performed:
     - `tk[i - s]` is updated to be a list (if it doesn't exist yet) and then a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` is appended to it.
     - If the length of `tk[i - s]` becomes greater than 1, the following conditions are checked:
       - `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`
       - If the above condition is true, the loop prints "YES" and specific indices, then exits.

### Loop Termination Conditions

- **Scenario 1:** The loop does not execute at all.
  - This means `sk` is either empty or the conditions inside the loop never get met. Therefore, `tk` remains as defined initially, `jam` remains as defined initially, and other variables like `l`, `s`, `sk`, etc., remain unchanged.
  - Output State: **`sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr` twice, `l` is still `k`, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`, and the program does not print anything.**

- **Scenario 2:** The loop executes at least once and possibly multiple times.
  - The loop will continue to append tuples to `tk[i - s]` until its length exceeds 1. At that point, if `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, the loop will print "YES" and specific indices and then exit.
  - After the loop exits, `tk` will contain lists for some keys (differences between elements of `sk` and `s`), and these lists may contain more than one tuple. The value of `l` will be updated to the last value of `k` (or possibly incremented further if the loop continued beyond the first iteration).

### Final Output State

Given the above analysis, the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is as follows:

**Output State:**
- `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`.
- `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`.
- `jam` is a list containing the list `arr` twice.
- `l` is the final value of `k` (or possibly incremented further).
- `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.
- If the loop executed and found a valid pair of indices, the program will have printed "YES" along with specific indices. If the loop did not find such a pair, the program will not print anything.

**Output State:**
**`sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr` twice, `l` is the final value of `k`, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`, and the program either prints "YES" followed by specific indices or does not print anything.**
