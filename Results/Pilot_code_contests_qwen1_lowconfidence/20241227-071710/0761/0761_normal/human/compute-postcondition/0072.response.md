The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without further execution of any subsequent statements. This means that no changes are made to the variables, and the program does not proceed beyond this point.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least two elements, `l` is the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is now the list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` and the newly appended tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` for the next element in `sk`; the console outputs 'YES', and the printed values are `a + 1` and `b`. The program ends.**
