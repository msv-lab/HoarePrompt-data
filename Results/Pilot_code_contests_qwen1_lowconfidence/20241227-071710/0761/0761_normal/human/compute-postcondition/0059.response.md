`tk[i - s]` is a list, and the code appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to this list. The values of `sk`, `l`, and `tk[i - s]` are updated as follows:

- `sk` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- `l` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- `tk[i - s]` gains a new element, which is the tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`**
