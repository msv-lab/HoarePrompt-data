The code `print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))` is executed, which prints the sum of `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][1][1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `l` is 0,
- `k` is greater than 0,
- `arr` must have at least one unique integer,
- `sk` must have at least one element,
- `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`,
- the console outputs 'YES'; the printed values are `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)`.

From the initial state, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`. Therefore, `tk[i - s][1][0]` is `0` and `tk[i - s][1][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`.

So, the expression `tk[i - s][1][0] + 1` evaluates to `1`, and the expression `tk[i - s][1][1]` remains `arr.index(i) + 1`.

Thus, the print statement will output `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1), and the console outputs 'YES'; the printed values are `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)`**.
