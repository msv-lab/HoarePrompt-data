The code prints the values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` concatenated into a string. The values of these variables are not changed by the print statement, only used within it. The states of the other variables (`sk`, `l`, `tk`, `jam`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least two elements, `l` is the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is now the list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` and the newly appended tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` for the next element in `sk`; the console outputs 'YES'**
