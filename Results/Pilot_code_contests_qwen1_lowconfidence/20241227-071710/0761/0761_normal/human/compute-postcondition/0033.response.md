The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This does not change the values of any variables but does indicate that the print statement was executed. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list with more than one element, `tk[i - s]` now contains an additional tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, and `i` is incremented by 1**
