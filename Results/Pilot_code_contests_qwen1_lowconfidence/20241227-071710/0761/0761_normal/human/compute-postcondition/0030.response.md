To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions given and analyze them step by step.

### Given Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:
1. `tk[i - s]` is either the existing list or an empty list with an additional element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`.
2. `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` (if `len(tk[i - s]) > 1`).
3. The console prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])` if the condition `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` is true.
4. `i` is incremented by 1 if the condition `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` is true. If the condition is false, no further action is taken.

### Analyzing the Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `sk`, meaning it continues as long as there are elements in `sk`.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The increment of `i` happens only when `len(tk[i - s]) > 1`.
- If `len(tk[i - s]) <= 1`, no further action is taken, and the loop would terminate based on the elements in `sk`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition for Incrementing `i`:**
   - The condition `len(tk[i - s]) > 1` must be true for `i` to be incremented.
   - If this condition is false, the loop terminates, and `i` is not incremented.

2. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop continues only if `len(tk[i - s]) > 1`, we need to ensure that `tk[i - s]` meets this condition.
   - The value of `i` is incremented by 1 if the condition is true.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `tk[i - s]` must have more than one element (`len(tk[i - s]) > 1`). If this condition is met, `i` will be incremented by 1.

### Final State:
State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list with more than one element, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

If `tk[i - s]` does not have more than one element, the loop will terminate.

### Answer:
State: **`tk[i - s]` is a list with more than one element, `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`, and `i` is incremented by 1**.
