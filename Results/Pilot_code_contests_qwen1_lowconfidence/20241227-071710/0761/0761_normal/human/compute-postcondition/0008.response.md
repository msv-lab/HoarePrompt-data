`s` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the list `arr`. The sum function adds up all the integers in the list `arr`, which was obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The value of `k`, `tk`, `jam`, `flag`, and `ni` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `tk` is an empty dictionary, `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`, `flag` is 0, `ni` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, and `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.
