The code prints the string formed by `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`. This means that the first part of the tuple `tk[i - s][1]` (which is `tk[i - s][1][0]`) is incremented by 1, and then concatenated with the second part of the tuple `tk[i - s][1][1]`.

After the print statement, the variable `i` is incremented by 1, and it must still be a valid index in `sk`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- The console prints the string `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **The console prints the string `str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1])`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
