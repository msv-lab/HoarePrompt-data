The code `print('YES')` does not affect any variable values or states; it only prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `sk`, `l`, `tk`, `i`, `s`, `arr`, `jam`, and any other variables mentioned in the precondition remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least two elements, `l` is the next value of `k`, `tk[i - s]` is now the list containing the element `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` and the newly appended tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is not equal to `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]` for the next element in `sk`. The console outputs 'YES'**
