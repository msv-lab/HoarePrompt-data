The code prints the values of `tk[i - s][0][0] + 1` and `tk[i - s][0][1]`. Given the precondition, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`. Therefore, `tk[i - s][0][0]` is `0` and `tk[i - s][0][1]` is `arr.index(i) + 1`. The output will be `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)`.

The states of the other variables (`l`, `k`, `arr`, `sk`, `tk`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and the console outputs 'YES'; the printed values are `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)`.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, `tk[i - s]` is a list containing a single tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`, and the console outputs 'YES'; the printed values are `1 (arr.index(i) + 1)`**.
