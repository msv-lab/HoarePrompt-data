The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. Since the program exits right away, none of the variables are updated, and the only information from the initial state that remains valid is the console print statement, which occurs before the exit.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, and the console printed '1 arr.index(i) + 1' before exiting.**
