The code appends a tuple `(l, arr.index(i) + 1)` to the list `tk[i - s]`. However, the specific values of `i` and `s` are not provided. We know that `l` is initially 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, and `sk` must have at least one element. Since the exact values of `i` and `s` are not given, we cannot determine the exact value of `tk[i - s]`.

Given that `tk[i - s]` is appended to, the structure of `tk` remains unchanged except for the addition of the tuple. The output state includes the updated `tk` with the new tuple appended to `tk[i - s]`.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `arr` must have at least one unique integer, `sk` must have at least one element, and `tk` is updated such that `tk[i - s]` now contains the additional tuple `(0, arr.index(i) + 1)`.**
