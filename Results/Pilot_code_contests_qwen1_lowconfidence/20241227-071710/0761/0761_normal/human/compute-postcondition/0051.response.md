The code `print('YES')` does not modify any variables or their values. It only prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `sk`, `l`, `tk`, and `jam` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sk` contains at least one element, `l` is now `k`, `tk[i - s]` is updated to include `(k, arr.index(i) + 1)` and is a list with more than one element, and the value of `jam[tk[i - s][0][0]]` is different from the value of `jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]`. The console prints 'YES'**
