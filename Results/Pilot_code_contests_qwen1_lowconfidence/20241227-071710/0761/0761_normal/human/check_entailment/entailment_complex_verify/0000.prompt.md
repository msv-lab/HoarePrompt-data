You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given k sequences of integers. The length of the i-th sequence equals to n_i.

You have to choose exactly two sequences i and j (i ≠ j) such that you can remove exactly one element in each of them in such a way that the sum of the changed sequence i (its length will be equal to n_i - 1) equals to the sum of the changed sequence j (its length will be equal to n_j - 1).

Note that it's required to remove exactly one element in each of the two chosen sequences.

Assume that the sum of the empty (of the length equals 0) sequence is 0.

Input

The first line contains an integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of sequences.

Then k pairs of lines follow, each pair containing a sequence.

The first line in the i-th pair contains one integer n_i (1 ≤ n_i < 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the i-th sequence. The second line of the i-th pair contains a sequence of n_i integers a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, ..., a_{i, n_i}.

The elements of sequences are integer numbers from -10^4 to 10^4.

The sum of lengths of all given sequences don't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, i.e. n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

If it is impossible to choose two sequences such that they satisfy given conditions, print "NO" (without quotes). Otherwise in the first line print "YES" (without quotes), in the second line — two integers i, x (1 ≤ i ≤ k, 1 ≤ x ≤ n_i), in the third line — two integers j, y (1 ≤ j ≤ k, 1 ≤ y ≤ n_j). It means that the sum of the elements of the i-th sequence without the element with index x equals to the sum of the elements of the j-th sequence without the element with index y.

Two chosen sequences must be distinct, i.e. i ≠ j. You can print them in any order.

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Output

2 2
4 1

Note

In the first example there are two sequences [2, 3, 1, 3, 2] and [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]. You can remove the second element from the first sequence to get [2, 1, 3, 2] and you can remove the sixth element from the second sequence to get [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]. The sums of the both resulting sequences equal to 8, i.e. the sums are equal.
Program:
```
def func():
    k = int(raw_input())
    tk = dict()
    jam = []
    flag = 0
    for l in range(k):
        ni = int(raw_input())
        arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        jam.append(arr)
        s = sum(arr)
        sk = list(set(arr))
        for i in sk:
            tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])
            tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))
            if len(tk[i - s]) > 1:
                if jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]:
                    print('YES')
                    print(str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1]))
                    print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))
                    exit(0)
    if not flag:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it checks for the condition of equal sums after removing one element from two different sequences. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the possibility of finding valid sequences that meet the criteria. Here’s a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
4
4 3 2 1
2
1 1
```

Expected output:
```
YES
1 1
2 1
```

However, the current implementation will fail to find this solution. The program uses a dictionary to store differences between sums and elements, but it does not correctly handle the case where the two sequences are different but still meet the condition of having equal sums after removing one element.

A more robust approach would involve calculating the difference in sums for each sequence and checking if there exists a match for any pair of sequences. The current implementation may miss valid cases due to its limited handling of set differences and sequence comparisons.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each sequence is represented by two lines: the first line contains an integer n_i (1 ≤ n_i < 2 ⋅ 10^5) indicating the length of the i-th sequence, and the second line contains n_i integers a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, ..., a_{i, n_i} representing the elements of the sequence. The elements of the sequences are integer numbers from -10^4 to 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all given sequences does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    k = int(raw_input())
    tk = dict()
    jam = []
    flag = 0
    for l in range(k):
        ni = int(raw_input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
        jam.append(arr)
        
        s = sum(arr)
        
        sk = list(set(arr))
        
        for i in sk:
            tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])
            tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))
            if len(tk[i - s]) > 1:
                if jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]:
                    print('YES')
                    print(str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1]))
                    print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))
                    exit(0)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` is an integer input from the user that satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`; `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`; `flag` is 0; `ni` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`; `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`.
    if (not flag) :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`k` is an integer satisfying \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). `tk` is a dictionary where keys are differences between elements of `sk` and `s`, and values are lists of tuples containing indices `l` and the position of the element in `arr`. `jam` is a list containing the list `arr`. `flag` remains 0. `ni` is an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers. `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`. `sk` is a list of unique elements from `arr`. The program prints "NO".
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of sequences, each defined by its length and the elements within it. It checks if there exist two distinct sequences such that the sum of one sequence equals the sum of another sequence plus the difference between two elements within those sequences. If such a pair of sequences is found, it prints "YES" along with the indices of the elements in the two sequences that satisfy this condition. If no such pair is found after checking all sequences, it prints "NO". The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Potential edge cases include handling sequences of varying lengths and ensuring the uniqueness of elements within each sequence.
