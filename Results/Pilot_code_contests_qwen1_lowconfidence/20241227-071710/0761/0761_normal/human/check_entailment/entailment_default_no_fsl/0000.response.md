Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the code fails to consider the requirement that we need to remove exactly one element from each of two different sequences such that the sums of the remaining elements in these two sequences are equal. Instead, the code is looking for pairs of elements in the same sequence whose removal would make the sums of the resulting sub-sequences equal, which is not the intended requirement.

Here is a specific case where the code fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
2
1 1
2
1 2
2
2 2
```

According to the problem description, the correct output should be "YES" followed by the indices of the elements that satisfy the condition. For instance:
```
YES
1 1
2 2
```

This is because if we remove the first element from the first sequence [1, 1], the sum becomes 1. Similarly, if we remove the second element from the second sequence [1, 2], the sum also becomes 1. However, the provided code will not produce this output because it is only considering elements within the same sequence and does not compare across different sequences.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem and hence the correctness is **False**.
