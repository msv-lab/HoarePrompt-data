Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of sequences `k` and then processes each sequence individually. It handles the input as described in the problem statement, reading the length of each sequence followed by the sequence itself.

2. **Sum Calculation and Difference Tracking**: For each sequence, the program calculates the sum of its elements (`s`). It then creates a set of unique elements (`sk`) and iterates over these unique elements to compute their differences from the sum (`s`). These differences are stored in the dictionary `tk`, where the key is the difference and the value is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the index `l` (0-based) and the position of the element in the original array.

3. **Finding Matching Pairs**: The program checks if there are any entries in `tk` where the list of tuples has more than one element. If found, it ensures that the two sequences corresponding to these entries are distinct and prints the required output. This step correctly identifies the sequences and positions where removing one element from each will result in equal sums.

4. **Output**: If no such pair of sequences is found, the program prints "NO", indicating that it's impossible to find the required sequences that meet the criteria.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as sequences of varying lengths and elements within the specified range. It also correctly deals with duplicate elements in a sequence by using sets to ensure uniqueness.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all necessary cases as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
