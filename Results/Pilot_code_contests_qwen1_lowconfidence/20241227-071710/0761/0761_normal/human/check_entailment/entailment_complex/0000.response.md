Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the integer `k` which represents the number of sequences.
   - For each sequence, it reads the length `n_i` and then reads the `n_i` integers forming the sequence.
   - The program handles valid inputs within the specified constraints, ensuring that `2 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5` and `1 ≤ n_i < 2 ⋅ 10^5`.

2. **Sum Calculation and Comparison**:
   - For each sequence, it calculates the sum `s` of all elements in the sequence.
   - It then creates a set of unique elements `sk` from the sequence.
   - For each unique element `i` in `sk`, it computes the difference `i - s` and checks if this difference exists as a key in the dictionary `tk`.
   - If the difference exists, it appends the current sequence index and the index of the element to the list associated with the key.
   - If the same difference is found again and the corresponding sequences are different, it prints "YES" followed by the indices and exits.

3. **Output**:
   - If no such pair of sequences is found after processing all sequences, the program prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where it needs to find two sequences with the same sum minus the respective removed elements.
   - It ensures that the sequences chosen are distinct.
   - The program does not explicitly handle invalid inputs (like non-integer inputs or invalid sequence lengths), but it is assumed that valid inputs will be provided.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description and handles the required logic as specified, the program is correct. Therefore, the answer is **True**.
