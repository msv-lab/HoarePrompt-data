Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it checks for the condition of equal sums after removing one element from two different sequences. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the possibility of finding valid sequences that meet the criteria. Hereâ€™s a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
4
4 3 2 1
2
1 1
```

Expected output:
```
YES
1 1
2 1
```

However, the current implementation will fail to find this solution. The program uses a dictionary to store differences between sums and elements, but it does not correctly handle the case where the two sequences are different but still meet the condition of having equal sums after removing one element.

A more robust approach would involve calculating the difference in sums for each sequence and checking if there exists a match for any pair of sequences. The current implementation may miss valid cases due to its limited handling of set differences and sequence comparisons.
