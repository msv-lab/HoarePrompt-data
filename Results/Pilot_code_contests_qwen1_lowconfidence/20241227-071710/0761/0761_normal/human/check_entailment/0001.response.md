Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the target difference exists within the same sequence. Specifically, the program only checks if the difference exists between different sequences and does not consider the possibility of removing an element from the same sequence to match the sums. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4
1 2 3 4
4
4 3 2 1
4
2 3 4 1
```

In this case, if we remove the element `2` from the first sequence, its sum becomes `9`. Similarly, if we remove the element `1` from the third sequence, its sum also becomes `9`. However, the program would not identify this scenario because it only checks differences between different sequences.

To fix this, the program needs to check for the same sequence condition as well. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    k = int(input())
    tk = dict()
    jam = []
    flag = 0
    for l in range(k):
        ni = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        jam.append(arr)
        s = sum(arr)
        sk = list(set(arr))
        for i in sk:
            tk[i - s] = tk.get(i - s, [])
            tk[i - s].append((l, arr.index(i) + 1))
            if len(tk[i - s]) > 1:
                if jam[tk[i - s][0][0]] != jam[tk[i - s][1][0]]:
                    print('YES')
                    print(str(tk[i - s][0][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][0][1]))
                    print(str(tk[i - s][1][0] + 1) + ' ' + str(tk[i - s][1][1]))
                    return
        # Check if there is a single element that can be removed to make the sequence sum match another sequence
        for i in range(ni):
            if jam[l] == jam[l][:i] + jam[l][i+1:]:
                print('YES')
                print(str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(i + 1))
                print(str(l + 1) + ' ' + str(i + 1))
                return
    print('NO')
```

This version of the function includes a check for the same sequence condition, ensuring that the program correctly identifies cases where the same sequence can have an element removed to match the sum of another sequence.
