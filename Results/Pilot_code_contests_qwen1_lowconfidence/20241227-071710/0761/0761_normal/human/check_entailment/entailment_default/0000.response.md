Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem description. Specifically, the code aims to find two sequences where removing one element from each results in equal sums. However, the current implementation does not fully address this requirement. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Sum Calculation**: The code attempts to find pairs of sequences where the sum of one sequence minus the value of an element equals the sum of another sequence minus the value of a different element. This approach is flawed because it does not directly check if the sums of the modified sequences are equal.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, it does not ensure that the two sequences chosen are distinct and that the removed elements are unique within their respective sequences. Additionally, it does not correctly calculate the sums of the modified sequences.

3. **Potential Missed Cases**: Consider the following example:
   ```
   Input:
   2
   3
   1 2 3
   3
   3 2 1
   ```
   The code should identify that removing the first element from the first sequence (sum: 2) and the third element from the second sequence (sum: 2) would result in equal sums. However, the current implementation might not catch this due to its flawed logic.

To correct this, the code needs to:
- Calculate the total sum of each sequence.
- For each sequence, compute the new sum if each element is removed.
- Compare these new sums across different sequences to find matching pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    k = int(input())
    sequences = []
    for _ in range(k):
        ni = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        sequences.append(arr)
    
    n = len(sequences)
    for i in range(n):
        seq1 = sequences[i]
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                seq2 = sequences[j]
                for x in range(len(seq1)):
                    modified_sum1 = sum(seq1[:x] + seq1[x+1:])
                    for y in range(len(seq2)):
                        modified_sum2 = sum(seq2[:y] + seq2[y+1:])
                        if modified_sum1 == modified_sum2:
                            print("YES")
                            print(f"{i+1} {x+1}")
                            print(f"{j+1} {y+1}")
                            return
    
    print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all necessary comparisons are made and handles the problem as described.
