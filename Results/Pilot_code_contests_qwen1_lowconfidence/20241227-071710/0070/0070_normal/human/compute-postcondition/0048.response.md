The code `maxNum = t[0]` assigns the first element of the tuple `t` to the variable `maxNum`. According to the initial state, `t` contains two elements, where the first element is `maxNum` (which is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the current element in `index`) and the second element is `ans` (which is the second element of `t`). 

Therefore, the value of `maxNum` is reassigned to itself, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`index` must have at least one element remaining, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the current element in `index`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, and `maxNum` is the first element of `t`.**
