The code assigns the result of the function call `func_1(x, y, z, i)` to the variable `t`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, and its behavior is unknown. Therefore, the impact of the function call cannot be determined without additional information about what `func_1` does.

Since the initial values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `maxNum`, `ans`, and `index` are known, and no other operations are performed on these variables besides the assignment of `t`, the only change is the introduction of `t`, which holds the return value from `func_1`.

Output State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `index` is a non-empty iterable, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`**
