`maxNum` is assigned the value of `t[0]`. Given that `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`, the value of `maxNum` is now `t[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is `t[0]`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`, `index` is a non-empty iterable**
