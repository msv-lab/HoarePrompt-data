Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ `x`, `y`, `z` ≤ 200.0, and each of `x`, `y`, and `z` is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point. At least one of `x`, `y`, or `z` is greater than or equal to 1. The maximum value among `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1.**
