To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `for` loop will run. The key point here is the structure of the `for` loop itself.

The given `for` loop is:
```python
for i in index:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This indicates that the loop will iterate over each element in the `index` variable. For the loop to execute, `index` must be an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or other sequence) that contains at least one element.

Given the initial states:
- `x` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0
- `y` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0
- `z` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0
- `maxNum` is `None`
- `ans` is an empty string

The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `index` is an iterable with at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
**`index` must be an iterable with at least one element**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`index` must be an iterable with at least one element**
