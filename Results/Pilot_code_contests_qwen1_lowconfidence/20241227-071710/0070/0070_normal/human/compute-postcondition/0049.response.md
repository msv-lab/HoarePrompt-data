Postcondition: ***`index` must have at least one element remaining, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the current element in `index`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, and `maxNum` is the first element of `t`. If `maxNum` is `None` or `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`, then `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]` and `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `maxNum` and `ans` remain as they were before the if statement.***
