Postcondition: ***`index` is an iterable with at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `maxNum` is the first element of `t`. If `maxNum` is `None` or the first element of `t` is greater than `maxNum`, then `maxNum` is updated to the first element of `t`. Otherwise, `maxNum` remains unchanged.***
