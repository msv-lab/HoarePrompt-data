The code `maxNum = t[0]` assigns the first element of the tuple `t` to the variable `maxNum`. Since `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, the value of `maxNum` is now the first element of this tuple. However, the exact values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `ans`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the first element of the tuple returned by `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value.**
