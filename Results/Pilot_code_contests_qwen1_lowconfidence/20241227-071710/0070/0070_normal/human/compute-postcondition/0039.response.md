Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `index` is an iterable with at least one element.
   - `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`.
   - If the first element of `t` is not `False`, then:
     - `maxNum` is updated to the maximum value between `maxNum` (initially either `None` or its current value) and the first element of `t`.
     - `ans` is set to the second element of `t`.
   - Otherwise, the values of `maxNum` and `ans` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `index`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `index` must still have at least one element.
   - Since we are moving to the next iteration, `index` will lose one element, but it must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `index` must have at least one element left after removing the current element `i`.
   - `t` will be the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the next element `i` in `index`.
   - Depending on the value of the first element of `t`, `maxNum` and `ans` may change, but since we are just determining the condition for the next iteration, these specific values are not relevant for now.

5. **Final State**:
   - `index` must have at least one element remaining.
   - `t` will be the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the next element in `index`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`index` is an iterable with at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` where `i` is the next element in `index`**.
