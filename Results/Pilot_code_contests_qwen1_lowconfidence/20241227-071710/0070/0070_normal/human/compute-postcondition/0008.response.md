According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `i` from the iterable `index`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another value in the iterable `index`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive)
- `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive)
- `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive)
- `maxNum` is the maximum value between `t[0]` and `maxNum`
- `ans` is the second element of `t` if `t[0] > maxNum`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged
- `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`
- `index` is a non-empty iterable

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` must be available from the iterable `index`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the current `i` has been consumed, and there must be another value in the iterable `index` for the loop to continue.

State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the maximum value between `t[0]` and `maxNum`, `ans` is the second element of `t` if `t[0] > maxNum`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value**
