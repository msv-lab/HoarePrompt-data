To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `index` is an iterable with at least one element.
   - `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`.
   - `ans` is the second element of `t`.
   - `maxNum` is the first element of `t`.
   - If `t[0] != False`, then:
     - If `maxNum` is `None` or `t[0] > maxNum`, `maxNum` is updated to `t[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `maxNum` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `index`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, `index` must have at least one remaining element.

4. **State Adjustments for Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop will execute again only if there is at least one element left in `index`, we need to ensure that `index` still has elements to iterate over.
   - Additionally, the value of `maxNum` may have been updated during the previous iteration, so it should be considered for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `index` must have at least one element remaining.
- `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the next element in `index`.
- `ans` is the second element of `t`.
- `maxNum` is the first element of `t`.

Since we do not know the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, we cannot provide concrete values for `t`, `ans`, and `maxNum`. However, we can state that they will be the return values from `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the next element in `index`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`index` must have at least one element remaining, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the next element in `index`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, and `maxNum` is the first element of `t`.**
