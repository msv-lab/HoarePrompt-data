The code assigns the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)` to the variable `t`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `t[0]` and `t[1]`. However, we know that `t` is the return value of `func_1`, and the previous values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `maxNum`, `ans`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the maximum value between `t[0]` and `maxNum`, `ans` is the second element of `t` if `t[0] > maxNum`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value.

Output State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the maximum value between `t[0]` and `maxNum`, `ans` is the second element of `t` if `t[0] > maxNum`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value.**
