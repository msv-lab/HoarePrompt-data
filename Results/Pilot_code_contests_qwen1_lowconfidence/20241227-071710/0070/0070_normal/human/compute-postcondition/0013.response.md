To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to carefully analyze the conditions under which the loop continues to iterate and how the variables change within each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( x \) is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive).
   - \( y \) is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive).
   - \( z \) is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive).
   - \( \text{maxNum} \) is the maximum value between \( t[0] \) and \( \text{maxNum} \).
   - \( \text{ans} \) is the second element of \( t \) if \( t[0] > \text{maxNum} \), otherwise \( \text{ans} \) remains unchanged.
   - \( t \) is the return value of \( \text{func}_1(x, y, z, i) \).
   - \( \text{index} \) is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each value in \( \text{index} \).
   - For each value of \( i \) in \( \text{index} \), \( t = \text{func}_1(x, y, z, i) \) is computed.
   - If \( t[0] > \text{maxNum} \), then \( \text{maxNum} \) is updated to \( t[0] \) and \( \text{ans} \) is set to the second element of \( t \).

3. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are remaining values in \( \text{index} \).

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are remaining values in \( \text{index} \), the only thing that changes from the previous iteration is the value of \( i \) itself.
   - \( i \) will be the next value in \( \text{index} \).

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) remain unchanged.
   - \( \text{maxNum} \) and \( \text{ans} \) may or may not have changed based on the current value of \( i \) in the previous iteration.
   - \( t \) is recomputed for the new value of \( i \), but its specific values depend on the function \( \text{func}_1 \).
   - \( \text{index} \) loses one value since it is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value.

### Final State:

- \( x \) is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive).
- \( y \) is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive).
- \( z \) is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive).
- \( \text{maxNum} \) is the maximum value between \( t[0] \) and \( \text{maxNum} \).
- \( \text{ans} \) is the second element of \( t \) if \( t[0] > \text{maxNum} \), otherwise \( \text{ans} \) remains unchanged.
- \( t \) is the return value of \( \text{func}_1(x, y, z, i) \), where \( i \) is the next value in \( \text{index} \).
- \( \text{index} \) is a non-empty iterable with at least one value removed (i.e., one fewer value than before).

### Final Answer:

State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the maximum value between `t[0]` and `maxNum`, `ans` is the second element of `t` if `t[0] > maxNum`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value.**

(Note: \( i \) is now the next value in \( \text{index} \).)
