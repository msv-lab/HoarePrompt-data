Output State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the maximum value returned by `func_1(x, y, z, i)` over all iterations, `ans` is the second element of `t` corresponding to the maximum value of `t[0]` if `func_1(x, y, z, i)` is called at least once, otherwise `ans` remains an empty string, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable.**
