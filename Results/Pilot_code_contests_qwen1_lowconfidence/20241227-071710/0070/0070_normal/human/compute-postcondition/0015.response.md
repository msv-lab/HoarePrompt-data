The code assigns the value of `t[1]` to `ans`. Since `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` will now hold the second element of `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the maximum value between `t[0]` and `maxNum`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value.**
