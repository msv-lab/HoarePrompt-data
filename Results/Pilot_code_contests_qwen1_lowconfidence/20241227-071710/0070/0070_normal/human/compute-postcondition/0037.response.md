Postcondition: **`index` is an iterable with at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, the first element of `t` is not False, `maxNum` is updated to the maximum value between `maxNum` (initially either `None` or its current value) and the first element of `t`, and `ans` is the second element of `t`.**
