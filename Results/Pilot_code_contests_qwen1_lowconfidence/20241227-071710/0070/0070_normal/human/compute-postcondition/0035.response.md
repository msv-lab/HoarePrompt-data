`ans` is assigned the value of `t[1]`. The first element of `t` is not False and is greater than `maxNum`, so `maxNum` is updated to this value. The value of `t[1]` is stored in `ans`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `index` is an iterable with at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, the first element of `t` is not False, `maxNum` is equal to the first element of `t`, and `ans` is the second element of `t`.

Output State: **`index` is an iterable with at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, the first element of `t` is not False, `maxNum` is equal to the first element of `t`, `ans` is the second element of `t`**
