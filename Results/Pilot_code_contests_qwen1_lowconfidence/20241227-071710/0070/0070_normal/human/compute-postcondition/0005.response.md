`ans` is assigned the value of `t[1]`. According to the initial state, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and the first element of `t` is greater than `maxNum`. However, the value of `t[1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is less than `t[0]`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, `t[0]` is greater than `maxNum`, `index` is a non-empty iterable**
