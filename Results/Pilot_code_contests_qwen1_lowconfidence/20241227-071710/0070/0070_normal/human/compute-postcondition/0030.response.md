The code initializes `maxNum` to `None` and `ans` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the only changes in the output state are for `maxNum` and `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0, `y` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0, `z` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0, `maxNum` is `None`, `ans` is an empty string**
