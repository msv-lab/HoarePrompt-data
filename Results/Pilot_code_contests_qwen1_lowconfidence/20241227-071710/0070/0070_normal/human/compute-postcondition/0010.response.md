The code `ans = t[1]` assigns the second element of the tuple `t` to the variable `ans`. Since `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, the value of `ans` now reflects the second element of this tuple. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the maximum value between `t[0]` and `maxNum`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value**
