Postcondition: ***`index` is an iterable with at least one element, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, and `maxNum` is the first element of `t`. If `t[0] != False`, then if `maxNum` is `None` or the first element of `t` is greater than `maxNum`, `maxNum` is updated to the first element of `t`. Otherwise, `maxNum` remains unchanged. There is no else part specified, so the postcondition does not change if `t[0] == False`.***
