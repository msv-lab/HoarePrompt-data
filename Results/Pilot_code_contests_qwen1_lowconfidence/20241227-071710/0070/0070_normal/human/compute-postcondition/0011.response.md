The code sets `maxNum` to the value of `t[0]`. Since `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, we know that `maxNum` now holds the first element of this tuple. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `z`, `ans`, and `index`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the first element of `t`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value.**
