The code assigns `t[1]` to `ans`. Since `t` is a tuple containing `maxNum` and `ans`, and `t[1]` refers to the second element of `t`, which is `ans`, this assignment does not change the value of `ans`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`index` must have at least one element remaining, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the current element in `index`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, and `maxNum` is the first element of `t`.**
