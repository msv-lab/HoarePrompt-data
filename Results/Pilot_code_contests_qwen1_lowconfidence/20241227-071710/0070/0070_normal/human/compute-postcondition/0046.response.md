The code `t = func_2(x, y, z, i)` assigns the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` to `t`. The initial state tells us that `t` was previously the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the next element in `index`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, and `maxNum` is the first element of `t`. After executing the code, `t` is reassigned to the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the current element in `index`. The values of `ans` and `maxNum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`index` must have at least one element remaining, `t` is the return value of `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for the current element in `index`, `ans` is the second element of `t`, and `maxNum` is the first element of `t`.**
