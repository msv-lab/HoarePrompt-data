The function `func_3` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`. Each of `x`, `y`, and `z` is a real number such that 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0, and each is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

The function returns:
- Case_1: `ans`, which is the second element of `t` corresponding to the maximum value of `t[0]` if `func_1(x, y, z, i)` is called at least once, otherwise `ans` remains an empty string.
- Case_2: `'x^y^z'`, where x is 1, y and z are real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, and the maximum value among y and z is 1.
- Case_3: `'1^x^z'`, where x and z are real numbers such that 0.1 ≤ x, z ≤ 200.0, and each of x, z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point. The maximum value among x and z is less than 1.
- Case_4: `z` raised to the power of `x` raised to the power of `y`, where z, x, and y are real numbers with one digit after the decimal point, and at least one of them is greater than or equal to 1.
- Case_5: `ans` is the second element of the tuple `t` where `t[0]` is the maximum value among all the first elements of `t` that are not `False`, and `maxNum` remains `None` if no such tuple exists; otherwise, `maxNum` holds the maximum value and `ans` is the corresponding second element.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` with specific constraints and return one of five possible outcomes based on the conditions provided.
