Postcondition: ***`x` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `y` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `z` is between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive), `maxNum` is the maximum value between `t[0]` and `maxNum`, `ans` is the second element of `t` if `t[0] > maxNum`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is the return value of `func_1(x, y, z, i)`, and `index` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining value. If `t[0] > maxNum`, then `maxNum` is set to `t[0]` and `ans` is set to the second element of `t`. Otherwise, `maxNum` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
