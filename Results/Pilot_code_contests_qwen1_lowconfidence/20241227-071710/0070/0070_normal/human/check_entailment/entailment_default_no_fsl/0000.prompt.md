You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:

  1. a1 = xyz; 
  2. a2 = xzy; 
  3. a3 = (xy)z; 
  4. a4 = (xz)y; 
  5. a5 = yxz; 
  6. a6 = yzx; 
  7. a7 = (yx)z; 
  8. a8 = (yz)x; 
  9. a9 = zxy; 
  10. a10 = zyx; 
  11. a11 = (zx)y; 
  12. a12 = (zy)x. 



Let m be the maximum of all the ai, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that ac = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that ac.

Input

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Output

Find the maximum value of expression among xyz, xzy, (xy)z, (xz)y, yxz, yzx, (yx)z, (yz)x, zxy, zyx, (zx)y, (zy)x and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

xyz should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (xy)z should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `k`. These parameters are real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point and lie in the range [0.1, 200.0]. The function returns a mathematical expression based on the value of `k`:

- If `k` is 1, it returns \( x \) raised to the power of \( y \) raised to the power of \( z \), represented as `'x^y^z'`.
- If `k` is 2, it returns \( x \) raised to the power of \( z \) raised to the power of \( y \), represented as `'x^z^y'`.
- If `k` is 3 or 4, it should return \( x \) (the function is incomplete, so it's unclear what the return value is in these cases).
- If `k` is 5, it returns \( y \) raised to the power of \( x \) raised to the power of \( z \), represented as `'y^x^z'`.
- If `k` is 6, it returns \( y \) raised to the power of \( z \) raised to the power of \( x \), represented as `'y^z^x'`.
- If `k` is 7 or 8, it returns \( y \) raised to the power of \( (x * z) \), and a string indicating \((y^x)^z\).
- If `k` is 9, it returns \( z \) raised to the power of \( x \) raised to the power of \( y \), represented as `'z^x^y'`.
- If `k` is 10, it returns \( z \) raised to the power of \( y \) raised to the power of \( x \), represented as `'z^y^x'`.
- If `k` is 11 or 12, it should return \( z \) (the function is incomplete, so it's unclear what the return value is in these cases).

In all other cases where `k` does not match any of the above conditions, the function is also incomplete and unclear about the return value.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `x`, `y`, `z` (real numbers with exactly one digit after the decimal point such that 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0), and `k` (an integer). Based on the value of `k`, the function calculates and returns one of several mathematical expressions involving the natural logarithm (`log`) of the input variables. Specifically:

1. If `x > 1` and `k == 1`, it returns `z * log(y) + log(log(x))` and the string `'x^y^z'`.
2. If `x ≤ 1` and `k == 2`, it returns `y * log(z) + log(log(x))` and the string `'x^z^y'`.
3. If `x > 1` and `k == 3` or `k == 4`, it returns `log(y) + log(z) + log(log(x))` and the string `'(x^y)^z'`.
4. If `y > 1` and `k == 5`, it returns `z * log(x) + log(log(y))` and the string `'y^x^z'`.
5. If `y > 1` and `k == 6`, it returns `x * log(z) + log(log(y))` and the string `'y^z^x'`.
6. If `y > 1` and `k == 7` or `k == 8`, it returns `log(x) + log(z) + log(log(y))` and the string `'(y^x)^z'`.
7. If `z > 1` and `k == 9`, it returns `y * log(x) + log(log(z))` and the string `'z^x^y'`.
8. If `z > 1` and `k == 10`, it returns `x * log(y) + log(log(z))` and the string `'z^y^x'`.
9. If `z > 1` and `k == 11` or `k == 12`, it returns `log(x) + log(y) + log(log(z))` and the string `'(z^x)^y'`.

For all other values of `k`, the function returns `False` and an empty string.

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` with the constraint that 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0 and each has exactly one digit after the decimal point. It returns one of five possible outcomes based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`:

1. If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, it iterates through a given index and calls `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each index value. It keeps track of the maximum value returned by `func_1` and the corresponding second element of the returned tuple. If no valid tuple is found, it returns an empty string.
2. If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is exactly 1:
   - If `x` is 1, it returns 'x^y^z'.
   - If `y` is 1, it returns '1^x^z'.
   - Otherwise, it returns `z^x^y`.
3. If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is greater than 1, it iterates through a given index and calls `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for each index value. It keeps track of the maximum value returned by `func_2` and the corresponding second element of the returned tuple. If no valid tuple is found, it returns an empty string.

In all cases, the function ensures that the constraints on `x`, `y`, and `z` are respected and returns the appropriate result based on the conditions specified.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
