Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, there are issues with the implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` for certain values of `k`.

1. In `func_1`, the cases for `k == 3` and `k == 4` and `k == 11` and `k == 12` are incomplete and return no value. This means that for these cases, the function does not return anything, which violates the requirement to return a mathematical expression for all given cases.

2. In `func_2`, the function handles cases where `x > 1`, `y > 1`, and `z > 1` separately. However, it does not cover the case where `k` does not fall into any of these specific conditions. For example, if `x <= 1`, `y <= 1`, and `z <= 1`, the function will return `False` and an empty string, which is incorrect as per the problem statement.

These issues indicate that the code does not cover all potential cases, leading to incorrect behavior for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
