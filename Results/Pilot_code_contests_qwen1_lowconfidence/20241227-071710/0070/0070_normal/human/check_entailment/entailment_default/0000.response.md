Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is incomplete for certain values of `k` (e.g., `k == 3`, `k == 4`, `k == 11`, and `k == 12`). According to the problem description, Rat Kwesh needs to evaluate all 12 possible expressions and return the one with the maximum value. However, the function `func_1` is not fully implemented for these cases, which means it cannot correctly compute the values for those expressions.

For instance, the function `func_1` does not return anything for `k == 3` and `k == 4`, which corresponds to `(x^y)^z` and `(zx)^y` respectively. Similarly, it does not return anything for `k == 11` and `k == 12`, which correspond to `(zx)^y` and `(zy)^x` respectively. Without proper implementations for these cases, the program cannot guarantee that it will evaluate all 12 expressions and find the maximum value correctly.
