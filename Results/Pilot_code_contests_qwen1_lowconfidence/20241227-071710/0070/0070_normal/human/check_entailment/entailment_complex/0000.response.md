Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the code does not correctly implement the logic for `func_1` and `func_2` for certain values of `k` and input values. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation in `func_1`:**
   - For `k == 3` and `k == 4`, the function returns `x^(z*y)` but it does not return anything meaningful. This is an incomplete implementation and does not adhere to the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate logarithmic expressions based on the value of `k`. However, the implementation is flawed for certain values of `k` and input values. For instance, when `x <= 1` and `k == 2`, the function should return `y * log(z) + log(log(x))`, but it returns `x * log(z) + log(log(y))`, which is incorrect.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```python
(x, y, z) = (0.5, 1.0, 1.5)
```
- For `k == 2`, the expected output should be `1.0 * log(1.5) + log(log(0.5))`, but the current implementation incorrectly calculates `0.5 * log(1.5) + log(log(1.0))`.

Since the code does not handle these cases correctly, the overall program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
