You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Wet Shark asked Rat Kwesh to generate three positive real numbers x, y and z, from 0.1 to 200.0, inclusive. Wet Krash wants to impress Wet Shark, so all generated numbers will have exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Wet Shark knows Rat Kwesh will want a lot of cheese. So he will give the Rat an opportunity to earn a lot of cheese. He will hand the three numbers x, y and z to Rat Kwesh, and Rat Kwesh will pick one of the these twelve options:

  1. a1 = xyz; 
  2. a2 = xzy; 
  3. a3 = (xy)z; 
  4. a4 = (xz)y; 
  5. a5 = yxz; 
  6. a6 = yzx; 
  7. a7 = (yx)z; 
  8. a8 = (yz)x; 
  9. a9 = zxy; 
  10. a10 = zyx; 
  11. a11 = (zx)y; 
  12. a12 = (zy)x. 



Let m be the maximum of all the ai, and c be the smallest index (from 1 to 12) such that ac = m. Rat's goal is to find that c, and he asks you to help him. Rat Kwesh wants to see how much cheese he gets, so he you will have to print the expression corresponding to that ac.

Input

The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point.

Output

Find the maximum value of expression among xyz, xzy, (xy)z, (xz)y, yxz, yzx, (yx)z, (yz)x, zxy, zyx, (zx)y, (zy)x and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list. 

xyz should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (xy)z should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum value among the 12 expressions. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not properly evaluate the expressions and compare their values. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Expressions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not actually compute the values of the expressions. Instead, they use logarithmic approximations which do not accurately represent the actual values of the expressions.

2. **Evaluation of Expressions**: The program needs to compute the actual values of the expressions to determine the maximum. Using logarithms for comparison can lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues and the nature of logarithmic transformations.

3. **Index Handling**: The variable `index` is used in `func_3`, but it is never defined. This suggests a logical error in the code structure.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should directly compute the values of the 12 expressions and compare them to find the maximum. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def evaluate_expression(x, y, z, expr):
    if expr == 1:
        return x ** y ** z
    elif expr == 2:
        return x ** z ** y
    elif expr == 3 or expr == 4:
        return x ** (y * z)
    elif expr == 5:
        return y ** x ** z
    elif expr == 6:
        return y ** z ** x
    elif expr == 7 or expr == 8:
        return y ** (x * z)
    elif expr == 9:
        return z ** x ** y
    elif expr == 10:
        return z ** y ** x
    elif expr == 11 or expr == 12:
        return z ** (x * y)

def find_max_expression(x, y, z):
    max_val = -float('inf')
    max_expr = ''
    for i in range(1, 13):
        val = evaluate_expression(x, y, z, i)
        if val > max_val:
            max_val = val
            max_expr = get_expression(i)
    return max_expr

def get_expression(expr):
    if expr == 1:
        return 'x^y^z'
    elif expr == 2:
        return 'x^z^y'
    elif expr == 3:
        return '(x^y)^z'
    elif expr == 4:
        return '(x^z)^y'
    elif expr == 5:
        return 'y^x^z'
    elif expr == 6:
        return 'y^z^x'
    elif expr == 7:
        return '(y^x)^z'
    elif expr == 8:
        return '(y^z)^x'
    elif expr == 9:
        return 'z^x^y'
    elif expr == 10:
        return 'z^y^x'
    elif expr == 11:
        return '(z^x)^y'
    elif expr == 12:
        return '(z^y)^x'

# Example usage
x, y, z = map(float, input().split())
print(find_max_expression(x, y, z))
```

This corrected program computes the actual values of the expressions and finds the maximum. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts three real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` with the constraint that 0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0 and each has exactly one digit after the decimal point. It returns one of five possible outcomes based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`:

1. If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is less than 1, it iterates through a given index and calls `func_1(x, y, z, i)` for each index value. It keeps track of the maximum value returned by `func_1` and the corresponding second element of the returned tuple. If no valid tuple is found, it returns an empty string.
2. If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is exactly 1:
   - If `x` is 1, it returns 'x^y^z'.
   - If `y` is 1, it returns '1^x^z'.
   - Otherwise, it returns `z^x^y`.
3. If the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z` is greater than 1, it iterates through a given index and calls `func_2(x, y, z, i)` for each index value. It keeps track of the maximum value returned by `func_2` and the corresponding second element of the returned tuple. If no valid tuple is found, it returns an empty string.

In all cases, the function ensures that the constraints on `x`, `y`, and `z` are respected and returns the appropriate result based on the conditions specified.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
