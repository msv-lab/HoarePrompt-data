The function reads the number of watchmen `n` and their coordinates `(xi, yi)` from the input. It then calculates the number of pairs of watchmen that can see each other horizontally and vertically, while also accounting for any watchmen that are positioned at the same coordinates. Specifically, the function:

1. Counts the occurrences of each horizontal and vertical position using dictionaries `rows` and `cols`.
2. Calculates the number of pairs of watchmen for each unique horizontal and vertical position using the formula \((\text{count} - 1) \times \text{count} / 2\).
3. Adjusts the count for positions where multiple watchmen are present, subtracting the overcounted pairs of watchmen that are positioned at the same coordinates.

After processing all watchmen, the function prints the total number of valid pairs of watchmen that can see each other either horizontally or vertically. The function handles the case where watchmen share the same coordinates by adjusting the count of such pairs.
