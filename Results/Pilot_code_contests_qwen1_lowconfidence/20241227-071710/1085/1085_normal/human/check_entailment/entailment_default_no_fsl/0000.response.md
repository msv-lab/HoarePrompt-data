Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The code only counts pairs of watchmen that are aligned horizontally or vertically, but it does not account for diagonal pairs where the distance calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
0 0
1 1
2 2
1 0
```

The correct output should be 3 because there are three pairs with equal Manhattan and Euclidean distances:
1. (0,0) and (2,2)
2. (0,0) and (1,1)
3. (1,1) and (2,2)

However, the provided code would only count the pairs (0,0) and (1,1) and (1,1) and (2,2), resulting in an incorrect output of 2.

To fix this, the code needs to include logic to check for diagonal pairs where \( |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2} \). This can be achieved by iterating through all pairs of watchmen and checking if the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance.
