Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of pairs where the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of pairs for certain configurations of watchmen positions.

Consider the following input:
```
4
0 0
1 0
0 1
1 1
```

For this input, we expect the output to be 6, because there are 6 pairs of watchmen where the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance:

1. (0, 0) and (1, 0): Manhattan distance = |0 - 1| + |0 - 0| = 1, Euclidean distance = sqrt((0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = 1
2. (0, 0) and (0, 1): Manhattan distance = |0 - 0| + |0 - 1| = 1, Euclidean distance = sqrt((0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = 1
3. (0, 0) and (1, 1): Manhattan distance = |0 - 1| + |0 - 1| = 2, Euclidean distance = sqrt((0 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt(2)
4. (1, 0) and (0, 1): Manhattan distance = |1 - 0| + |0 - 1| = 2, Euclidean distance = sqrt((1 - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = sqrt(2)
5. (1, 0) and (1, 1): Manhattan distance = |1 - 1| + |0 - 1| = 1, Euclidean distance = sqrt((1 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2) = 1
6. (0, 1) and (1, 1): Manhattan distance = |0 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 1, Euclidean distance = sqrt((0 - 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2) = 1

However, the program's output is 4 instead of 6. This is because the program incorrectly subtracts pairs that should not be subtracted when calculating the number of valid pairs. The program does not correctly account for the overlap between horizontal and vertical pairs when both coordinates match.

The correct approach would involve a more detailed comparison of each pair's Manhattan and Euclidean distances, which the current implementation does not fully address.
