Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it adheres to the problem specification:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of watchmen `n` and their coordinates `(xi, yi)` as specified. It uses a for loop to read `n` lines, each containing two integers, which matches the problem description.

2. **Distance Calculation**: 
   - Doctor Manhattan's distance calculation is implicitly handled through the problem's requirement to count pairs of watchmen with equal distances according to both definitions.
   - Daniel's distance calculation is not explicitly implemented because the problem does not require computing actual distances but rather counting pairs with equal distances under both definitions.

3. **Counting Pairs**:
   - The program uses three dictionaries: `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` to count the occurrences of each horizontal (`x`), vertical (`y`), and combined (`(x, y)`) position.
   - It calculates the number of pairs for each unique horizontal and vertical position using the formula \((\text{count} - 1) \times \text{count} / 2\). This accounts for the number of pairs formed by identical horizontal or vertical positions.
   - The program adjusts the count for positions where multiple watchmen are present, ensuring no overcounting occurs for watchmen sharing the same coordinates.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - For positions where more than one watchman is present, the program correctly adjusts the count to avoid double-counting. This ensures that the final count reflects the exact number of pairs with equal distances as per the problem requirements.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement without any deviations or oversights. Therefore, the program is correct.
