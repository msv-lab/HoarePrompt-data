Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to count pairs of watchmen that have the same Manhattan and Euclidean distance. Specifically, the code only counts pairs that have the same horizontal or vertical positions but does not consider the diagonal pairs where the Manhattan distance could still match the Euclidean distance.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

Input:
```
4
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
```

Expected output:
```
6
```

This is because there are 6 pairs of watchmen with the same Manhattan and Euclidean distance:
- (0,0) and (0,1)
- (0,0) and (1,0)
- (0,1) and (1,0)
- (0,1) and (1,1)
- (1,0) and (1,1)
- (1,1) and (0,0)

However, the provided code would only count the pairs (0,0) and (0,1), (0,0) and (1,0), and (1,1) and (0,0), resulting in an incorrect output of 3.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
