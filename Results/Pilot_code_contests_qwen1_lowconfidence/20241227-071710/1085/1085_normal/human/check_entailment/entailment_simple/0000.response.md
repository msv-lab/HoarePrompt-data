Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem description:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of watchmen \( n \) and their coordinates \( (x_i, y_i) \).
   - It uses dictionaries to count occurrences of each unique \( x \)-coordinate (`rows`), \( y \)-coordinate (`cols`), and both \( x \)- and \( y \)-coordinates together (`posi`).

2. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each unique \( x \)-coordinate, the program calculates the number of pairs using the combination formula \(\frac{(rows[t] - 1) \times rows[t]}{2}\).
   - Similarly, for each unique \( y \)-coordinate, it does the same.
   - Additionally, it adjusts for cases where a specific \( (x, y) \)-pair appears more than once by subtracting the appropriate combinations from the total count.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The program sums up all the pairs from the \( x \)-coordinates, \( y \)-coordinates, and the unique \( (x, y) \)-pairs to get the final answer.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final count of pairs.

### Why the Program Follows the Problem Description:

- **Doctor Manhattan's Distance:** The problem defines the distance between watchmen \(i\) and \(j\) as \( |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| \). The program does not directly use this formula but instead counts pairs based on the number of occurrences of each coordinate.
- **Daniel's Distance:** The distance calculated by Daniel would be the Euclidean distance, which is not directly relevant here because the program is counting pairs based on the Manhattan distance.
- **Pairs with Equal Distances:** The program correctly counts the number of pairs of watchmen for which the Manhattan distance is the same. This is achieved by leveraging the frequency of each coordinate and the adjustments for multiple occurrences of the same \( (x, y) \)-pair.

Given that the program correctly counts the number of pairs where the Manhattan distance matches the Euclidean distance (by default, due to the nature of the problem), it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
