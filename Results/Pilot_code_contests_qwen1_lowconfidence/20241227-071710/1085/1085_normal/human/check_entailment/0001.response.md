Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. The program only considers pairs based on the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and subtracts overlapping pairs, which does not account for all possible pairs that could have the same distance according to both methods.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```

According to the problem description, the correct answer should be 6, as there are 6 pairs where the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance:

- (1,1) and (1,2)
- (1,1) and (2,1)
- (1,2) and (2,2)
- (2,1) and (2,2)

However, the provided program will incorrectly count only 4 pairs because it does not properly handle the overlapping cases and the specific conditions required for the Manhattan and Euclidean distances to be equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
