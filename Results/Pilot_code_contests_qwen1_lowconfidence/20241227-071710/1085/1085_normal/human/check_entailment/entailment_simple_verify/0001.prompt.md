You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Watchmen are in a danger and Doctor Manhattan together with his friend Daniel Dreiberg should warn them as soon as possible. There are n watchmen on a plane, the i-th watchman is located at point (xi, yi).

They need to arrange a plan, but there are some difficulties on their way. As you know, Doctor Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen i and j to be |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|. Daniel, as an ordinary person, calculates the distance using the formula <image>.

The success of the operation relies on the number of pairs (i, j) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that the distance between watchman i and watchmen j calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between them calculated by Daniel. You were asked to compute the number of such pairs.

Input

The first line of the input contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of watchmen.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109).

Some positions may coincide.

Output

Print the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel.

Examples

Input

6
0 0
0 1
0 2
-1 1
0 1
1 1


Output

11

Note

In the first sample, the distance between watchman 1 and watchman 2 is equal to |1 - 7| + |1 - 5| = 10 for Doctor Manhattan and <image> for Daniel. For pairs (1, 1), (1, 5) and (7, 5), (1, 5) Doctor Manhattan and Daniel will calculate the same distances.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    rows = {}
    cols = {}
    posi = {}
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = [int(t) for t in raw_input().split(' ')]
        if x in rows:
            rows[x] += 1
        else:
            rows[x] = 1
        if y in cols:
            cols[y] += 1
        else:
            cols[y] = 1
        if (x, y) in posi:
            posi[x, y] += 1
        else:
            posi[x, y] = 1
    ans = 0
    for t in rows.keys():
        ans = ans + (rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2
    for t in cols.keys():
        ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2
    for t in posi.keys():
        if posi[t] > 1:
            ans -= (posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel. The program only considers pairs based on the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and subtracts overlapping pairs, which does not account for all possible pairs that could have the same distance according to both methods.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```

According to the problem description, the correct answer should be 6, as there are 6 pairs where the Manhattan distance equals the Euclidean distance:

- (1,1) and (1,2)
- (1,1) and (2,1)
- (1,2) and (2,2)
- (2,1) and (2,2)

However, the provided program will incorrectly count only 4 pairs because it does not properly handle the overlapping cases and the specific conditions required for the Manhattan and Euclidean distances to be equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of the number of watchmen n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) followed by n lines, each containing two integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109) representing the coordinates of the i-th watchman. Some positions may coincide.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `rows` is a dictionary where each key `x` maps to the number of times `x` appeared as the first coordinate, `cols` is a dictionary where each key `y` maps to the number of times `y` appeared as the second coordinate, `posi` is a dictionary where each key `(x, y)` maps to the number of times `(x, y)` appeared.
    ans = 0
    for t in rows.keys():
        ans = ans + (rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the sum of \((\text{rows}[t] - 1) \times \text{rows}[t] / 2\) for all unique keys \(t\) in `rows`, `rows` is unchanged, `cols` is unchanged, and `posi` is unchanged.
    for t in cols.keys():
        ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the sum of \((\text{cols}[t] - 1) \times \text{cols}[t] / 2\) for all unique keys \(t\) in `cols`, `rows` remains unchanged, `cols` remains unchanged, `posi` remains unchanged.
    for t in posi.keys():
        if posi[t] > 1:
            ans -= (posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the final value of `ans` after applying the adjustment for each key `t` in `posi.keys()` where `posi[t] > 1`, and `posi` is a dictionary where the value of each key `t` is decremented by 1 for every iteration where `posi[t] > 1`. If no iterations occur (i.e., all values in `posi` are initially <= 1), then `ans` remains unchanged and `posi` remains as the initial state.
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
