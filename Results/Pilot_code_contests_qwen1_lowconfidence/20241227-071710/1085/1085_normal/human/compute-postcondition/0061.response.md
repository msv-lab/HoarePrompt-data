The initial state is defined such that `ans` is the sum of \((\text{cols}[t] - 1) \times \text{cols}[t] / 2\) for all unique keys \(t\) in `cols`, and `posi[t]` is greater than 1 for at least one key \(t\).

The code snippet `ans -= (posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2` subtracts the value \((\text{posi}[t] - 1) \times \text{posi}[t] / 2\) from `ans`.

Since the exact value of `posi[t]` is not specified, let's denote it as `k` where \(k > 1\). The expression \((\text{posi}[t] - 1) \times \text{posi}[t] / 2\) becomes \((k - 1) \times k / 2\).

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` minus \((k - 1) \times k / 2\).

The output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is the sum of \((\text{cols}[t] - 1) \times \text{cols}[t] / 2\) for all unique keys \(t\) in `cols` minus \((\text{posi}[t] - 1) \times \text{posi}[t] / 2` for the specific key \(t\); `posi[t]` is greater than 1**.
