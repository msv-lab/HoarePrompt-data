Let's break down the given information step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `ans` is the sum of \((\text{cols}[t] - 1) \times \text{cols}[t] / 2\) for all unique keys \(t\) in `cols`.
- `rows` remains unchanged.
- `cols` remains unchanged.
- `posi` remains unchanged.

### The For Loop:
```python
for t in posi.keys():
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is initialized as the sum of \((\text{cols}[t] - 1) \times \text{cols}[t] / 2\) for all unique keys \(t\) in `cols`. This means `ans` already has a value based on the initial values of `cols`.

2. **Key in `posi`:**
   - The loop iterates over the keys in `posi`. Therefore, `posi` must have at least one key for the loop to execute.

3. **Unchanged Variables:**
   - `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` remain unchanged throughout the loop. The loop itself does not change these variables.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `posi` has at least one key. Since `ans` is pre-computed based on `cols` and remains unchanged, no adjustments are needed for `ans`. Similarly, since `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` remain unchanged, no adjustments are needed for these either.

### Final State:
State: **`ans` is the sum of \((\text{cols}[t] - 1) \times \text{cols}[t] / 2\) for all unique keys \(t\) in `cols`, `posi` must have at least one key.**

This ensures that the loop can execute because there is at least one key in `posi` to iterate over.
