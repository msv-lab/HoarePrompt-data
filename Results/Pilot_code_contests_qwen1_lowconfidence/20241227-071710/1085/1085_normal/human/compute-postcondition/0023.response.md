The code `rows[x] += 1` increments the value of `rows[x]` by 1. Since `x` is `a` from the initial state, this means `rows[a]` is incremented by 1. 

From the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `rows` is updated with the value 1 if `x` (which is `a`) does not exist, otherwise `x` (which is `a`) is incremented by 1.
- `cols` is updated with the value 1 if `y` (which is `b`) does not exist, otherwise `y` (which is `b`) is incremented by 1.
- `posi` is updated with the value 1 if `(x, y)` (which is `(a, b)`) does not exist, otherwise `(x, y)` (which is `(a, b)`) is incremented by 1.

Since `rows[a]` is incremented by 1, the value of `rows[a]` is now 2 (assuming it was initially 1).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is 2, `cols` is updated with the value 1 if `y` (which is `b`) does not exist, otherwise `y` (which is `b`) is incremented by 1, `posi` is updated with the value 1 if `(x, y)` (which is `(a, b)`) does not exist, otherwise `(x, y)` (which is `(a, b)`) is incremented by 1**.
