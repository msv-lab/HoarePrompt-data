The code `cols[y] += 1` increments the value of `cols[y]` by 1. Since the initial state of `cols[b]` is 1, and no information about `y` is given, we assume `y` is equal to `b` (since `b` is the only value provided for `cols` initially).

Therefore, `cols[b]` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2, `cols[b]` is 2, `posi[a, b]` is 1, `a` is incremented by 1 if `x` (which is `a`) does not exist in `rows`, otherwise `rows[a]` is 2 and `cols` and `posi` are updated as per the else part.**
