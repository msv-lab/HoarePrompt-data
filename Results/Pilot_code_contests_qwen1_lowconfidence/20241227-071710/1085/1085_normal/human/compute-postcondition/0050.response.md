The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `(rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2`. Given the initial state, `ans` is already calculated as \((\text{rows}[t'] - 1) \times \frac{\text{rows}[t']}{2} + (\text{rows}[t'] - 1) \times \frac{\text{rows}[t']}{2}\), and `rows` remains unchanged. The variable `t` is set to the next key in the `rows` dictionary.

Let's denote the value of `rows[t']` as `r`. Then, the initial value of `ans` is \(2 \times \frac{(r - 1) \times r}{2} = (r - 1) \times r\).

After executing the code snippet, `ans` is updated to:
\[ \text{ans} = (r - 1) \times r + (r - 1) \times r / 2 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \text{ans} = (r - 1) \times r + \frac{(r - 1) \times r}{2} = \frac{2 \times (r - 1) \times r + (r - 1) \times r}{2} = \frac{3 \times (r - 1) \times r}{2} \]

The variable `rows` remains unchanged, and `t` is now set to the next key in the `rows` dictionary.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`ans` is \(\frac{3 \times (r - 1) \times r}{2}\); `rows` is unchanged; `t` is the next key in the `rows` dictionary.**
