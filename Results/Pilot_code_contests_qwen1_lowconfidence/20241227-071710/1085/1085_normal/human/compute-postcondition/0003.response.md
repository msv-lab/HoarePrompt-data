The code `posi = {}` creates an empty dictionary named `posi`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `rows`, or `cols`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `posi` dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the input, `rows` is an empty dictionary, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `posi` is an empty dictionary.**
