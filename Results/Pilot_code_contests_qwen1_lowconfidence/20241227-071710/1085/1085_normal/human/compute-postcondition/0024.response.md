The code snippet `rows[x] = 1` assigns the value 1 to `rows[x]`. Given the initial conditions, if `x` (which is `a`) exists, it is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is set to 1. Since `rows[x]` is being updated, `x` (which is `a`) must exist, and therefore, it is incremented by 1. The other variables (`cols`, `posi`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is 1, `cols[b]` is 1, `posi[a, b]` is 1, `a` is incremented by 1**
