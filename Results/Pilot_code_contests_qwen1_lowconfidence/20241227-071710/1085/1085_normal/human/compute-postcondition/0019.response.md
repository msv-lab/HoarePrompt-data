`posi` is updated to include the key `(x, y)` with the value 1. Since `(x, y)` was not previously in `posi`, it is added. The other variables (`n`, `rows`, `cols`, `x`, `y`, and the condition for `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a dictionary where `x` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists or added with the value 1 if it does not, `cols` is a dictionary, `posi` is a dictionary containing the key `(x, y)` with the value 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `(x, y)` is now in `posi`.**
