The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function definition. Instead, it appears to read input from some external source, which is not shown here. Based on the description, the function processes a series of coordinates representing the positions of watchmen.

Output:
- Case_1: The function reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) representing the number of watchmen.
- Case_2: For each of the next `n` lines, the function reads two integers `xi` and `yi` (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109) representing the coordinates of the i-th watchman.
- Case_3: The function does not return anything explicitly, but it processes the coordinates of the watchmen.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read the number of watchmen and their coordinates from the input and process them accordingly.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of watchmen `n` and their coordinates `(xi, yi)` from the input and processes them.**
