The given code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the value `(rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2` to its current value. However, the initial values of `ans` and `rows[t]` are not provided in the initial state. Since the initial values are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. But we know that `ans` has been updated by adding the specified expression to its current value.

Output State: **`ans` is its initial value plus (rows[t] - 1) * rows[t] / 2, `rows` is unchanged**
