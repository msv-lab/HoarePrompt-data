The code snippet `ans -= (posi[t] - 1) * posi[t] / 2` impacts the variable `ans` by subtracting the value of \((\text{posi}[t] - 1) \times \text{posi}[t] / 2\) from `ans`. The value of `t` is the current key being processed from `posi.keys()`. Since the initial state of `ans` is defined as the sum of \((\text{cols}[t] - 1) \times \text{cols}[t] / 2\) for all unique keys \(t\) in `cols`, adjusted by subtracting \((\text{posi}[t] - 1) \times \text{posi}[t] / 2\) for the specific key `t` if \(\text{posi}[t] > 1\), and the next key `t` from `posi.keys()` is being processed, the impact of this operation is to further adjust `ans` by subtracting \((\text{posi}[t] - 1) \times \text{posi}[t] / 2\) from its current value.

The other variables, `cols` and `posi`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is adjusted by subtracting (\(\text{posi}[t] - 1\) \(\times\) \(\text{posi}[t]\) / 2) for the current key `t` from `posi.keys()`, `cols` and `posi` remain unchanged.**
