The code snippet takes two integers as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified, they will be assigned the values entered by the user. However, the initial values of `n` and `rows[a]` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is also not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered by the user, `y` is the second integer entered by the user**
