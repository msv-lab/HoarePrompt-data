The code updates the variable `ans` by adding `(cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2` to its current value. Given that `cols[t]` is a value from the dictionary `cols`, and the other variables (`rows`, `posi`, `t`) remain unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is updated to include the next term based on the new value of `t` (specifically, `ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2`), `rows` remains unchanged, `cols` remains unchanged, `posi` remains unchanged, and `t` will be the next key from the `cols` dictionary.**
