The code `cols[y] += 1` increments the value of `cols[y]` by 1. The value of `y` is the second integer entered by the user, so `cols[y]` will be incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered by the user, `y` is the second integer entered by the user, `cols[y]` is incremented by 1.**
