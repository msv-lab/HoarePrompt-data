The code snippet `cols = {}` creates an empty dictionary named `cols`. This operation does not affect the value of `n` or the contents of the `rows` dictionary. Therefore, the output state includes the updated dictionary `cols` and retains the initial state of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the input, the input consists of the number of watchmen n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) followed by n lines, each containing two integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109) representing the coordinates of the i-th watchman; `rows` is an empty dictionary; `cols` is an empty dictionary.**
