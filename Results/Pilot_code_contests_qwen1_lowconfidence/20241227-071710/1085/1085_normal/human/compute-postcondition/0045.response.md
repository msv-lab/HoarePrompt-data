To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the condition under which the loop runs. The loop iterates over the keys of the `rows` dictionary. For the loop to execute, the `rows` dictionary must contain at least one key.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments step by step:

1. **Check if `rows` contains at least one key**: The loop can only execute if there is at least one key in the `rows` dictionary. If `rows` is empty, the loop will not execute.

2. **Adjust the initial state**: The initial state of `rows` must be such that it contains at least one key. Therefore, we need to adjust `rows` to have at least one key-value pair.

3. **Initial values of other variables**: The values of `n`, `cols`, `posi`, and `ans` do not affect whether the loop can execute, but they remain as given in the initial state.

Based on this analysis, the required adjustment is to ensure that the `rows` dictionary has at least one key.

**State:**
**`n` is a positive integer, `rows` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `cols` is a dictionary where each key `y` maps to the number of times `y` appeared as the second coordinate, `posi` is a dictionary where each key `(x, y)` maps to the number of times `(x, y)` appeared; `ans` is 0.**
