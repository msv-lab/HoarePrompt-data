`rows[x]` is assigned the value 1. The value of `x` is determined by the first integer entered by the user. Therefore, `rows[x]` is now 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered by the user, `y` is the second integer entered by the user; `rows[x]` is 1**
