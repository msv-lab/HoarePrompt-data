`x` is an integer that was present in the `rows` dictionary. The code `rows[x] += 1` increments the value of `rows[x]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `posi` is an empty dictionary, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer**
