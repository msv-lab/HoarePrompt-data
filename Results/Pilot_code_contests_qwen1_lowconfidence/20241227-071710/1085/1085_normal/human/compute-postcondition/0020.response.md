Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a dictionary where `x` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists or added with the value 1 if it does not, `cols` is a dictionary where `y` is incremented by 1 if it already exists or added with the value 1 if it does not, `posi` is a dictionary containing the key `(x, y)` with the value 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `posi` is updated with the key-value pair `(x, y): 1`.***
