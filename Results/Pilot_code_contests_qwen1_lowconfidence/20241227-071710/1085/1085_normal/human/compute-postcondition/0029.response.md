Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2, `posi[x, y]` is incremented by 1, `cols` and `posi` are updated based on the conditions. If `y` is in `cols`, `a` is incremented by 1 if `x` (which is `a`) does not exist in `rows`, otherwise `rows[a]` is set to 2 and `cols` and `posi` are updated as per the else part. If `y` is not in `cols`, `rows[a]` is set to 2 and `cols[y]` and `posi[a, y]` are updated.**
