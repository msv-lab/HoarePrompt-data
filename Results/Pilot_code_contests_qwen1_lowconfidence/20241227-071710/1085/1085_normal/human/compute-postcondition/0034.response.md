`rows[x]` is incremented by 1. Since `x` is the first integer entered by the user and `rows[x]` can be either 1 or 2, after incrementing, `rows[x]` will be either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1; `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 1; `x` is the first integer entered by the user; `y` is the second integer entered by the user; `rows[x]` is either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2; `i` is 1; `x` is the first integer entered by the user; `y` is the second integer entered by the user; `rows[x]` is either 2 or 3**
