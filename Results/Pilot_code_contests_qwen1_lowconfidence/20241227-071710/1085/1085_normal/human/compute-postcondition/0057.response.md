The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2` to its current value. The values of `rows`, `cols`, `posi`, and `t` remain unchanged. Since the exact values of these variables are not provided, we can express the changes in terms of their previous values.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to include the next term based on the new value of `t` (specifically, `ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2`), `rows` remains unchanged, `cols` remains unchanged, `posi` remains unchanged, and `t` is the next key in the `cols` dictionary.**
