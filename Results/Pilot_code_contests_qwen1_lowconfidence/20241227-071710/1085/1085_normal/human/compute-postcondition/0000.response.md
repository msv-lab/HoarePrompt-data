The code `n = int(raw_input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of watchmen, and it is read after the initial state description which mentions that the input consists of the number of watchmen `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `xi` and `yi` (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109) representing the coordinates of the i-th watchman.

After executing this line of code, the value of `n` is set to the integer read from the input, and the subsequent lines of input are yet to be processed. However, since the code only updates the value of `n` and does not affect any other variables or the structure of the input data, the other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is the integer read from the input, the input consists of the number of watchmen n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) followed by n lines, each containing two integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109) representing the coordinates of the i-th watchman.**
