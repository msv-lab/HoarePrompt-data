The code `posi[x, y] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `(x, y)` in the dictionary `posi` by 1. Given that `(x, y)` is already a key in `posi`, its value will be incremented. No other changes are made to the variables or dictionaries.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a dictionary where `x` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists or added with the value 1 if it does not, `cols` is a dictionary, `posi` is a dictionary where the value of the key `(x, y)` is incremented by 1, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If `y` is in `cols`, `cols[y]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cols` is updated with the key-value pair `y: 1`.**
