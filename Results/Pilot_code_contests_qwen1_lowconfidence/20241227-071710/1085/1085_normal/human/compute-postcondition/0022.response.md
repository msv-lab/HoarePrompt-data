The code `x, y = [int(t) for t in raw_input().split(' ')]` reads two integers from input, splits them by space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means `x` and `y` will be assigned specific integer values from the input.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `rows` is a dictionary where `x` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists or added with the value 1 if it does not
- `cols` is a dictionary where `y` is incremented by 1 if it already exists or added with the value 1 if it does not
- `posi` is a dictionary containing the key `(x, y)` with the value 1, and if `(x, y)` is in `posi`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `posi` is updated with the key-value pair `(x, y): 1`

After the code runs, `x` and `y` will hold the integer values inputted by the user. The dictionaries `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` will be updated based on these new values.

Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the input, let's denote the input integers as `a` and `b` respectively. So, `x` will be `a` and `y` will be `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `rows` is updated: if `a` already exists, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `a` is added with the value 1
- `cols` is updated: if `b` already exists, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `b` is added with the value 1
- `posi` is updated: if `(a, b)` already exists, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `(a, b)` is added with the value 1

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows` is updated with the value 1 if `x` (which is `a`) does not exist, otherwise `x` (which is `a`) is incremented by 1, `cols` is updated with the value 1 if `y` (which is `b`) does not exist, otherwise `y` (which is `b`) is incremented by 1, `posi` is updated with the value 1 if `(x, y)` (which is `(a, b)`) does not exist, otherwise `(x, y)` (which is `(a, b)`) is incremented by 1**.
