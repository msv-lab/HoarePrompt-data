The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2`. The value of `cols[t]` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `cols[t]`. The other variables (`ans`, `rows`, `cols`, and `posi`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so they remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2`, `rows` remains unchanged, `cols` remains unchanged, `posi` remains unchanged.**
