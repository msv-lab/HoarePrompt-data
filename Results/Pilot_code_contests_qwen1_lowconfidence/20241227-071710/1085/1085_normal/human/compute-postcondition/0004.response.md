According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we know that `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` are all empty dictionaries. These states do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is an empty dictionary, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `posi` is an empty dictionary**
