`cols[y]` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `y` is determined by the second integer entered by the user, but its specific value is not known from the initial state. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered by the user, `y` is the second integer entered by the user, and `cols[y]` is `1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered by the user, `y` is the second integer entered by the user, `cols[y]` is 1**
