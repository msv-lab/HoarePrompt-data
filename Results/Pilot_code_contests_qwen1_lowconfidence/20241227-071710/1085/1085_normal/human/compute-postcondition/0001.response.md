The given code initializes an empty dictionary called `rows`. This does not assign any new values to existing variables but rather creates a new variable. The initial state remains unchanged except for the creation of the `rows` dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the input, the input consists of the number of watchmen n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) followed by n lines, each containing two integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109) representing the coordinates of the i-th watchman; `rows` is an empty dictionary.**
