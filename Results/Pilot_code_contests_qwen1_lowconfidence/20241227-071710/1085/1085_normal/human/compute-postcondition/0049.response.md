Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is its initial value plus \((\text{rows}[t] - 1) \times \frac{\text{rows}[t]}{2} + (\text{rows}[t] - 1) \times \frac{\text{rows}[t]}{2}\).
   - `rows` is unchanged.
   - `t` is set to the next key in the `rows` dictionary.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `rows.keys()`.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must be a valid key in `rows`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `rows` is unchanged, it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ans` is updated based on the current value of `t`.
   - `t` is set to the next key in `rows`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the next key in `rows` after `t`.
   - `ans` will be updated using the new value of `t`.
   - `t` will be set to the next key in `rows`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- **`ans`**: It will be updated based on the next key `t` in `rows`.
- **`rows`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`t`**: Will be set to the next key in `rows`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`ans` is its initial value plus \((\text{rows}[t'] - 1) \times \frac{\text{rows}[t']}{2} + (\text{rows}[t'] - 1) \times \frac{\text{rows}[t']}{2}\), `rows` is unchanged, and `t` is set to the next key in the `rows` dictionary, where `t'` is the next key after the previous `t`.**
