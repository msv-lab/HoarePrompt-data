Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2. If `(x, y)` is in `posi`, then `posi[x, y]` is incremented by 1, and `cols` and `posi` are updated based on the conditions. If `(x, y)` is not in `posi`, then `posi[x, y]` is set to 1, and `cols` and `posi` are updated accordingly.***
