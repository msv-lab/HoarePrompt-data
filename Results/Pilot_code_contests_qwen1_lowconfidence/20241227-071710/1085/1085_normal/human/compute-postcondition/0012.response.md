`cols[y]` is incremented by 1. Since `y` is a key in `cols`, this means the value associated with `y` in `cols` will be increased by 1. The other variables (`n`, `rows`, `posi`, `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a dictionary where `x` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists or added with the value 1 if it does not, `cols` is a dictionary with `y` as a key, `posi` is an empty dictionary, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `cols[y]` is incremented by 1.**
