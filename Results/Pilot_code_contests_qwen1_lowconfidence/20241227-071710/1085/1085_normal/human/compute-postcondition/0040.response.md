`posi[x, y]` is assigned the value `posi[x, y] + 1`. Since `x` is the first integer entered by the user and `y` is the second integer entered by the user, `posi[x, y]` will now be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `rows[a]` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered by the user, `y` is the second integer entered by the user, `posi[x, y]` is incremented by 1**
