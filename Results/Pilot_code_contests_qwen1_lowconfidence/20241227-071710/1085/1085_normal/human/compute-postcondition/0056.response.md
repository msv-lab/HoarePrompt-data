According to the code, the loop iterates over the keys of the `cols` dictionary. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `ans` is updated to include the next term based on the new value of `t` (specifically, `ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2`).
- `rows` remains unchanged.
- `cols` remains unchanged.
- `posi` remains unchanged.
- `t` will be the next key from the `cols` dictionary.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be the next key in the `cols` dictionary. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is now the next key in the `cols` dictionary.

State: **`ans` is updated to include the next term based on the new value of `t` (specifically, `ans = ans + (cols[t] - 1) * cols[t] / 2`), `rows` remains unchanged, `cols` remains unchanged, `posi` remains unchanged, and `t` is the next key in the `cols` dictionary.**
