`rows[x]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `x` was not in `rows` initially, it now contains the key-value pair `x: 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a dictionary with the entry `x: 1`, `cols` is an empty dictionary, `posi` is an empty dictionary, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `x` is not in `cols` and `posi`**
