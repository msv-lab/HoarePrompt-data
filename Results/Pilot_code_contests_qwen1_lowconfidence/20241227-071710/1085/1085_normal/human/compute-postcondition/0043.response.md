Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `rows` is a dictionary where each key `x` maps to the number of times `x` appeared as the first coordinate, `cols` is a dictionary where each key `y` maps to the number of times `y` appeared as the second coordinate, `posi` is a dictionary where each key `(x, y)` maps to the number of times `(x, y)` appeared.**

Explanation:
- After the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, `rows` will contain the count of each unique `x` value that was entered.
- Similarly, `cols` will contain the count of each unique `y` value that was entered.
- `posi` will contain the count of each unique `(x, y)` pair that was entered.

This output state encapsulates the final values of the variables `rows`, `cols`, and `posi` after the loop has completed its execution.
