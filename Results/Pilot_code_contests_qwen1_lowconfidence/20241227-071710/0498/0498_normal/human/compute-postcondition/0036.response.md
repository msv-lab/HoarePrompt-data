The code `print('NO')` does not affect any variable's value; it only prints 'NO' to the console. The variables `out`, `mem`, `mem2`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `labels[x][y]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `labels[x][y]` is `i + 1`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
