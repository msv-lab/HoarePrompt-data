To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can continue. The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the list `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`.
   - `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists with an additional entry `mem2[y - x]` containing the list `[x, y]`.
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `a` must contain at least one tuple.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are tuples in `a` to iterate over.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - The loop has just completed one iteration, meaning one tuple `(x, y)` from `a` has been processed.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must still contain at least one tuple to iterate over.
   - Therefore, `a` must now have at least one tuple left.

### Adjusted States:

- `n` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
- `mem` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `mem2` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `out` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `a` must now contain at least one tuple, but specifically, it should have at least one tuple left to process in the next iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists with an additional entry `mem2[y - x]` containing the list `[x, y]`, `out` is an empty list, `a` must contain at least one tuple to process in the next iteration**
