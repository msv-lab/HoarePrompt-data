According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are items in the `Counter` object `mem`. The `Counter` object `mem` is created from the list `w`, and its keys are elements from `w`, and the values are their counts. Therefore, the loop will execute if `mem` has at least one item.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`n`**: While `n` is important, it does not directly affect whether the loop will execute based on the given information. `n` is a constraint on the size of the list `w`, but we don't need to adjust `n` specifically because the loop will run based on the contents of `mem`.

2. **`mem`**: The loop will execute if `mem` has at least one item. This means `mem` should not be empty.

3. **`out`**: The state of `out` is not relevant to whether the loop will execute, since the loop body is omitted.

4. **`a`**: Since `a` is used in creating `mem2`, but not directly in the loop, it doesn't affect the loop's execution directly. However, it ensures that `mem2` is populated correctly.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `mem` is not empty for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`total` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` must have at least one item, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) corresponding to tuples \((x, y)\) from `a`, `out` is an empty list, `a` must be an iterable containing tuples \((x, y)\) for the loop to execute at least once.** 

However, focusing on what is essential for the loop to execute:

**State:**
**`mem` must have at least one item**
