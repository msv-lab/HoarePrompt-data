The code `x, y = mem2[w[i]][-1]` impacts the program by assigning the last pair from the list associated with the key \(w[i] - x\) in `mem2` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given the initial state:

- `out` is an empty list
- `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\)
- `n` must be greater than 0

After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\), `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`**
