The print statement 'NO' does not affect any variables but outputs 'NO' to the console. The values of `mem2[i]` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`; printed output is 'NO'.
Output State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`; printed output is 'NO'**
