The code updates the `labels` dictionary at the position `[x][y]` to the value `i + 1`. Given that the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can represent the updated value as `i + 1`.

- `out` remains an empty list plus the popped pair as a string.
- `mem` remains a Counter object of the list `w`.
- `mem2` remains a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` remain the first and second elements of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`.
- The condition for printing 'NO' remains not checked as the code does not modify `labels` directly.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `labels[x][y]` is `i + 1`.**
