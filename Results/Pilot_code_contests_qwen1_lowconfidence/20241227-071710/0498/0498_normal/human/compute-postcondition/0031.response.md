Postcondition: ***`out` is an empty list, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\), `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `labels[x][y] = i + 1`. If the condition `(i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y])` is true, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
