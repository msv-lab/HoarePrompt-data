The code snippet `print('YES')` prints the string 'YES' to the console. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The list `out`, the dictionary `mem2`, the list `w`, and the matrix `labels` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is a list containing `n` strings, each representing a pair \([x, y]\) that was popped from `mem2[w[i]]`, `mem2[w[i]]` is empty for all `i`, `labels` is updated such that for each pair \([x, y]\) that was popped, `labels[x][y]` is the index of the pair in the sequence, and `n` is the length of the list `w`. A string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
