The code `mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)` sorts the string `mem2[i]` in reverse order. Since strings in Python are immutable, sorting the string does not return a new string but sorts the string in place. This means the string `mem2[i]` itself is modified.

The states of the other variables (`j` and the condition checking the length of `mem2[i]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`mem2[i]` is sorted in reverse order, `j` is an integer**
