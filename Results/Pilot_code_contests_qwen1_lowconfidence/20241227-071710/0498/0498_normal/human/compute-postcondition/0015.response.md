The code `print('NO')` simply prints 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `mem2[i]` or `j`. The printed output being 'NO' is a side effect of the print statement but does not change the state of the variables.

Output State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer**
