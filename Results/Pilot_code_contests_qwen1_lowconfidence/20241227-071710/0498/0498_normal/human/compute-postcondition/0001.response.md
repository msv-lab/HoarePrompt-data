According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop will iterate over each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists
- `out` is an empty list

We need to ensure that `a` contains at least one tuple for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to include this condition.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists, `out` is an empty list, `a` must contain at least one tuple**
