According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and the dictionary `mem`. The loop iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `mem`, where `i` is the key and `j` is the value.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `mem2[i]` is a string.
- `j` is an integer.
- The printed output is 'NO' if the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be true:
- There must be another key-value pair in the dictionary `mem`.
- `i` should be the key of the next pair.
- `j` should be the integer value corresponding to that key.

Given these conditions, let's assume there is another key-value pair in the dictionary `mem` and denote it as `(i+1, j+1)` (assuming the keys and values increase sequentially for simplicity).

State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, the printed output is 'NO' if the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`, and there exists another key-value pair in the dictionary `mem` with `i` incremented by 1 and `j` incremented by 1.** 

In a more specific format:
State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, the printed output is 'NO' if the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`, and the next key-value pair in `mem` is `(i+1, j+1)`.**
