The code `mem2[y - x].append([x, y])` appends the list `[x, y]` to the existing list in `mem2[y - x]`. Given that `mem2[y - x]` already contains `[x, y]`, this line of code adds another instance of `[x, y]` to the same list.

Since the initial state does not specify exact values for `x` and `y`, the updated state will show that the list `mem2[y - x]` now contains two instances of `[x, y]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists with an additional entry `mem2[y - x]` containing the list `[x, y, [x, y]]`, `out` is an empty list, `a` contains at least one tuple to process**
