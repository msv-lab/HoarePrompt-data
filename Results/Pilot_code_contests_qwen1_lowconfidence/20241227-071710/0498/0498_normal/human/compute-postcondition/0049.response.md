The code `print('\n'.join(out))` does not change any of the variables' values. It joins all the elements in the list `out` with a newline character `\n` and prints the resulting string to the console. However, since no new values are assigned to any of the variables (`out`, `mem2`, `w`, or `labels`), their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is a list containing `n` strings, each representing a pair \([x, y]\) that was popped from `mem2[w[i]]`, `mem2[w[i]]` is empty for all `i`, `labels` is updated such that for each pair \([x, y]\) that was popped, `labels[x][y]` is the index of the pair in the sequence, and `n` is the length of the list `w`. The string 'YES' is printed to the console.**
