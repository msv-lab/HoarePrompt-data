The code `print('NO')` prints 'NO', but does not affect the values of `mem2[i]` or `j`. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, the printed output is 'NO' if the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`, and the next key-value pair in `mem` is `(i+1, j+1)`**
