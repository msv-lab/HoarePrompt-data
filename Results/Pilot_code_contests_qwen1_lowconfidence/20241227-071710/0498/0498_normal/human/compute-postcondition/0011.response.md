The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. Since no further assignments or operations are performed after this call, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`; printed output is 'NO'**
