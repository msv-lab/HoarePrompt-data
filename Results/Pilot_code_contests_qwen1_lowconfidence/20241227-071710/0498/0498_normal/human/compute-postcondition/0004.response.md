The code appends the list `[x, y]` to the existing list in `mem2[y - x]`. The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists with an additional entry `mem2[y - x]` containing the list `[x, y]`
- `out` is an empty list
- `a` must contain at least one tuple to process in the next iteration

After executing the line `mem2[y - x].append([x, y])`, the value of `mem2[y - x]` will be updated to include the new list `[x, y]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists with an additional entry `mem2[y - x]` containing the list `[x, y]` followed by `[x, y]`, `out` is an empty list, `a` must contain at least one tuple to process in the next iteration**
