The code snippet `out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))` impacts the following:

1. `mem2[w[i]].pop()` removes and returns the last pair from the list associated with the key `w[i]` in `mem2`.
2. `' '.join(map(str, ...))` converts the elements of the pair to strings and joins them with a space.
3. `out.append(...)` appends the resulting string to the list `out`.

Given the initial state:
- `out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string.
- `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`.
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `labels[x][y]` is `i + 1`.
- `out` includes a new string representing the last popped pair.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

After executing the code snippet, the impact on the variables is:
- `mem2[w[i]].pop()` removes the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `out` now includes the new string representing the removed pair.

Thus, the output state is:
- `out` is updated to include the new string representing the last popped pair.
- `mem2[w[i]]` has the last pair removed.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem2[w[i]]` has the last pair removed, `i` is `i + 1`**
