The code assigns the first and second elements of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]` to `x` and `y`, respectively. The variables `n`, `w`, `mem`, `mem2`, and `labels` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, and the condition for printing 'NO' is not checked as the code does not modify `labels` directly.**
