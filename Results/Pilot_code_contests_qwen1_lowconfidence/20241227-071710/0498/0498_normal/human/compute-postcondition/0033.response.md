Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string.
   - `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`.
   - `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]] before popping`.
   - `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]] before popping`.
   - The condition for printing 'NO' is not checked as the code does not modify `labels` directly.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the range of `n`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can potentially execute again.
   - The loop counter `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 at each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1 (assuming it started from 0).

4. **Modifying States**:
   - `x` and `y` are derived from the last pair in `mem2[w[i]]` before popping. Since `i` increases by 1, we need to consider the new last pair in `mem2[w[i]]`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 unless the loop breaks or completes its iterations.

5. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - `out` will still be an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, but the pair will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `mem` and `mem2` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but we assume no modifications in this context.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `x` and `y` are updated to the first and second elements of the new last pair in `mem2[w[i]]`.

Given these points, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]] before popping`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]] before popping`, and the condition for printing 'NO' is not checked as the code does not modify `labels` directly.** 

However, for clarity, let's explicitly mention the changes:

- `i` will be 1.
- `x` and `y` will be updated to the first and second elements of the new last pair in `mem2[w[1]]`.

State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, and the condition for printing 'NO' is not checked as the code does not modify `labels` directly.**
