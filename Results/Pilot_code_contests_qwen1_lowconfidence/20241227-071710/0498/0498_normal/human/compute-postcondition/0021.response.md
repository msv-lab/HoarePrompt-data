The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately without executing any further code. Since the program is terminated, no further assignments or changes to variables occur. The printed output condition ('NO' if the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`) does not get evaluated because the program ends before reaching this point. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer**
