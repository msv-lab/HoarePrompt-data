Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mem2[i]` is a string.
   - `j` is an integer.
   - The printed output is 'NO'.

2. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over key-value pairs in the `mem` dictionary using `for (i, j) in mem.items()`. This means `i` is the key and `j` is the value from the dictionary `mem`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are more key-value pairs in the `mem` dictionary.

4. **State Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the dictionary items, we need to check if there are more items left in `mem`.
   - If there are more items, `i` will be updated to the next key and `j` will be updated to the corresponding value.
   - The printed output being 'NO' suggests that the loop body did not change this output during the last iteration. Therefore, the output will remain 'NO' unless the loop body changes it.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that `mem` has more items left for the loop to continue.
   - `i` will be updated to the next key in `mem`.
   - `j` will be updated to the value associated with that key.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `mem` must have more items.
- `i` will be updated to the next key in `mem`.
- `j` will be updated to the value associated with the next key.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, and the printed output is 'NO'**.

However, to be more precise, we should indicate that `i` and `j` will be updated to the next key-value pair in `mem`. Since we don't know the exact values of `i` and `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can just state that they will be updated accordingly.

Final Answer:
State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, and the printed output is 'NO'**. At the start of the next iteration, `i` and `j` will be updated to the next key-value pair in `mem`.
