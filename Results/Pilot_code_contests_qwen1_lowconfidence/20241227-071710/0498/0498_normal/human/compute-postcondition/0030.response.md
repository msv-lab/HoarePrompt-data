The code `exit()` is used to terminate the program. In this context, the program will stop executing immediately upon reaching this line, without changing the values of any variables. The only information that remains is the preconditions listed.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\), `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `labels[x][y] = i + 1`, the condition `(i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y])` is true, and the program prints 'NO'**
