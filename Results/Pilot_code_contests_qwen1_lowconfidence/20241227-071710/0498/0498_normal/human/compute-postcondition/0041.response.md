The code assigns the values of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]` to `x` and `y`. Before this assignment, `x` was the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, and `y` was the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`. Since the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]` has been popped, these values are no longer relevant. Now, `x` and `y` take the values of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `labels[x][y]` is `i + 1`, `out` includes a new string representing the last popped pair, `i` is `i + 1`**.
