`mem2[y - x]` is appended with a list containing `[x, y]`. The values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unspecified. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists with an additional entry `mem2[y - x]` containing the list `[x, y]`, `out` is an empty list, `a` must contain at least one tuple**
