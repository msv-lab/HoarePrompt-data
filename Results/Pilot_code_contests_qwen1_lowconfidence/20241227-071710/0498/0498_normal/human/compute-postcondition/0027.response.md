The code `labels[x][y] = i + 1` assigns the value `i + 1` to the element in the dictionary `labels` at the key `(x, y)`. Given the initial conditions:

- `out` is an empty list.
- `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`.
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`.
- `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`.

The only affected variable is `labels`, which now contains the key `(x, y)` with the value `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\), `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `labels[x][y] = i + 1`**
