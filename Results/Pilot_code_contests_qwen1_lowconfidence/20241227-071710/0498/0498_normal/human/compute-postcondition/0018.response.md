The code `mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)` sorts the string `mem2[i]` in reverse order. However, strings in Python are immutable, so sorting a string does not modify the original string but instead returns a new sorted string. Since `mem2[i]` is a string, the sort operation does not change its value, and no new variable is assigned. The other variables `j` and the printed output (which is not a variable) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, and the printed output is 'NO' if the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`.**
