The code snippet appends the last popped pair from `mem2[w[i]]` to the `out` list as a string where elements are joined by spaces. Let's break down the steps:

1. `mem2[w[i]]` refers to the list associated with the key `w[i]` in `mem2`.
2. `.pop()` removes and returns the last element (a pair) from this list.
3. `map(str, ...)` converts the elements of the pair to strings.
4. `' '.join(...)` joins these string elements with a space.
5. This resulting string is appended to the `out` list.

Since the exact values of the variables are not specified, we'll keep the output state in terms of the structure and known conditions.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `labels[x][y]` is `i + 1`, `out` includes a new string representing the last popped pair.**
