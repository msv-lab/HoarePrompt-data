Functionality: **The function processes a set of points defined by their coordinates \((x, y)\) and a list of integers \(w\). It verifies certain conditions on these points and assigns unique labels to them based on specific criteria. If all conditions are met, it prints 'YES' followed by the labels in a formatted output. If any condition fails, it prints 'NO' and exits immediately. Specifically, it checks that the number of points associated with each value in \(w\) matches the count in \(mem\), sorts the points for each slope \(y - x\) in reverse order, and ensures that the labeling process does not violate certain constraints.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the input does not satisfy the condition that for every point \((x, y)\), all points \((x', y')\) where \(0 \leq x' \leq x\) and \(0 \leq y' \leq y\) are present, the function will exit early and print 'NO'.
- If the length of `mem2[i]` does not match the value of `mem[i]` for any slope \(i\), the function will print 'NO' and exit.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input `a` is non-empty and that `w` contains valid integers. It does not handle cases where `a` might be empty or `w` might contain invalid inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
