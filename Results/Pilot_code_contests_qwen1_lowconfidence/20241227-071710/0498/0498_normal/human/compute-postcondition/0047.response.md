Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `out` is an empty list.
- `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`.
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\).
- For every key \(i\) in `mem2`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the value of `mem[i]` and `mem2[i]` is sorted in reverse order.
- `n` is the length of the list `w`.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(n):
    x, y = mem2[w[i]][-1]
    labels[x][y] = i + 1
    if i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]:
        print('NO')
        exit()
    out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `w`.
   - In each iteration, the last pair \([x, y]\) from `mem2[w[i]]` is popped and added to `out`.
   - The label `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - A check is performed to ensure that the labels are strictly increasing in the direction of the pairs. If the condition is violated, the program prints 'NO' and exits.

2. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - Since the loop iterates `n` times, `out` will contain `n` strings, each representing the popped pair from `mem2[w[i]]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The list `mem2[w[i]]` will be empty after all pairs are popped.
   - The dictionary `labels` will have its entries updated according to the rule \( labels[x][y] = i + 1 \).

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If the condition `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]` is never violated during the loop, the program will not print 'NO'.

4. **Final Values:**
   - `out` will contain `n` strings, each representing a pair \([x, y]\) that was popped from `mem2[w[i]]`.
   - `mem2[w[i]]` will be empty for all `i` because all pairs are popped.
   - `labels` will be updated such that for each pair \([x, y]\) that was popped, `labels[x][y]` will be the index of the pair in the sequence.

### Conclusion
If the loop executes without any violations of the conditions, the final state will be as follows:

Output State: **`out` is a list containing `n` strings, each representing a pair \([x, y]\) that was popped from `mem2[w[i]]`, `mem2[w[i]]` is empty for all `i`, `labels` is updated such that for each pair \([x, y]\) that was popped, `labels[x][y]` is the index of the pair in the sequence, and `n` is the length of the list `w`.**
