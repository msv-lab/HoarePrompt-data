According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `a` contains at least one tuple.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`
- `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists with an additional entry `mem2[y - x]` containing the list `[x, y]` followed by `[x, y]`
- `out` is an empty list
- `a` must contain at least one tuple to process in the next iteration

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must contain at least one tuple. Since it was stated that `a` must contain at least one tuple to process in the next iteration, we can conclude that this condition is already met.

However, we need to ensure that all other states remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists with an additional entry `mem2[y - x]` containing the list `[x, y]` followed by `[x, y]`, `out` is an empty list, `a` contains at least one tuple to process**
