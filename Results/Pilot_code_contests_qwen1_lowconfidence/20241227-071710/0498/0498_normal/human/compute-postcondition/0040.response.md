Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string.
   - `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`.
   - `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]` before popping.
   - `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]` before popping.
   - `labels[x][y]` is `i + 1`.
   - `out` includes a new string representing the last popped pair.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is controlled by the variable `i` and the value of `n`.

3. **Changes After the Previous Iteration:**
   - `out` now includes a new string representing the last popped pair.
   - `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1` (indicating the current iteration).
   - The last pair from `mem2[w[1]]` has been removed and is represented by `x` and `y`.

4. **For the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n` must hold true.
   - Since `i` was incremented in the previous iteration, `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).
   - `x` and `y` remain the same (they are based on the last pair from the previous iteration).

6. **Updated States:**
   - `out` is updated to include the new string representation of the last popped pair.
   - `labels[x][y]` is now `i + 1` (the new value of `i`).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `labels[x][y]` is `i + 1`, `out` includes a new string representing the last popped pair.** 

However, to reflect the start of the next iteration, we need to update `i` to `i + 1` and ensure `n` is still greater than 0.

State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[1]] before popping`, `labels[x][y]` is `i + 1`, `out` includes a new string representing the last popped pair, `i` is `i + 1`**.
