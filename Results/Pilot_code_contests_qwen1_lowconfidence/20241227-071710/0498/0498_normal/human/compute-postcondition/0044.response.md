The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately without further execution of the remaining statements. Given the initial state, the following variables are updated:

- `out` now includes a new string representing the last popped pair.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- "NO" is printed to the console.

After the exit command, no further actions can be taken, and the program terminates. Therefore, the states of `mem`, `mem2`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `labels[x][y]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` includes a string representing the last popped pair, `i` is `i + 1`, "NO" is printed to the console.**
