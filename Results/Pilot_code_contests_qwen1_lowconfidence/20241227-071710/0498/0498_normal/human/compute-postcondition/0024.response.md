Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) corresponding to tuples \((x, y)\) from `a`, and for every key \(i\) in `mem2`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the value of `mem[i]` and `mem2[i]` is sorted in reverse order.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`.
   - `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) corresponding to tuples \((x, y)\) from `a`.
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `a` must be an iterable containing tuples \((x, y)\) for the loop to execute at least once.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the items in `mem`. For each key \(i\), it checks if the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to the value of `mem[i]`.
   - If the condition `len(mem2[i]) != mem[i]` is true, the loop prints 'NO' and exits.
   - If the condition is false, it sorts `mem2[i]` in reverse order.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop finishes executing (or if it never executes due to the condition failing), `out` remains an empty list.
   - `mem` remains a Counter object of the list `w`.
   - `mem2` remains a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) corresponding to tuples \((x, y)\) from `a`.
   - For every key \(i\) in `mem2`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the value of `mem[i]` and `mem2[i]` is sorted in reverse order.

Thus, the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop (or after it fails to execute) is as stated above.
