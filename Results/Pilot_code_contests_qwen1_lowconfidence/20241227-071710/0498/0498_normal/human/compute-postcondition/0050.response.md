The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but deals with a set of points and their associated values defined within its scope. Specifically, the function first reads a series of points and their coordinates, followed by a list of special values. 

The functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a set of points defined by their coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) (where both \(x\) and \(y\) are integers between 0 and 100,000 inclusive), and a list of \(n\) integers \(w_i\) (where each \(w_i\) is an integer between -100,000 and 100,000 inclusive). The function does not return any explicit value but processes this data according to some internal logic.
