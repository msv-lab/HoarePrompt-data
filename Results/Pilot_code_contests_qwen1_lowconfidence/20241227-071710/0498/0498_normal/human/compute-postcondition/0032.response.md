The code appends a string representation of the popped item from `mem2[w[i]]` to the list `out`. Let's break down the steps:

1. `x` and `y` are derived from the last pair in `mem2[w[i]]`.
2. `out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))` pops the last pair from `mem2[w[i]]` and converts it to a space-separated string, which is then appended to `out`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are derived from the last pair in `mem2[w[i]]`, we need to represent the updated state accordingly. However, the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, so we'll refer to them as the last `x` and `y` values from the last pair.

The output `out` is updated with the popped pair as a string. The `mem2[w[i]]` dictionary now has one less entry since the last pair has been popped. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`out` is an empty list plus the popped pair as a string, `mem` is a Counter object of the list `w`, `mem2` is a defaultdict of lists where each key \(y - x\) contains a list of pairs \([x, y]\) minus the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]]`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the first element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]] before popping`, `y` is the second element of the last pair from the list in `mem2[w[i]] before popping`, and the condition for printing 'NO' is not checked as the code does not modify `labels` directly.**
