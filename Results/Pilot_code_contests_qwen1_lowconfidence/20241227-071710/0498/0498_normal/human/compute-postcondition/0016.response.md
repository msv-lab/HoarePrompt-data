The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means no further code is executed, and all changes to variables within the current scope are reverted. Therefore, the original values of `mem2[i]` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer**
