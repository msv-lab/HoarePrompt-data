The code `mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)` sorts the string in `mem2[i]` in reverse order. However, strings in Python are immutable, so sorting a string will not change its reference but create a new sorted string. The original string `mem2[i]` remains unchanged. The length of `mem2[i]` also remains the same. If the length of `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`, the condition `mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)` does not change the outcome of the comparison, so the printed output will still be 'NO'.

Output State: **`mem2[i]` is a string, `j` is an integer, and the printed output is 'NO'**
