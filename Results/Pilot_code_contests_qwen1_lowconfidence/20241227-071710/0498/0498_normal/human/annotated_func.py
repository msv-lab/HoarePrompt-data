#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The following n lines each contain two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000, representing the coordinates of a point in the set. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct and if some point (x, y) is present, then all points (x', y'), where 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y, are also present. The next line contains n integers wi such that -100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000, representing the required special values for the points.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of points defined by their coordinates \((x, y)\) and a list of integers \(w\). It verifies certain conditions on these points and assigns unique labels to them based on specific criteria. If all conditions are met, it prints 'YES' followed by the labels in a formatted output. If any condition fails, it prints 'NO' and exits immediately. Specifically, it checks that the number of points associated with each value in \(w\) matches the count in \(mem\), sorts the points for each slope \(y - x\) in reverse order, and ensures that the labeling process does not violate certain constraints.
