The function processes a set of points defined by their coordinates \((x, y)\) and a list of integers \(w\). It verifies certain conditions on these points and assigns unique labels to them based on specific criteria. If all conditions are met, it prints 'YES' followed by the labels in a formatted output. If any condition fails, it prints 'NO' and exits immediately. Specifically, it checks that the number of points associated with each value in \(w\) matches the count in \(mem\), sorts the points for each slope \(y - x\) in reverse order, and ensures that the labeling process does not violate certain constraints.
