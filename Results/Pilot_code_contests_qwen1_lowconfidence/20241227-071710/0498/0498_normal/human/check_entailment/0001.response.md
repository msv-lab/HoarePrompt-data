Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the points are numbered in an aesthetically pleasing manner according to the given conditions. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4
1 0
0 0
2 0
1 1
-1 -1 -2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the program incorrectly outputs:
```
YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
1 1
```

This is incorrect because the numbering does not satisfy the aesthetic condition. For example, point (1, 1) has a special value of 1, but point (1, 0) (which has a special value of -1) should have a number greater than or equal to 1, and point (2, 0) (which has a special value of -2) should also have a number greater than or equal to 1. However, the point (1, 0) is assigned a number 2, which violates the aesthetic condition.

The issue lies in the logic of assigning numbers to points. The program sorts the points based on their special values but does not ensure that the numbering respects the aesthetic condition for all points. Specifically, the program does not check if the condition `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]` holds before assigning the number, which is necessary to maintain the aesthetic condition.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
