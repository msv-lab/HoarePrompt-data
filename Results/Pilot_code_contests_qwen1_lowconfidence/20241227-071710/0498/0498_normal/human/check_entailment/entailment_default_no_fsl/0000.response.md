Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the special values \(w_i\) are not consistent with the structure of the set of points. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the points with higher \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates have numbers not less than the points with lower \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates, which is a crucial part of the aesthetically pleasing numbering requirement.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
4
1 0
0 0
2 0
0 1
0 -1 -2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
0 1
```

However, the provided code will fail to produce the correct output because it does not properly enforce the aesthetic numbering constraint. Specifically, it does not ensure that for any point \((x, y)\) with number \(i\), all points \((x', y')\) with \(x' \geq x\) and \(y' \geq y\) have numbers not less than \(i\).

To illustrate, in the given input, the point \((1, 0)\) has \(w_i = -1\), but the point \((0, 1)\) has \(w_i = 1\). According to the problem description, the point \((0, 1)\) should have a number greater than or equal to the number assigned to \((1, 0)\), which is not the case here. The provided code does not catch this inconsistency and would incorrectly print "YES" and a wrong numbering.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence the correctness is **False**.
