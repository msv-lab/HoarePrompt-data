Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of points `n` and the coordinates of the points from the input.
   - It also reads the list of special values `w` associated with each point.
   - The `mem` counter and `mem2` dictionary are initialized to store the counts and lists of points with the same special value `y - x`.

2. **Validation and Sorting:**
   - The program iterates over the points and populates `mem2` such that for each point `(x, y)`, the difference `y - x` is used as a key in `mem2`. The value for this key is a list of points.
   - After populating `mem2`, the program checks if the length of the list for each key matches the count in `mem`. If any discrepancy is found, it prints "NO" and exits immediately.
   - Points for each key in `mem2` are sorted in reverse order based on their coordinates.

3. **Label Assignment and Validation:**
   - The program then assigns labels to the points based on the sorted order in `mem2`.
   - During this assignment, it ensures that the label assignment respects the aesthetic pleasing condition, i.e., if a point `(x, y)` gets a label `i`, then all points `(x', y')` with `x' ≥ x` and `y' ≥ y` should get labels not less than `i`.
   - If any violation of this condition is detected, the program prints "NO" and exits immediately.
   - If all labels are successfully assigned without any violations, the program prints "YES" and outputs the labels in the required format.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly checks and enforces all the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
