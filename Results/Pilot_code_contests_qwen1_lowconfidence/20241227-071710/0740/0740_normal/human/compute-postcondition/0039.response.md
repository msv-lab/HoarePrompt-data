Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is a list of two values read from the input source, `counter` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is the tuple \((i, j)\) with \(i\) being the index of the first occurrence of `xi` in `x` and \(j\) being the index of the last occurrence of `xi` in `x`, if an element `xi` does not appear in `x`, then `counter[xi]` remains \((-1, -1)\), `xi` is the last value processed in the loop, `res` is the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is \(-1\). The first element of `counter[i]` is \(-1\). If the first element of `counter[i + 1]` is \(-1\) or it is greater than the first element of `counter[i]`, then the condition holds as specified; otherwise, no change occurs since there is no else part.***
