Postcondition: **`res` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`. If `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`, then `res` is updated to `res + 1`. Otherwise, if `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`, then `res` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1, with the condition that `i + 1 < n`. If neither condition is met, `res` and `i` remain unchanged.**
