According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` in `args`. The loop iterates over each element in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, and `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, and the value of `file` now contains the written `str(x)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `args` that hasn't been processed yet. Since `at_start` is currently `False`, it means we are not at the beginning of the loop anymore, and the loop has already processed at least one element. Therefore, `args` must contain at least two elements.

At the start of the next iteration, `at_start` should be `True` (indicating the beginning of the loop), and `sep` and `file` remain unchanged from the previous iteration. `x` will be the next element in `args`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `at_start` becomes `True`
- `sep` remains the same (either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`)
- `file` remains the same (either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`)
- `x` becomes the next element in `args`

State: **`at_start` is `True`, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, and `x` is the next element in `args`**
