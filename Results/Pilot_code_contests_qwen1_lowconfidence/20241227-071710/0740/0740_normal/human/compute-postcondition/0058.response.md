The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was previously unchanged in the initial state, it now becomes `res` is the original value of `res` plus 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, `counter`, and `xi`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is a list of two values read from the input source, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the tuple \((i, j)\) with \(i\) being the index of the first occurrence of `xi` in `x` and \(j\) being the index of the last occurrence of `xi` in `x`, if an element `xi` does not appear in `x`, then `counter[xi]` remains \((-1, -1)\), `xi` is the value at index 2 in `x`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus 1**
