The code `file.flush()` flushes the buffer associated with the file object, but does not change the values of the variables `at_start`, `sep`, or `file`. The variable `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` was set to `True` initially, and since the `flush` method does not modify this value, it remains `True`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, `file` now contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and ends with `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`, and `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`.**
