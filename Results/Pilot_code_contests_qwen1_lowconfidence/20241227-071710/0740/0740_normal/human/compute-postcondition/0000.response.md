The given code snippet is a documentation string (docstring) for a function called `print()`. It describes what the function does but does not change any variable values or states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The function does not contribute to solving the problem as described. It prints values to a stream or the standard output and does not take any arguments related to the game scenario. The function takes variable arguments (*args) and keyword arguments.**
