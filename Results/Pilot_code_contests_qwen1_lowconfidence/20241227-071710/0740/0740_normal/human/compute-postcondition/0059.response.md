Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is a list of two values read from the input source, `counter` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is the tuple \((i, j)\) with \(i\) being the index of the first occurrence of `xi` in `x` and \(j\) being the index of the last occurrence of `xi` in `x`, if an element `xi` does not appear in `x`, then `counter[xi]` remains \((-1, -1)\), `xi` is the value at index 2 in `x`. If `counter[i][0] != -1`, `res` is incremented by 1 if either (1) `counter[i + 1][0]` is \(-1\) or greater than `counter[i][1]`, or (2) `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][0]`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. If `counter[i][0] == -1`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus 1.***
