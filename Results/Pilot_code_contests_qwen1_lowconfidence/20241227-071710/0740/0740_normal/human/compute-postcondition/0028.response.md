Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), `x` is a list of two values read from the input source, `counter` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is the tuple \((-1, -1)\), `i` is 3, `xi` is the third value processed in the loop, `res` is 3. If the first occurrence of `xi` in `x` does not exist (i.e., `counter[i][0] == -1`), then `res` is set to 3. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged (i.e., still 2).***
