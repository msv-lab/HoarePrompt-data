The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The initial value of `res` is 2, so after the code execution, `res` becomes 3. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), `x` is a list of two values read from the input source, `counter` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is the tuple \((-1, -1)\), `i` is 3, `xi` is the third value processed in the loop, `res` is 3.**
