Let's break down the given information step by step to determine the necessary states before the loop can execute.

### Given Information:
- The initial state before the loop starts:
  - `at_start` is `True`
  - `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`
  - `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`

- The loop iterates over each element in `args`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is based on `args`. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.
2. **Variables Used in the Loop**:
   - `x` will take the value of each element in `args` during each iteration.
3. **Initial States**:
   - `at_start` being `True` indicates that this might be the initial setup or starting point, but it doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `sep` and `file` are placeholders for default values if specific arguments are not provided via `kwargs`. These are used within the loop but do not affect the loop's ability to run as long as `args` contains elements.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute if `args` is a non-empty list or tuple. Therefore, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `args` contains at least one element.

### Final State:
State: **`at_start` is True, sep is either the value of kwargs.pop('sep', b' ') or b' ', file is either the value of kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout) or sys.stdout, args is a non-empty list or tuple**
