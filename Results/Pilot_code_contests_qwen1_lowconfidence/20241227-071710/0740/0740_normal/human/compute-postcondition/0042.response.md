The variable `res` is incremented by 1, starting from its previous value, which was the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is \(-1\). Since `counter[i][0]` is \(-1\), it contributes to this count. After executing `res += 1`, `res` will now be one more than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is a list of two values read from the input source, `counter` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is the tuple \((i, j)\) with \(i\) being the index of the first occurrence of `xi` in `x` and \(j\) being the index of the last occurrence of `xi` in `x`, if an element `xi` does not appear in `x`, then `counter[xi]` remains \((-1, -1)\), `xi` is the last value processed in the loop, `res` is the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is \(-1\) plus 1, `counter[i][0]` is \(-1`**
