Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `x`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), and `x` is a list of `k` positive integers such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq n\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `k`. The function constructs a counter array `counter` that tracks the first and last occurrences of each integer in `x`. It then iterates through this counter array to determine the number of unique elements in `x` whose first occurrence index is either \(-1\) or greater than the first occurrence index of the next element. Finally, the function calls `func_2` with the result `res`, which is the count of such elements.

Specifically, the function performs the following actions:
1. Initializes a `counter` array of length \(n + 1\) filled with tuples \((-1, -1)\).
2. Iterates through the list `x` to populate the `counter` array with the indices of the first and last occurrences of each element.
3. Iterates through the `counter` array to count the number of elements whose first occurrence index is \(-1\) or where the first occurrence index is greater than the first occurrence index of the next element (if applicable).
4. Calls `func_2` with the count `res`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `x` contains at least one element. If `x` is empty, the behavior is undefined because the loops will iterate without finding any elements.
- The function does not handle the case where the last element in `x` does not have a subsequent element to compare with in the final two loops. This could lead to incorrect results if `x` only has one element or if the last element's first occurrence index is not \(-1\).**

Note: The initial annotation suggests that `x` is a list of `k` values, but the code only reads `n` and `k` and then expects `x` to be a list of `k` values. This discrepancy should be noted.
