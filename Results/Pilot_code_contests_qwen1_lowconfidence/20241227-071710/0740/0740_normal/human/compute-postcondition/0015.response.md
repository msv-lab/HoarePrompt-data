The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file `file`. The value of `sep` remains unchanged, and the value of `file` also remains unchanged. After executing this line of code, the file object `file` will have written the content of `sep` to it.

Output State: **`at_start` is `True`; `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`; `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`; the file object `file` has written the content of `sep` to it.**
