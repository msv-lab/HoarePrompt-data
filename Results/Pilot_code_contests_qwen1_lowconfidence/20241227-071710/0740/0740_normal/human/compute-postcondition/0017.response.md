`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object `file`. The initial state includes that `at_start` is `False` and the file object `file` has already written the content of `sep` to it. After executing this line of code, the file will now have the content of `sep` followed by the string representation of `x`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`; the file object `file` has written the content of `sep` and the string representation of `x` to it**
