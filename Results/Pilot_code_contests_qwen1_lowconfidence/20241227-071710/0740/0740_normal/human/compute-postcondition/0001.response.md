The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` has the following impacts:

1. `kwargs` is modified by popping the `'sep'` and `'file'` keys.
   - If `'sep'` is in `kwargs`, its value is assigned to `sep`. Otherwise, `b' '` (a byte string with a space) is assigned to `sep`.
   - If `'file'` is in `kwargs`, its value is assigned to `file`. Otherwise, `sys.stdout` (the standard output stream) is assigned to `file`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `kwargs`, we can only express the updated state in terms of what `sep` and `file` are based on the logic of the code.

Output State: **`sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`.**
