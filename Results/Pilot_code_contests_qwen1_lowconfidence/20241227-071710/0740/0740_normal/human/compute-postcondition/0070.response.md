Postcondition: ***`res` is the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is -1, `n` must be at least 2, the current value of `i` plus one has a first occurrence index of -1. After executing the if statement, if `counter[i][0]` is either -1 or greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`, `res` will be incremented by 1. There is no else part, so the value of `res` remains unchanged if the condition `counter[i][0] == -1 or counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][0]` is not met.***
