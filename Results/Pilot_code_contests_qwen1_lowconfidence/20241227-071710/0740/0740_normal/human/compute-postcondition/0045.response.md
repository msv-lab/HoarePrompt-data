The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was previously the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is \(-1\), the new value of `res` is the previous count plus 1. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, `counter`, and `xi`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is a list of two values read from the input source, `counter` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is the tuple \((i, j)\) with \(i\) being the index of the first occurrence of `xi` in `x` and \(j\) being the index of the last occurrence of `xi` in `x`, if an element `xi` does not appear in `x`, then `counter[xi]` remains \((-1, -1)\), `xi` is the last value processed in the loop, `res` is the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is \(-1\) + 1**
