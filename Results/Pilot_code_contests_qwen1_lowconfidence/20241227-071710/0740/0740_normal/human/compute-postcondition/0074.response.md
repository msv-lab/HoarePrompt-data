Postcondition: ***`res` is the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is -1. Given the initial precondition that `res` is the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is -1 and `n` is at least 2, the following changes occur:
- If `counter[i + 1][0]` is not -1, `res` is incremented by 1 if `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`, or `counter[i + 1][1]` is -1 and `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`.
- If `counter[i + 1][0]` is -1, `res` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes of the if-else block based on the conditions provided for both the if and else parts.
