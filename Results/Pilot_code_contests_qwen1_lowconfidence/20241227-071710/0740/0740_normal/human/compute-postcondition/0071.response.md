Postcondition: **`res` is the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is -1. `n` must be at least 2. The current value of `i` plus one does not have a first occurrence index of -1. If `counter[i + 1][1]` is not -1, `res` is incremented by 1 under the conditions that `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`. If `counter[i + 1][1]` is -1, `res` is incremented by 1 under the conditions that `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged.**
