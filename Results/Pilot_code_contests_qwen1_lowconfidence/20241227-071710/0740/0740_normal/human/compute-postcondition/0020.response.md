`file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')` to `file`. The initial state tells us that `file` contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`. After executing this line of code, `file` will have the content it originally had plus the value of `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`.

- `at_start` remains `False` because the code does not affect it.
- `sep` remains the same because the code does not affect it.
- `file` now contains the original content plus `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`.

Output State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, `file` now contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and ends with `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`.**
