According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `args` list or tuple. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `args`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `at_start` is `False`
- `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`
- `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`
- `args` is a non-empty list or tuple

For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must still contain at least one element.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

1. `at_start` remains `False` because it indicates the start of the loop, which has already occurred.
2. `sep` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
3. `file` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
4. `args` must now be an empty list or tuple (since one element was processed in the previous iteration).

State: **`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, `args` is an empty list or tuple**
