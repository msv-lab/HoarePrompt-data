`res` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `counter[i + 1][0]` is still \(-1\). Therefore, the updated state of `res` is the original count plus 1.

Output State: **`res` is the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is \(-1\) plus 1, `n` is at least 2, and `counter[i + 1][0]` is \(-1\)**
