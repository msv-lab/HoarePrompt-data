`res` is incremented by 1, meaning `res` is now `res + 1`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 to become `i + 1`, and the condition that `i + 1` must be less than `n` still holds. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated to `res + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`**
