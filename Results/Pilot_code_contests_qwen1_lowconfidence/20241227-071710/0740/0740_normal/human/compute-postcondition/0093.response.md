The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems the parameters are defined within the function body, specifically `n`, `k`, and `x`. However, based on the provided format and constraints, we should focus on describing the parameters as given in the constraints.

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\).
- `x` is a list of `k` positive integers such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq n\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `k`.

Given the output cases described, the function returns different values based on the input list `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `x` (where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), and `x` is a list of `k` positive integers such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq n\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `k`). The function returns based on the conditions specified in the output cases.**
