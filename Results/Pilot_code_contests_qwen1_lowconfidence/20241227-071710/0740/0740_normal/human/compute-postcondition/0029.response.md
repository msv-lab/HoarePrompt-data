Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), `x` is a list of two values read from the input source, `counter` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is the tuple \((i, j)\) with \(i\) being the index of the first occurrence of `xi` in `x` and \(j\) being the index of the last occurrence of `xi` in `x`, if an element `xi` does not appear in `x`, then `counter[xi]` remains \((-1, -1)\), `i` is \(n + 1\), `xi` is the last value processed in the loop, `res` is the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is \(-1\).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- For each iteration, it checks if the first occurrence of `xi` in `x` is \(-1\) using the condition `counter[i][0] == -1`.
- If the condition is true, `res` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1` since the loop runs from `1` to `n`.
- `xi` will be the last value processed in the loop, which is `n`.
- `res` will be the count of elements in `counter` whose first occurrence index is \(-1\), because for each such element, `res` was incremented by 1 during the loop.
