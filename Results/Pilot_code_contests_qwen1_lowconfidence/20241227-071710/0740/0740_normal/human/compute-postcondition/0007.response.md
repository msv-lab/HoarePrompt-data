The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object pointed to by `file`. The `file` object itself does not change; it simply appends the string to it. The `str(x)` function converts `x` to its string representation, which is then written to the file.

Since the initial state of `at_start` is a boolean value, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, and `args` is a non-empty list or tuple, and since `at_start` is not specified as `False`, the values of `at_start`, `sep`, `file`, and `args` remain unchanged. However, the content of the file changes due to the write operation.

Output State: **`at_start` is a boolean value, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, `args` is a non-empty list or tuple, the file object has been updated with the string representation of `x`.**
