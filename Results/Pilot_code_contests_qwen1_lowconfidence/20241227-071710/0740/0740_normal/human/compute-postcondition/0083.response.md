According to the provided information, the loop updates the variable `res` based on certain conditions and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. The key points are:

1. `res` is updated based on the conditions involving `counter[i][0]` and `counter[i + 1][0]`.
2. `i` is incremented by 1 in both cases (whether `res` is incremented or not).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `res` is updated based on the conditions.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n` must hold true. Therefore, `i` should be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's summarize the required adjustments:

1. `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
2. For the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`res` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is incremented by 1 to become `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`**
