The function `func_2(res)` is called, but no specific changes to the variables are made within this function call. The value of `res` is passed to `func_2`, but the function does not modify `res` or any other global variables based on the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only thing that happens is that `res` is passed to `func_2`.

Output State: **`res` is the count of elements in `counter` such that the first occurrence index is `-1` or the first occurrence index of the element at position `i` is greater than the first occurrence index of the element at position `i + 1` when `counter[i + 1][0]` is not `-1`. The value of `res` has been passed to `func_2`.**
