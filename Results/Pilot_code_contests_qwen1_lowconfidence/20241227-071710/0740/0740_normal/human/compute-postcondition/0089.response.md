`res` is incremented by 1, meaning `res` is now `res + 1`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 to become `i + 1`, and it must still be less than `n`. The initial condition that `i + 1` must be less than `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is `res + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`**
