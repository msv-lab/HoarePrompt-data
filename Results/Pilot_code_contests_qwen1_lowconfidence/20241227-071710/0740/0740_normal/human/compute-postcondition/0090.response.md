Postcondition: ***`res` is updated based on the conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i + 1` must be less than `n`. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is not -1 and either `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][1]`, then `res` is updated to `res + 1`. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is not -1 and either `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`, then `res` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` and `i` remain unchanged. If `counter[i + 1][0]` is -1, then `res` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.***
