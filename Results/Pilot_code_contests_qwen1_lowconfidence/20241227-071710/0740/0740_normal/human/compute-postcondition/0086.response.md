`res` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, since `i + 1` must be less than `n`, the exact values of `res` and `i` depend on their initial values and the condition specified. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 and must satisfy `i + 1 < n`**
