Postcondition: ***`res` is updated based on the conditions. If `counter[i][0]` is -1 or `counter[i][0]` is greater than `counter[i + 1][0]`, then `res` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1, with the condition that `i + 1 < n`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res` and `i` is incremented by 1.***
