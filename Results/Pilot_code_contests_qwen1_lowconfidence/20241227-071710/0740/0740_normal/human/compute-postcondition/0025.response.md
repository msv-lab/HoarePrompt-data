Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). It prints the arguments to a specified output stream, using a separator and an end character, and optionally flushes the stream. The function does not return anything.

After executing the function:
- If no `sep` argument is provided, the default separator is a space (`b' '`).
- If no `end` argument is provided, the default end character is a newline (`b'\n'`).
- If no `file` argument is provided, the output is written to `sys.stdout`.
- The function writes each argument in `args` to the specified output stream, separated by the provided `sep`.
- After writing all arguments, it appends the provided `end` character to the output.
- If `flush` is set to `True`, the function flushes the output stream; otherwise, it does nothing.

Potential edge cases:
- If `args` is empty, no output is generated.
- If `sep` is not provided, the default is a space (`b' '`).
- If `end` is not provided, the default is a newline (`b'\n'`).
- If `file` is not provided, the default is `sys.stdout`.

Missing functionality (based on annotations):
- The annotations suggest that `kwargs` might be modified in place, but the code only modifies `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, and `end`. No other keyword arguments are handled.
- The function does not check for the presence of required arguments, which could lead to errors if `args` is not provided.**

This summary covers the actual behavior of the function based on the provided code and addresses any potential edge cases or missing functionalities.
