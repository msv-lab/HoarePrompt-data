Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for scenarios where the last element in `x` does not have a subsequent element to compare with in the final two loops. This oversight can lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
n = 3
k = 2
x = [1, 3]
```

The function `func_1` will run through the loops and correctly identify that the token cannot be moved between these cells without violating the "NO" answers. However, it does not handle the case where the last element does not have a subsequent element to compare, leading to potentially incorrect results.

To illustrate, if the input was:
```
n = 3
k = 2
x = [1, 2]
```

The function would incorrectly count the number of valid scenarios because it does not properly handle the absence of a subsequent element for the last element in `x`.

Therefore, the code is not fully correct according to the problem description for every potential case.
