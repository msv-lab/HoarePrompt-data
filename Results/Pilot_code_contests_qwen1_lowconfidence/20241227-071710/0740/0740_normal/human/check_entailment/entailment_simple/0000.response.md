Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Scenarios:**
   - The program uses a `counter` array to track the first and last occurrences of each cell number in the sequence of Bob's questions.
   - However, the logic for counting valid scenarios is flawed. Specifically, the loops that check for valid scenarios do not correctly account for the rules of the game, particularly regarding the ability of Alice to move to an adjacent cell before or after answering each question.

2. **Missing Consideration of Adjacent Cells:**
   - The program does not explicitly consider the adjacency constraint between cells. For Alice to answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions, she must be able to move to an adjacent cell if necessary. The current implementation does not ensure this condition is met for each scenario.

3. **Overcounting or Undercounting Scenarios:**
   - The program's logic for counting valid scenarios is overly simplistic and does not fully account for all possible valid movements Alice can make. It may overcount or undercount the number of valid scenarios.

### Correct Implementation
To correctly implement the solution, the program should:
- Track the first and last occurrence of each cell in Bob's questions.
- Ensure that Alice can move to an adjacent cell if necessary to answer "NO" to all questions.
- Count all valid starting and ending positions for Alice such that she can answer "NO" to all questions.

Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Track first and last occurrence of each cell
    first_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
    last_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
    
    for i, xi in enumerate(x):
        if first_occurrence[xi] == -1:
            first_occurrence[xi] = i
        last_occurrence[xi] = i
    
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if first_occurrence[i] == -1:
            res += 1
        else:
            if i > 1 and last_occurrence[i-1] < first_occurrence[i]:
                res += 1
            if i < n and last_occurrence[i+1] < first_occurrence[i]:
                res += 1
    
    print(res)

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Implementation:
1. **Tracking First and Last Occurrences:**
   - Use dictionaries to track the first and last occurrence of each cell.
   
2. **Counting Valid Scenarios:**
   - For each cell `i`, if it appears in the sequence of Bob's questions:
     - Check if Alice can move from the previous cell (`i-1`) or the next cell (`i+1`) to cell `i` and still answer "NO" to all questions.
     - Increment the result if either condition is met.

This implementation ensures that Alice can move to an adjacent cell if necessary and counts all valid scenarios correctly.
