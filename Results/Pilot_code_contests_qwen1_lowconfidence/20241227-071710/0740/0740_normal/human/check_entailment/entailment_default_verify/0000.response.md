Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of valid scenarios for Alice. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not properly handle the movement of the token and the adjacency constraint. The `counter` array is used in a manner that does not fully capture the problem requirements, leading to incorrect counts of valid scenarios. The provided output hints further confirm that the program does not handle the movement and adjacency rules correctly, which is crucial for determining the number of valid scenarios. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of False is appropriate.
