Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly count the number of scenarios that let Alice answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. Specifically, the code has several issues:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not properly handle the edge cases where the input list `x` is empty or only contains one element. When `x` is empty, the loops will iterate without finding any elements, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Final Comparison Logic**: The final two loops in `func_1` do not correctly handle the case where the last element in `x` does not have a subsequent element to compare with. This could lead to incorrect results if `x` only has one element or if the last element's first occurrence index is not \(-1\).

Here is a more detailed explanation of the issues:

- **Empty Input List**: If `x` is empty, the loops will iterate without finding any elements, leading to an incorrect result. The function should handle this case separately.

- **Single Element Input**: If `x` contains only one element, the current logic will incorrectly count this scenario. The correct logic should consider that a single element scenario is valid if the token does not move.

To fix these issues, the code should explicitly handle these edge cases and ensure that the logic for counting valid scenarios is correct. Here is a possible corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = readlist()
    x = readlist()
    
    # Handle empty input list
    if not x:
        res = n * 3  # Each cell can be the start and end of a valid scenario
        func_2(res)
        return
    
    counter = [(-1, -1)] * (n + 1)
    for (i, xi) in enumerate(x):
        if counter[xi][0] == -1:
            counter[xi] = (i, -1)
        else:
            counter[xi] = (counter[xi][0], i)
    
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if counter[i][0] == -1:
            res += 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if counter[i][0] != -1:
            if counter[i][1] != -1:
                if counter[i + 1][0] == -1 or counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1]:
                    res += 1
            elif counter[i + 1][0] == -1 or counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][0]:
                res += 1
        else:
            res += 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if counter[i + 1][0] != -1:
            if counter[i + 1][1] != -1:
                if counter[i][0] == -1 or counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][1]:
                    res += 1
            elif counter[i][0] == -1 or counter[i][0] > counter[i + 1][0]:
                res += 1
        else:
            res += 1
    func_2(res)
```

This corrected version handles the edge cases and ensures that the logic for counting valid scenarios is correct.
