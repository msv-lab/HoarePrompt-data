Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the last element in `x` does not have a subsequent element to compare with in the final two loops. Specifically, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5 3
5 1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

However, the provided code will not correctly handle this case, leading to an incorrect result. To illustrate the issue, let's walk through the example step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `counter = [(-1, -1)] * (n + 1)` initializes the counter array.
   - Populate `counter` based on `x`:
     - `counter[5] = (0, 0)`
     - `counter[1] = (1, 1)`
     - `counter[4] = (2, 2)`

2. **First Loop (Counting elements with first occurrence index == -1):**
   - `res += 1` for `i = 2, 3` (since `counter[2]` and `counter[3]` are \((-1, -1)\)).

3. **Second Loop (Checking conditions for elements between 1 and n-1):**
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `counter[1] = (1, 1)` and `counter[2] = (-1, -1)` → `res += 1`.
     - `counter[1] = (1, 1)` and `counter[2] = (1, 1)` → no change.
   - For `i = 2`:
     - `counter[2] = (-1, -1)` and `counter[3] = (-1, -1)` → no change.
   - For `i = 3`:
     - `counter[3] = (-1, -1)` and `counter[4] = (2, 2)` → `res += 1`.
   - For `i = 4`:
     - `counter[4] = (2, 2)` and `counter[5] = (0, 0)` → `res += 1`.

4. **Third Loop (Checking conditions for elements between 1 and n-1, reversed):**
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `counter[1] = (1, 1)` and `counter[2] = (-1, -1)` → `res += 1`.
   - For `i = 2`:
     - `counter[2] = (-1, -1)` and `counter[3] = (-1, -1)` → no change.
   - For `i = 3`:
     - `counter[3] = (-1, -1)` and `counter[4] = (2, 2)` → `res += 1`.
   - For `i = 4`:
     - `counter[4] = (2, 2)` and `counter[5] = (0, 0)` → `res += 1`.

The total count `res` should be 9, but the provided code will miss counting some scenarios due to the lack of handling the last element properly. Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case.
