#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `x`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\), and `x` is a list of `k` positive integers such that \(1 \leq x_i \leq n\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `k`. The function constructs a counter array `counter` that tracks the first and last occurrences of each integer in `x`. It then iterates through this counter array to determine the number of unique elements in `x` whose first occurrence index is either \(-1\) or greater than the first occurrence index of the next element. Finally, the function calls `func_2` with the result `res`, which is the count of such elements.

Specifically, the function performs the following actions:
1. Initializes a `counter` array of length \(n + 1\) filled with tuples \((-1, -1)\).
2. Iterates through the list `x` to populate the `counter` array with the indices of the first and last occurrences of each element.
3. Iterates through the `counter` array to count the number of elements whose first occurrence index is \(-1\) or where the first occurrence index is greater than the first occurrence index of the next element (if applicable).
4. Calls `func_2` with the count `res`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `x` contains at least one element. If `x` is empty, the behavior is undefined because the loops will iterate without finding any elements.
- The function does not handle the case where the last element in `x` does not have a subsequent element to compare with in the final two loops. This could lead to incorrect results if `x` only has one element or if the last element's first occurrence index is not \(-1\).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `at_start` is `False`, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, `file` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` or `sys.stdout`, and `file` now contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`at_start` is `False`, `sep` is either the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', b' ')` or `b' '`, `file` now contains the concatenated string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and ends with `kwargs.pop('end', b'\n')`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the function flushes the output stream. Otherwise, no additional action is taken.
