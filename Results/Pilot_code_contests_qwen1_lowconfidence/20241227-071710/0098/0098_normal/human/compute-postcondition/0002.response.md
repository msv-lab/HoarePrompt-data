Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an odd integer `n` within the range 3 to 199 (inclusive). It calculates and returns the value of \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\). There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code, but the function assumes that `n` is always an odd integer within the specified range. If `n` is not an odd integer or falls outside the range, the behavior is undefined based on the given code.**

This summary focuses on the actual functionality of the function as described by the code, ensuring that only the relevant and accurate information is included.
