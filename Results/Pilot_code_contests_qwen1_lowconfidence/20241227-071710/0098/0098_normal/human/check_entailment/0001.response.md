Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of the square needed to embed a 2n-gon. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect for odd values of `n`. 

For a regular polygon with \(2n\) vertices, the minimum side length of the square required to embed it can be derived from the geometry of the polygon. The formula provided in the solution uses a cosine and sine function that does not account for the fact that \(n\) is odd. 

To illustrate the issue, consider the case when \(n = 3\):

- For \(n = 3\), we have a hexagon (6-sided polygon).
- The correct minimum side length of the square to embed a regular hexagon is \(\sqrt{3}\), which is approximately 1.732050808.
- However, the program calculates the value using the given function, which results in approximately 1.931851653, which is incorrect.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not handle the case where \(n\) is odd correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
