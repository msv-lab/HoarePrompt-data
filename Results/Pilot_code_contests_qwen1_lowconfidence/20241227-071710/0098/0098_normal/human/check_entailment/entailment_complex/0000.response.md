Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the problem description states that the goal is to find the square of the minimum size such that a 2n-gon can be embedded in the square. However, the function `func_1` in the provided code simply computes \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\), which does not directly correspond to the required output.

To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can contain a 2n-gon. The correct approach would involve determining the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the 2n-gon and then using that to find the side length of the square. The formula to find the side length \(s\) of the square that can contain a 2n-gon is:

\[ s = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \]

However, the provided code uses a different formula, which does not match the requirement to find the square of the minimum size that can contain the 2n-gon. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the task described in the problem statement.
