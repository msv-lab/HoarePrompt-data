Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of the square that can embed a 2n-gon for every potential case. The function `func_1` computes \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\), which is related to the geometry of the polygon but not directly the minimum side length of the enclosing square.

To properly solve this problem, we need to consider the geometry of a regular 2n-gon inscribed in a circle and then find the minimum square that can enclose this polygon. The correct formula for the side length \(s\) of the minimum enclosing square is given by:

\[ s = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \]

This formula accounts for the fact that the distance from the center of the circle to the farthest vertex of the 2n-gon along the diagonal of the square is the radius of the circumscribed circle of the 2n-gon.

However, the provided code computes a different value. Specifically, it calculates \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\), which is not the correct formula for the minimum side length of the square.

For example, let's consider \(n = 3\):

- The correct minimum side length should be \(\frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2\).
- But the code computes \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{12}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)} \approx 1.931851653\).

This discrepancy shows that the code does not correctly compute the minimum side length of the square. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
