Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version of the code confirms that the program uses the formula \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\) to calculate the minimum side length of the square that can embed a 2n-gon, regardless of whether \( n \) is even or odd. This formula is derived for even \( n \) and does not account for the case where \( n \) is odd. 

Given that the problem specifically states that \( n \) is always odd, the provided formula is incorrect for this case. The annotated version reinforces that the function `func_1` always uses the same formula without considering the parity of \( n \), leading to an incorrect result for odd \( n \). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
