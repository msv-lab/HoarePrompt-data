Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not calculate the minimum side length of the square that can embed the \(2n\)-gon. Instead, it computes a value based on trigonometric functions, which does not directly give the required side length of the square.

To solve the problem correctly, the formula needed is more complex and involves the geometry of the \(2n\)-gon inscribed in a square. The correct formula for the side length \(s\) of the smallest square that can contain a \(2n\)-gon is given by:

\[ s = \frac{2}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \]

This formula ensures that the \(2n\)-gon, when rotated appropriately, fits within the square without exceeding its boundaries.

However, the current implementation in `func_1` uses:

\[ \text{result} = \frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \]

This formula does not represent the correct geometric relationship for the problem at hand. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Why it is Incorrect:

- **Incorrect Formula**: The provided formula in `func_1` does not compute the correct side length of the square needed to embed the \(2n\)-gon.
- **Lack of Proper Geometric Consideration**: The problem requires considering the geometry of the \(2n\)-gon inscribed in a square, which is not captured by the current formula.

In summary, the program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct mathematical relationship for determining the minimum side length of the square that can embed the \(2n\)-gon.
