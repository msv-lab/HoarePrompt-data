Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the minimum side length of a square that can embed a 2n-gon using the formula `cos(π / (4 * n)) / sin(π / (2 * n))`. However, this formula is incorrect for the problem description. The formula provided in the solution is derived for even \( n \), but the problem specifies that \( n \) is always odd.

For odd \( n \), the formula needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the correct formula for the minimum side length of the square that can embed a 2n-gon (where \( n \) is odd) is different from the one provided.

To illustrate, consider \( n = 3 \) (a hexagon):

- The correct side length of the square should be \( 1.931851653 \), but the program outputs the same value for both even and odd \( n \).

Thus, the program does not handle the case where \( n \) is odd correctly, making it incorrect.
