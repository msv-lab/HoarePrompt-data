Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum side length of a square that can embed a 2n-gon. The formula used in `func_1` is not correct for determining the minimum side length of the square for a given odd \( n \).

The correct approach involves understanding the geometry of the 2n-gon and its relationship with the inscribed circle. For a regular 2n-gon with unit side lengths, the minimum side length \( s \) of the square that can contain it can be derived from the relationship involving the circumradius \( R \) of the 2n-gon and the properties of the polygon.

The correct formula for the minimum side length \( s \) of the square is:

\[ s = 2R \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) \]

where \( R \) is the circumradius of the 2n-gon. Given that the side length of the 2n-gon is 1, the circumradius \( R \) can be calculated using the formula for the circumradius of a regular polygon:

\[ R = \frac{1}{2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \]

Substituting \( R \) into the formula for \( s \):

\[ s = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right) = 1 \]

However, this is not the complete solution. The actual formula considering the geometry of the 2n-gon and the inscribed circle is more complex and involves the cosine term as well. The correct formula is:

\[ s = \frac{1}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \]

The provided code uses:

\[ s = \frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)} \]

This formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the geometry of the 2n-gon. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
