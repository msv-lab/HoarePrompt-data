Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code functionality. The program uses the formula \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\) to calculate the minimum side length of the square needed to embed a 2n-gon. However, this formula is incorrect for odd values of \(n\). The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` is designed to work with odd integers \(n\) within the specified range, but it does not account for the geometric properties of the polygon correctly. As illustrated by the example for \(n = 3\), the calculated value does not match the expected result. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct for the given problem description.
