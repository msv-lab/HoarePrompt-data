Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program uses a formula that is derived for even \( n \) but the problem specifies that \( n \) is always odd. The formula \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\) is incorrect for odd \( n \). The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` assumes \( n \) is always an odd integer within the specified range, but the formula itself is not correct for the given problem description. Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of the square for odd \( n \), leading to incorrect results.
