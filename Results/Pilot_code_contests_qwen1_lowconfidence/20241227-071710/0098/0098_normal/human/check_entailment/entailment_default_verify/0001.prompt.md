You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C1. The only difference is that, in problem C1, n is always even, and in C2, n is always odd.

You are given a regular polygon with 2 ⋅ n vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length 1. Let's name it as 2n-gon.

Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed 2n-gon in the square. Embedding 2n-gon in the square means that you need to place 2n-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of 2n-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square.

You can rotate 2n-gon and/or the square.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 200) — the number of test cases.

Next T lines contain descriptions of test cases — one per line. Each line contains single odd integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 199). Don't forget you need to embed 2n-gon, not an n-gon.

Output

Print T real numbers — one per test case. For each test case, print the minimum length of a side of the square 2n-gon can be embedded in. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{-6}.

    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum side length of the square needed to embed a 2n-gon. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect for odd values of `n`. 

For a regular polygon with \(2n\) vertices, the minimum side length of the square required to embed it can be derived from the geometry of the polygon. The formula provided in the solution uses a cosine and sine function that does not account for the fact that \(n\) is odd. 

To illustrate the issue, consider the case when \(n = 3\):

- For \(n = 3\), we have a hexagon (6-sided polygon).
- The correct minimum side length of the square to embed a regular hexagon is \(\sqrt{3}\), which is approximately 1.732050808.
- However, the program calculates the value using the given function, which results in approximately 1.931851653, which is incorrect.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not handle the case where \(n\) is odd correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts an odd integer `n` within the range 3 to 199 (inclusive). It calculates and returns the value of \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\). There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code, but the function assumes that `n` is always an odd integer within the specified range. If `n` is not an odd integer or falls outside the range, the behavior is undefined based on the given code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
