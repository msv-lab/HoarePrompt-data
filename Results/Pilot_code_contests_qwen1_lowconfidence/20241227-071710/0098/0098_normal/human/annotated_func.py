#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)) where n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an odd integer `n` within the range 3 to 199 (inclusive). It calculates and returns the value of \(\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}\). There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code, but the function assumes that `n` is always an odd integer within the specified range. If `n` is not an odd integer or falls outside the range, the behavior is undefined based on the given code.
