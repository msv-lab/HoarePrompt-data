Precondition: **n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12. The first line contains n pairs of integers representing pairs communicated from the first participant to the second, and the second line contains m pairs of integers representing pairs communicated from the second participant to the first. Each pair consists of two distinct integers between 1 and 9.**
