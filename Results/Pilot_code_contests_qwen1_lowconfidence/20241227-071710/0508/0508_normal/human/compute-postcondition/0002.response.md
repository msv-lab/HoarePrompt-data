The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list is assigned to `p2`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `p2` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
