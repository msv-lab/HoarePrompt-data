The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, it does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is p1[2 * i]; `b` is p1[2 * i + 1]; `c` is p2[2 * j]; `d` is p2[2 * j + 1]; `a` is in (c, d) and `b` is in (c, d)**
