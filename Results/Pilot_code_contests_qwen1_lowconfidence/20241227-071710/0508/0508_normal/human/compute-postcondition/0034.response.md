The code snippet `cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `cand` was initially the value of `kandidat`, adding `kandidat` again does not change the set `cand`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

- `m` must be greater than 0
- `a` is `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`
- `c` is `p2[2 * j]`
- `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`
- `kandidat` is the value of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition
- `cand` contains the value of `kandidat` (i.e., the set containing only `kandidat`)
- `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`
- `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`
- `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is the value of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`; the values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively.**
