Postcondition: ***`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`. If both `a` and `b` are not in `(c, d)`, the conditions for `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j + 1]` remain unchanged.***
