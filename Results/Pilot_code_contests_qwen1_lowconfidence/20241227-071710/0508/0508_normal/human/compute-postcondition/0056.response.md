The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`**
