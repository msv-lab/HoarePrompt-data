According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Additionally, we need to consider the initial states of the variables involved, which include `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i + 1]`, and `dd[j]`.

Given the initial states:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is the value of `p1[2 * (i + 1)]`.
- `b` is the value of `p1[2 * (i + 1) + 1]`.
- `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`.
- `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`.
- `kandidat` is the last value that met the condition within the loop.
- `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values encountered during all iterations.
- `cc[i + 1]` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `i + 1` where the loop ends.
- `dd[j]` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `j` where the loop ended for the last iteration.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1, and since `j` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, the loop will start with `j = 0` and continue as long as `j < m`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` must be 0 initially.

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
