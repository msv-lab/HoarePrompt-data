Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is p1[2 * i]; `b` is p1[2 * i + 1]; `c` is p2[2 * j]; `d` is p2[2 * j + 1]; if `a` is in (c, d), the conditions remain as is. Otherwise, no changes are specified for these variables.***

Explanation: The postcondition includes all the information from the precondition and adds the condition specified in the if statement. Since the if statement checks if `a` is in the range `(c, d)`, the postcondition reflects this by stating that if this condition is met, the existing values remain unchanged.
