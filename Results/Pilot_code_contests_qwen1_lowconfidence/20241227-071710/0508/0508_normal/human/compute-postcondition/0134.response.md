The code assigns `a` to `kandidat`. The value of `a` is not specified directly, but it is known that `kandidat` was either `a` if `a` is in the interval `(p2[4], p2[5])` or `b` if `a` is not in the interval `(p2[4], p5)`. Since `kandidat` is now explicitly set to `a`, the value of `kandidat` is `a`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `kandidat` is `a`, `cand` contains `a`, `cc[0]` contains `a`, `cc[1]` contains `a`, `dd[0]` contains `a`, `dd[1]` contains `a`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`.**
