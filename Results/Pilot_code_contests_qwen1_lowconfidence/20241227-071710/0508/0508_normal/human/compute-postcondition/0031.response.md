The code `kandidat = a` assigns the value of `a` to `kandidat`. The value of `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, and since `kandidat` was previously determined by whether `a` or `b` is in the interval `(c, d)`, this assignment does not change the truth value of `kandidat` based on the interval check. However, `kandidat` now explicitly holds the value of `a`.

The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is the value of `a`; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{a}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {a}`; the values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively.
