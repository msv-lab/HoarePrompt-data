The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, the `continue` statement does not modify any variable values. The conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is p1[2 * i]; `b` is p1[2 * i + 1]; `c` is p2[2 * j]; `d` is p2[2 * j + 1]; `a` is not in (c, d) and `b` is not in (c, d)**
