`dd[j].add(kandidat)` adds the `kandidat` to the set `dd[j]`. The value of `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`. Since `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]` and `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, and `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`, the only change is that `kandidat` is added to `dd[j]`.

Output State: **`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[j]` includes `kandidat`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`**.
