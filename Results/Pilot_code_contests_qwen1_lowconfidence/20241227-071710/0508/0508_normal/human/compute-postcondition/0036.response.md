`dd[j]` has the method `add(kandidat)` called on it, which adds the value of `kandidat` to the set stored in `dd[j]`. The value of `kandidat` is already part of the set `cc[i]` and `dd[j + 1]`, but adding it to `dd[j]` will ensure it is present in `dd[j]` as well. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is the value of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`; the values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively.**
