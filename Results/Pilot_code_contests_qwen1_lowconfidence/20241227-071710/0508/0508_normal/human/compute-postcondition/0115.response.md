The code snippet assigns `p1[2 * i]` to `a` and `p1[2 * i + 1]` to `b`. The values of `p1`, `i`, and the conditions involving `a`, `b`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `a` and `b`. However, we know that `a` and `b` will be assigned the values from `p1` at indices `2 * i` and `2 * i + 1` respectively.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval (c, d) or `b` if `a` is not in the interval (c, d) and `b` is also not in the interval (c, d), `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`**
