The code `cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds the `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. Since `kandidat` is already a member of the set, adding it again does not change the set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`.**
