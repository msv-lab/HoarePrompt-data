The code updates the values of `c` and `d` to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` respectively. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, `dd[j + 1]`, or the conditions involving them. 

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; if `a` is in (c, d), `kandidat` is equal to `a`; otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}; c` is now `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`.**
