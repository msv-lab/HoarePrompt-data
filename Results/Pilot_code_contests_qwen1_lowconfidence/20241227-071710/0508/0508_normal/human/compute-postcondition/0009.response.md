The code assigns values from `p2` to `c` and `d`. Specifically, `c` gets the value of `p2[2 * j]` and `d` gets the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is p1[2 * i]; `b` is p1[2 * i + 1]; `c` is p2[2 * j]; `d` is p2[2 * j + 1]**
