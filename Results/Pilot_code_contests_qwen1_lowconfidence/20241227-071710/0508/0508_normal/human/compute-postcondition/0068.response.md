`dd[j]` is a set, and the code adds `kandidat` to this set. Based on the initial state, `kandidat` is defined as either `a` if `a` is in `(c, d)` and `b` is in `(c, d)`, or `b` if `a` is not in `(c, d)` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`. This does not change the initial conditions for `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, or `cc[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in `(c, d)` and `b` is in `(c, d)`, or `b` if `a` is not in `(c, d)` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`; `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`; `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`; `dd[j]` is a set that now includes `kandidat`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in `(c, d)` and `b` is in `(c, d)`, or `b` if `a` is not in `(c, d)` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`; `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`; `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`; `dd[j]` is a set that includes `kandidat`**.
