The code `cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. The initial state provides the following information:
- `m > 0`
- `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`
- `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`
- `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`
- `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`
- `cand` contains `kandidat`

Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and `cc[i]` is a set (sets do not allow duplicate elements), adding `kandidat` to `cc[i]` will add the value of `kandidat` to the set if it is not already present.

Output State: **`m > 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]; `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`**
