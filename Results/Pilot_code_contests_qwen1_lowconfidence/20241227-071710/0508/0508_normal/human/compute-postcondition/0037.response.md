According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions are met:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- `c` is `p2[2 * j]`.
- `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`.
- `kandidat` is the value of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition.
- `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`.
- `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`.
- `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`.
- `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`.
- The values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and the new state must satisfy the condition that `j` is still less than `m`.

So, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- `m` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
- `a` remains `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` remains `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- `c` is updated to `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`.
- `d` is updated to `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`.
- `kandidat` is determined based on the condition (either `a` or `b`).
- `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`.
- `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`.
- `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}` (this remains unchanged from the previous state).
- `dd[j]` is updated to `dd[j] + {kandidat}`.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`, `d` is `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`, `kandidat` is the value of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition, `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`, `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`, `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`**.
