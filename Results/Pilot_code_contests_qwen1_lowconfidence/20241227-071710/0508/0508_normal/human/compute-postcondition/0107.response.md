`kandidat` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of `m` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is in the interval (c, d), `kandidat` equals `a`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is in the interval (c, d), `kandidat` equals `a`**
