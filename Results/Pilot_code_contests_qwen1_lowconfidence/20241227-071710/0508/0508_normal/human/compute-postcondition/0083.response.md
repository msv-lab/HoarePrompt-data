The code snippet `a, b = p1[2 * i], p1[2 * i + 1]` assigns the value of `p1[2 * i]` to `a` and the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]` to `b`. This directly impacts the values of `a` and `b`.

- Initially, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]` and `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- After the code execution, `a` is updated to the value of `p1[2 * i]` and `b` is updated to the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged: `m > 0`, `c` is now `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`.

Output State: **`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`**
