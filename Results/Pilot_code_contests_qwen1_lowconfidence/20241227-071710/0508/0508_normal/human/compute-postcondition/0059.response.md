The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and relationships between the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `a` is in `(c, d)` and `b` is in `(c, d)`**
