`kandidat` is reassigned the value of `b`. The previous value of `a` is no longer relevant since `kandidat` now holds the value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is `b`, `cand` contains the value of `b`, `cc[i]` contains the set `{b}`, `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {b}`, `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {b}`.
