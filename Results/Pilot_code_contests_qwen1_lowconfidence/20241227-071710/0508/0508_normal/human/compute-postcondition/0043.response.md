Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`, `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`, `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`. Since the `continue` statement is not within any loop, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of whether the if condition is met.**
