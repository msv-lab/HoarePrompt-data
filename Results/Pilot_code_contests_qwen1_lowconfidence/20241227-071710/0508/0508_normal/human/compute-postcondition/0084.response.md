The code `c, d = p2[2 * j], p2[2 * j + 1]` updates the values of `c` and `d`. Initially, `c` is `p2[2 * (j + 1)]` and `d` is `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`. After the code execution, `c` is updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `d` is updated to `p2[2 * j + 1]`.

The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, `dd[j + 1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`**
