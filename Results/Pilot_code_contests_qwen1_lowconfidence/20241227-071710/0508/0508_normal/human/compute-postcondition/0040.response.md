The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, `dd[j]`, and `dd[j + 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is the value of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition, `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`, `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`, `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`**
