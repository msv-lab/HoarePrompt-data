The code `print(cand.pop())` removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set `cand`. Given that the initial state of `cand` is a set containing exactly one element, after the `pop()` method is called, `cand` will be an empty set. The value that was popped (and printed) is not explicitly stored or used in further calculations within the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `cand` is now an empty set.
- A value from `cand` has been printed (but the specific value is not retained).

Output State: **`cand` is an empty set, a value from `cand` has been printed**
