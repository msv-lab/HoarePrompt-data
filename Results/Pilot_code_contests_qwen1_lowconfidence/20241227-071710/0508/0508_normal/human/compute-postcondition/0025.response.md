The code `a, b = p1[2 * i], p1[2 * i + 1]` assigns the value of `p1[2 * i]` to `a` and the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]` to `b`. This directly updates the values of `a` and `b` without affecting other variables.

Given the initial conditions:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is initially `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` is initially `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- `c` is `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`.
- `d` is `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`.
- If `a` is in (c, d), `kandidat` is equal to `a`; otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`.
- `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`.
- `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`.
- `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`.

After executing the code:
- `a` is updated to `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` is updated to `p1[2 * i + 1]`.

The states of `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j + 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; if `a` is in (c, d), `kandidat` is equal to `a`; otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`.**
