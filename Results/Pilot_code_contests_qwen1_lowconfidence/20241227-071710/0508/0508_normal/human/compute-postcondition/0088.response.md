Postcondition: ***`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`. Since the if condition `a in (c, d) and b in (c, d)` is met, the loop continues and these conditions remain unchanged.***
