`kandidat` is assigned the value of `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `m`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `a` is not in `(c, d)` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`, `kandidat` is `b`**
