Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `m` is greater than 0
- `j` is 0
- `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval (c, d) or `b` if `a` is not in the interval (c, d) and `b` is also not in the interval (c, d)
- `cand` contains `kandidat`
- `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`
- `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`.
2. **Current Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from 0 to 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1.

### Updated States:
- `m` remains the same and is still greater than 0.
- `j` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[0]`, and `dd[0]` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications to these variables are specified.

### Final State:
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval (c, d) or `b` if `a` is not in the interval (c, d) and `b` is also not in the interval (c, d), `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, and `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`**
