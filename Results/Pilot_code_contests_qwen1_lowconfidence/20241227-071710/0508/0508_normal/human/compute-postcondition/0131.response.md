Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval `(p2[4], p2[5])`, or `b` if `a` is not in the interval `(p2[5], p2[4])`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`. If `a` is not in the interval `(p2[4], p2[5])` and `b` is not in the interval `(p2[4], p2[5])`, the condition remains unchanged.***
