The code assigns `p2[2 * j]` to `c` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` to `d`. The values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `p1` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`**
