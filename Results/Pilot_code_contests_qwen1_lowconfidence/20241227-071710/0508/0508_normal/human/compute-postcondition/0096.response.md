According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though this does not affect the loop directly).
- `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`.
- `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`.
- `kandidat` is the last value that met the condition within the loop.
- `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values encountered during all iterations.
- `cc[i]` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `i` where the loop ended.
- `dd[j]` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `j` where the loop ended for the last iteration.

For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`. Therefore, `i` should now be `i + 1`.

Since `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again, `i` becomes `i + 1`, and `n` remains unchanged. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc`, and `dd`) remain the same because they are not affected by the increment of `i`.

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * (i + 1)]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * (i + 1) + 1]`, `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is the last value that met the condition within the loop, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values encountered during all iterations, `cc[i + 1]` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `i + 1` where the loop ends, `dd[j]` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `j` where the loop ended for the last iteration.**
