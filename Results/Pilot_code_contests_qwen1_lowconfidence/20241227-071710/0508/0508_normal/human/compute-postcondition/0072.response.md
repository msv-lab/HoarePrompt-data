The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this context, since no changes are made to any variables and the loop simply continues, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The states of the variables are as follows:

- `m` must be greater than 0
- `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`
- `c` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`
- `d` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`
- `kandidat` is either `a` if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, or `b` if either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`
- `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`
- `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`
- `dd[j + 1]` is a set that includes `kandidat`
- `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`
- `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`
- `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`

Since no variables are updated or changed, the only additional information is that the loop continues.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, or `b` if either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`; `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`; `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`; `dd[j + 1]` is a set that includes `kandidat`; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; the loop continues.**
