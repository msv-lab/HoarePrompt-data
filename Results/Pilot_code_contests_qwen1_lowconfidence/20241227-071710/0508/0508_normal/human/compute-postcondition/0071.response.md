The code updates the values of `c` and `d` to be `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, or `b` if either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`; `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`; `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`; `dd[j + 1]` is a set that includes `kandidat`; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`**
