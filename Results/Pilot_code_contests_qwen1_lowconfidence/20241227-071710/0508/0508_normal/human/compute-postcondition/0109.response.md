`kandidat` is assigned the value of `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is not in the interval `(c, d)`, `b` is not in the interval `(c, d)`, `kandidat` is equal to `b`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is not in the interval `(c, d)`, `b` is not in the interval `(c, d)`, `kandidat` is equal to `b`**
