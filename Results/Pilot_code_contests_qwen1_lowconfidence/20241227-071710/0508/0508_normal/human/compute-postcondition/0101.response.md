The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. The states of the variables `m`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and the conditions involving these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`, `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`.**
