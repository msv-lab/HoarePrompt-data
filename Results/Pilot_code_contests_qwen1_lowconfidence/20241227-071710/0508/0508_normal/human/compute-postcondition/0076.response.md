The code `kandidat = a` assigns the value of `a` to `kandidat`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; `kandidat` is `a`; `cand` is a set containing `a`; `cc[i]` is a set containing `a`; `dd[j + 1]` is a set that includes `a`; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`.**
