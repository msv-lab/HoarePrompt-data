The code `cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. Given that `i` is 1 (as per the initial state), this means `cc[1]` will now contain `kandidat`. The value of `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval `(p2[2], p2[3])`, or `b` if `a` is not in that interval.

Therefore, `cc[1]` will contain `kandidat`, which is either `a` or `b`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval (`p2[2]`, `p2[3]`), or `b` if `a` is not in the interval (`p2[3]`, `p2[2]`), `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`**
