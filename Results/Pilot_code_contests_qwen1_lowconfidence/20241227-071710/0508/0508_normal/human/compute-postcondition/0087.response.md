The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Given the initial state, the conditions for `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j + 1]` remain unchanged unless `a` and `b` are not in `(c, d)`, which is not specified to change anything here.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`.
