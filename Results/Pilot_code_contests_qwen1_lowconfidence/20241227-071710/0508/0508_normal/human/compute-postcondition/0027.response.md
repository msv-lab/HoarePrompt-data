The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. This means that the value of the variable `kandidat` and its associated sets `cc[i]` and `dd[j + 1]` remain unchanged. Additionally, the values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively. 

The output state will reflect these changes:

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is the value determined by whether `a` is in (c, d); `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`; the values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively.**
