The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `m`, `j`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[0]`, `dd[0]`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval (`p2[2]`, `p2[3]`) or `b` if `a` is not in the interval (`p2[3]`, `p2[2]`) and `b` is also not in the interval (`p2[3]`, `p2[2]`), `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`**
