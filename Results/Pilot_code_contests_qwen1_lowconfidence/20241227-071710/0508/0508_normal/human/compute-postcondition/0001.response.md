The code `p1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p1`. Since the initial values of `n` and `m` are obtained from input and are between 1 and 12, the output state will reflect that `p1` now contains the integers from the input, while `n` and `m` remain their original values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer between 1 and 12, `p1` is a list containing integers obtained from the input**
