Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]` for the last iteration, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]` for the last iteration, `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]` for the last iteration, `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]` for the last iteration, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b` based on the conditions checked during the last iteration, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values encountered during all iterations, `cc[i]` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `i` where the loop ended, `dd[j]` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `j` where the loop ended for the last iteration.**
