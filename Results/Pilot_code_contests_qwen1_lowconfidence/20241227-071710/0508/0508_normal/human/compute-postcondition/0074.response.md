The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no specific values or changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement, the variables retain their previous states. The precondition remains valid.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, or `b` if either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`; `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`; `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`; `dd[j + 1]` is a set that includes `kandidat`; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; the loop continues.**
