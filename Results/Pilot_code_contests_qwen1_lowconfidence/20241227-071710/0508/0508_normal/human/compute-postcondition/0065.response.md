Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in `(c, d)` and `b` is in `(c, d)`, or `b` if `a` is not in `(c, d)` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`***
