Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`; if `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, these conditions remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is solely dependent on the if condition.***
