Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is the value of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`; the values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively.***
