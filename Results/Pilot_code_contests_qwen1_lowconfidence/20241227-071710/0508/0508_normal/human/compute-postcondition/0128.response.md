The code assigns `p1[2 * i]` to `a` and `p1[2 * i + 1]` to `b`. The values of `p1[2 * i]` and `p1[2 * i + 1]` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unknown. The values of `j`, `m`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval `(p2[2], p2[3])`, or `b` if `a` is not in the interval `(p2[3], p2[2])`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`**
