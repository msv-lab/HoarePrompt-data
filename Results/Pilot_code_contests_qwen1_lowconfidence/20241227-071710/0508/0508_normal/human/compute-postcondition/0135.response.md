The code `kandidat = b` assigns the value `b` to the variable `kandidat`. This assignment updates the value of `kandidat` from its previous state (which was determined by whether `a` was in the interval `(p2[4], p2[5])` or not). Now, regardless of the original value of `kandidat`, it is explicitly set to `b`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated states are:
- `j` is 2
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `kandidat` is `b`
- `cand` contains `kandidat`, which is `b`
- `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, which is `b`
- `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`, which is `b`
- `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, which is `b`
- `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`, which is `b`
- `c` is `p2[4]`
- `d` is `p2[5]`

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `kandidat` is `b`, `cand` is `b`, `cc[0]` is `b`, `cc[1]` is `b`, `dd[0]` is `b`, `dd[1]` is `b`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`**
