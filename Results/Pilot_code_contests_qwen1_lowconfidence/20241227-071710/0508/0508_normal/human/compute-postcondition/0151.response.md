The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it reads input from the user, specifically:
- `n` pairs of integers from the first line representing pairs communicated from the first participant to the second, where each pair consists of two distinct integers between 1 and 9.
- `m` pairs of integers from the second line representing pairs communicated from the second participant to the first, where each pair consists of two distinct integers between 1 and 9.

The function then processes this input and returns a value based on the provided conditions. However, since the specific output is not detailed in the problem statement, we can only describe the input acceptance.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads `n` pairs of integers from the first line representing pairs communicated from the first participant to the second, and `m` pairs of integers from the second line representing pairs communicated from the second participant to the first.**
