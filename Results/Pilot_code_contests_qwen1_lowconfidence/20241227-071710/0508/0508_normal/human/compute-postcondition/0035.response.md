`cc[i]` is a set that contains the value of `kandidat`. The line of code `cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. Since `kandidat` is already in the set, adding it again does not change the set. The values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively, but this is not affected by the current line of code.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is the value of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`; the values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively.**
