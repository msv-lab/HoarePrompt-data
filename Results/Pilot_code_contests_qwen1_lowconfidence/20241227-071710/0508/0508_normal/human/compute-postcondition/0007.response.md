According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1 because the `range(m)` function generates numbers from 0 to `m-1`. Since the initial state is given as `n` must be greater than 0, this state does not directly affect the execution of the current for loop. The loop's execution condition is solely based on `m`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `m` is greater than 0.

State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
