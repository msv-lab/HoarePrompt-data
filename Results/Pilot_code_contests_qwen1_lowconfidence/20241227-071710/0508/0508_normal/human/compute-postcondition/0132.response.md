The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect the values of any variables or change the conditions of the loop or if-else statements. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop or continues to the next condition in the if-else structure.

Given the initial state, the only thing that happens is that the loop or if-else structure will skip to the next iteration or condition, but no new assignments or changes to the variables occur.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval `(p2[4], p2[5])`, or `b` if `a` is not in the interval `(p2[5], p4)`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop or next condition in the if-else structure.**
