Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `p1` is a list of integers, `p2` is a list of integers, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values that meet the specified conditions during all iterations, `cc` is a list of `n` sets where each set contains all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `i` where the loop ends for the last iteration, `dd` is a list of `m` sets where each set contains all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `j` where the loop ends for the last iteration. The current size of `cand` is 1.***
