Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is the value determined by whether `a` or `b` is in the interval `(c, d)`, depending on the conditions specified in the if statement; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`; the values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively. If both `a` and `b` are within the interval `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` is true and sets are updated accordingly. If either `a` or `b` is not within the interval `(c, d)`, then `kandidat` remains unchanged and sets are updated according to the if condition.***
