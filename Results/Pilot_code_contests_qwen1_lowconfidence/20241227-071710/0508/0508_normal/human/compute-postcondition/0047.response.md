`cand` is a set that already contains the value of `kandidat`. The line of code adds `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and `cand` already contains `kandidat`, adding `kandidat` again does not change the contents of `cand`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`, `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`, `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`, depending on whether `a` is in the set `{c, d}` or not.**
