Postcondition: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval (`p2[2]`, `p2[3]`) or `b` if `a` is not in the interval (`p2[3]`, `p2[2]`) and `b` is also not in the interval (`p2[3]`, `p2[2]`), `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`. If both `a` and `b` are not in the interval (`p2[2]`, `p2[3]`), then the conditions `m > 0`, `j == 1`, and the states of `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[0]`, and `dd[0]` remain unchanged.**
