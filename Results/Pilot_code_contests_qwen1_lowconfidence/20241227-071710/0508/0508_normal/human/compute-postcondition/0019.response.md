The code `kandidat = b` assigns the value of `b` to the variable `kandidat`. The initial values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state includes the new assignment for `kandidat`.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is p1[2 * i]; `b` is p1[2 * i + 1]; `c` is p2[2 * j]; `d` is p2[2 * j + 1]; `a` is not in (c, d) or `b` is not in (c, d); `kandidat` is `b`**
