Functionality: **The function reads two sets of pairs of integers from the standard input. Each set of pairs represents communications between two participants. For each pair from the first participant, it checks if there is a common element with any pair from the second participant. It then collects these common elements into a set called `cand`. After processing all pairs, the function determines whether there is exactly one common element in `cand`. If there is, it prints this element. Otherwise, it checks if any of the participant's sets (`cc` or `dd`) have more than one common element. If all sets have at most one common element, it prints 0. In all other cases, it prints -1. The function does not accept any explicit parameters but relies on the input provided through `raw_input()`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
1. If the input does not contain `n` pairs of integers followed by `m` pairs, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to incorrect input format.
2. If any of the integers in the pairs exceed the specified range (1 to 9), the function does not handle this case and may produce unexpected results.
3. The function assumes that all integers in the pairs are within the valid range and do not check for this explicitly, which could lead to errors if invalid data is provided.
