`cc[i].add(kandidat)` adds the `kandidat` to the set `cc[i]`. Since `kandidat` is already a member of `cc[i]`, adding it again does not change the set. However, the operation itself is performed, and the state of `cc[i]` is updated to include `kandidat`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`, `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`, `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`, `cc[i]` now includes `kandidat`.**
