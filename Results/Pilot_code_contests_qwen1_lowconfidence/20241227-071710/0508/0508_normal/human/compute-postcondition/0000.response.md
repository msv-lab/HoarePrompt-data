The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and splits them using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that `n` and `m` are now the integers obtained from the input, and their original values as non-negative integers between 1 and 12 are preserved.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input, and they are between 1 and 12.**
