The code sets `kandidat` to the value of `a`. Since `a` is already defined as `p1[2 * i]`, this assignment updates the value of `kandidat`. The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is now `a`, `cand` contains `a`, `cc[i]` contains `a`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `a`.**
