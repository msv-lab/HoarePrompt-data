The code sets `kandidat` to `b`. According to the precondition, `kandidat` was previously determined to be either `a` if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, or `b` if either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`. Since the code simply reassigns `kandidat` to `b`, the condition under which `kandidat` would have been set to `a` is no longer relevant for this step. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; `kandidat` is `b`; `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`; `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`; `dd[j + 1]` is a set that includes `kandidat`; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`.**
