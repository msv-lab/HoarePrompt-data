The code `cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and `cand` initially contains `kandidat`, adding `kandidat` again does not change its contents. However, it's important to note that sets in Python only store unique elements, so repeating an element does not add it again.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`.**
