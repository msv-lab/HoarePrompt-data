The code assigns `b` to `kandidat`. Given the precondition, the values of `m`, `j`, `cand`, `cc[0]`, and `dd[0]` remain unchanged. The value of `kandidat` is updated to `b`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `kandidat` is `b`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`**
