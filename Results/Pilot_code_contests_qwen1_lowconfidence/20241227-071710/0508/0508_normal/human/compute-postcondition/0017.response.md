`kandidat` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `j`, `b`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; if `a` is in (c, d), the conditions remain as is; `kandidat` is equal to `a`.
