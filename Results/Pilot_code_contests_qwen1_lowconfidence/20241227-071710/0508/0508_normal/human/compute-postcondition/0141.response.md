Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `p1` is a list of integers, `p2` is a list of integers, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values that meet the specified conditions during all iterations, `cc` is a list of `n` sets where each set contains all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `i` where the loop ends for the last iteration, `dd` is a list of `m` sets where each set contains all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `j` where the loop ends for the last iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all possible combinations of indices `i` and `j` where `0 ≤ i < n` and `0 ≤ j < m`.
- For each combination, it checks whether `a` and `b` (values from `p1`) are neither in the pair `(c, d)` nor both in the pair `(c, d)`. If they meet one of the conditions, `kandidat` is determined and added to the sets `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j]`.
- After all iterations, `cand` will contain all unique `kandidat` values that were added during any of the iterations.
- `cc[i]` will contain all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `i` where the loop ended for the last iteration.
- `dd[j]` will contain all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `j` where the loop ended for the last iteration.
- Since the loop iterates over all valid pairs `(i, j)`, if the loop does not execute at all, `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` will remain in their initial states (i.e., `cand` will be an empty set, and `cc` and `dd` will be lists of `n` and `m` empty sets, respectively).
