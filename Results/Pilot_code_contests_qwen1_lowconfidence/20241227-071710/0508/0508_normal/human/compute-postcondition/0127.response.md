Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval `(p2[2], p2[3])`, or `b` if `a` is not in the interval `(p2[3], p2[2])`.
- `cand` contains `kandidat`.
- `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`.
- `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`.
- `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.
- `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition `j < m` must hold true for the loop to execute again.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2 and `m` must still be greater than 0.

2. **Adjusting States:**
   - `j` must be incremented by 1 from 1 to 2.
   - `m` must remain greater than 0 (as it was at the end of the previous iteration).

3. **Other Variables:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we assume that other variables like `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` do not change within the loop. Thus, their values remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `j` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval `(p2[2], p2[3])`, or `b` if `a` is not in the interval `(p2[3], p2[2])`.
- `cand` contains `kandidat`.
- `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`.
- `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`.
- `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`.
- `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval `(p2[2], p2[3])`, or `b` if `a` is not in the interval `(p2[3], p2[2])`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`**
