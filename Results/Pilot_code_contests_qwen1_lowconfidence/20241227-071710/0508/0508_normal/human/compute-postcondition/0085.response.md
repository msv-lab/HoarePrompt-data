The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Given that no loop is mentioned in the code snippet, and `continue` is used, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m > 0`, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`**
