The code `c, d = p2[2 * j], p2[2 * j + 1]` updates the values of `c` and `d`. Initially, `c` was `p2[2 * (j + 1)]` and `d` was `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`. After executing the code, `c` is now `p2[2 * j]` and `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`.

The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j]` and `dd[j + 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is the value of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition, `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`, `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`, `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`**
