The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `m`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`. Both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`**
