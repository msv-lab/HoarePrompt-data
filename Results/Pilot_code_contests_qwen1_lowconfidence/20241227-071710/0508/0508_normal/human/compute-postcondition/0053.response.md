The code `a, b = p1[2 * i], p1[2 * i + 1]` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` was the value of `p1[2 * (i + 1)]` and `b` was the value of `p1[2 * (i + 1) + 1]`. After executing the code, `a` is now assigned the value of `p1[2 * i]` and `b` is assigned the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`. The values of `m`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`**
