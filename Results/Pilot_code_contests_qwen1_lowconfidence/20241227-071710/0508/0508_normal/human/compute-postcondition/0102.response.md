Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[0]`, `d` is `p2[1]`. If `a` is not in `(c, d)` and `b` is not in `(c, d)`, the conditions remain as they are. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is determined solely by the if condition.***
