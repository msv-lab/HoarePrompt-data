To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to consider the loop's initialization and condition:

1. The loop uses `range(n)`, meaning the loop will iterate `n` times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i < n`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 12.
- `m` is an integer between 1 and 12.
- `p2` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cand` is an empty set.
- `cc` is a list of `n` empty sets.
- `dd` is a list of `m` empty sets.

The critical state to adjust is `n` because it determines the number of iterations in the loop. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0 (or at least 1) for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
