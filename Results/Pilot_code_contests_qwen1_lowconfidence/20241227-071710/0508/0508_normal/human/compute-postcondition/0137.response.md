The code `cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, the set `cand` will now contain both `a` and `b` if `kandidat` was added twice, or just one of them if it was added once.

Other variables are not affected, so their values remain as in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b` (or both), `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`.**
