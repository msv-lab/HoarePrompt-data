`dd[j]` is accessed, which is `dd[2]` since `j` is 2. The `add` method is called on this element to add `kandidat`. Since `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, and `dd[2]` already contains `kandidat` (as per the initial state), adding `kandidat` again does not change its value in `dd[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` is a set containing either `a` or `b` (or both), `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[2]` contains `kandidat`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`**
