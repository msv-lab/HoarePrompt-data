The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, in this case, the given code snippet is outside of any loop, which means that the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`, `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`, `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`.
