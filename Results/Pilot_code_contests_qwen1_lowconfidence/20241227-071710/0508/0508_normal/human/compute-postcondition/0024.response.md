According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `j` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `a` is `p1[2 * i]`
- `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`
- `c` is `p2[2 * j]`
- `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`
- If `a` is in (c, d), `kandidat` is equal to `a`; otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`
- `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`
- `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`
- `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be less than `m`
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `j` will become `j + 1`
- Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than `m`

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; if `a` is in (c, d), `kandidat` is equal to `a`; otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`.**
