The code assigns the values from `p2` to `c` and `d` based on the index `2 * j`. Since `j` is initially 2, the indices `2 * j` and `2 * j + 1` become 4 and 5, respectively.

The initial values for `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc`, and `dd` depend on the value of `a`. Given the conditions, `a` is `p1[2 * i]` and `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`. However, these specific values of `a` and `b` do not affect the values of `c` and `d` directly in this snippet of code.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `c` is assigned the value of `p2[4]`.
2. `d` is assigned the value of `p2[5]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval `(p2[4], p2[5])`, or `b` if `a` is not in the interval `(p2[5], p2[4])`, `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `cc[1]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[1]` contains `kandidat`, `c` is `p2[4]`, `d` is `p2[5]`**
