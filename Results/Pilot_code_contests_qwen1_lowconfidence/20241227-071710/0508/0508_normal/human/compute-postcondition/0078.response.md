Postcondition: ***`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; if `a` is within the range `(c, d)`, `kandidat` is set to `a`, and the sets `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j + 1]` are updated accordingly; otherwise, `kandidat` is set to `b`, and the sets `cand`, `cc[i]`, and `dd[j + 1]` are updated accordingly; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`, and `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`, while `a` remains the value of `p1[2 * i]` and `b` remains the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`.***
