`cand.add(kandidat)` adds the value of `kandidat` to the set `cand`. The value of `kandidat` is determined based on whether `a` is within the range `(c, d)`. If `a` is within this range, `kandidat` is equal to `a`, otherwise, `kandidat` is equal to `b`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and the exact nature of `kandidat` is dependent on these values, we can only state that `kandidat` will be added to the set `cand`. The other variables (`m`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; if `a` is in (c, d), `kandidat` is equal to `a`; otherwise, `kandidat` is `b`; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`**
