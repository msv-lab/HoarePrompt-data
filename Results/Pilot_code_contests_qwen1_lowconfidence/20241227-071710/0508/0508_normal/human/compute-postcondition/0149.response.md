Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `p1` is a list of integers, `p2` is a list of integers, `cand` is a set containing all unique `kandidat` values that meet the specified conditions during all iterations, `cc` is a list of `n` sets where each set contains all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `i` where the loop ends for the last iteration, `dd` is a list of `m` sets where each set contains all unique `kandidat` values for the specific `j` where the loop ends for the last iteration, and the length of `cand` is not equal to 1, and either the maximum length of any set in `cc` is less than or equal to 1 and the maximum length of any set in `dd` is less than or equal to 1, or at least one of the following is true: `max((len(cc[i]) for i in range(n))) > 1` or `max((len(dd[i]) for i in range(m))) > 1; -1 is printed.**
