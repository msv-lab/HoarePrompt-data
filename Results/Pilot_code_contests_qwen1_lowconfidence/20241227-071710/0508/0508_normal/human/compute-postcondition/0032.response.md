The code assigns the value of `b` directly to `kandidat`. This means `kandidat` now holds the value of `b`. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `c`, `d`, `kandidat`, `cand`, `cc[i]`, `dd[j + 1]`) are not directly affected by this line of code other than updating `kandidat`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is `b`; `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`; `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`; the values of `c` and `d` are updated to `p2[2 * j]` and `p2[2 * j + 1]`, respectively.**
