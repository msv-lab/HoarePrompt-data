Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2 * j]`, `d` is `p2[2 * j + 1]`, `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, `cand` contains the value of `kandidat`, `cc[i]` contains the set `{kandidat}`, `dd[j]` contains the set `dd[j] + {kandidat}`, `dd[j + 1]` contains the set `dd[j + 1] + {kandidat}`, depending on whether `a` is in the set `{c, d}` or not. If `a` is in the set `{c, d}`, `kandidat` is `a`; otherwise, `kandidat` is reassigned to `b`.**
