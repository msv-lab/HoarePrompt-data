Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`.
- `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`.
- `kandidat` is either `a` if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, or `b` if either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`.
- `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`.
- `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`.
- `dd[j]` is a set that includes `kandidat`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs as long as `j < m`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to continue. Since the loop is iterating over `range(m)`, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

2. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is an upper limit.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain the same as they are determined based on the values in `p1` and `p2` and do not change within the loop.
   - `kandidat` is recalculated based on the new values of `c` and `d` in the next iteration.
   - `cand` is updated to include the new `kandidat`.
   - `cc[i]` is updated to include the new `kandidat`.
   - `dd[j + 1]` is initialized to include the new `kandidat`.

### Final State:
- `m` must still be greater than 0.
- `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`.
- `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
- `c` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`.
- `d` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`.
- `kandidat` is either `a` if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, or `b` if either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`.
- `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`.
- `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`.
- `dd[j + 1]` is a set that includes `kandidat`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`; `kandidat` is either `a` if both `a` and `b` are in `(c, d)`, or `b` if either `a` or `b` is not in `(c, d)`; `cand` is a set containing `kandidat`; `cc[i]` is a set containing `kandidat`; `dd[j + 1]` is a set that includes `kandidat`**
