`dd[j]` is updated to include the value of `kandidat`. The value of `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`, which means it could be `p1[2 * i]` or `p1[2 * i + 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m > 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]; `c` is now `p2[2 * j]; `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j]` includes `kandidat`**
