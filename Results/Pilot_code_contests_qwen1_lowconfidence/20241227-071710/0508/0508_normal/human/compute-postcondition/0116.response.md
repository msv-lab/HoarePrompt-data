The code assigns the values from `p2[2 * j]` to `c` and `p2[2 * j + 1]` to `d`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so we substitute `j` with 1 in the expressions for `c` and `d`.

- `c` is assigned the value `p2[2 * 1]`, which is `p2[2]`.
- `d` is assigned the value `p2[2 * 1 + 1]`, which is `p2[3]`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `kandidat` is either `a` if `a` is in the interval (`p2[2]`, `p2[3]`) or `b` if `a` is not in the interval (`p2[2]`, `p2[3]`) and `b` is also not in the interval (`p2[2]`, `p2[3]`), `cand` contains `kandidat`, `cc[0]` contains `kandidat`, `dd[0]` contains `kandidat`, `a` is `p1[2 * i]`, `b` is `p1[2 * i + 1]`, `c` is `p2[2]`, `d` is `p2[3]`**
