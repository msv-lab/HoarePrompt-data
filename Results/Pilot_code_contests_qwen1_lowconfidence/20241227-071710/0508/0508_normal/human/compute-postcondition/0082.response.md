Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m > 0`: This means `m` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`.
   - `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`.
   - `c` is now `p2[2 * j]`.
   - `d` is now `p2[2 * j + 1]`.
   - `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`.
   - `cand` contains `kandidat`.
   - `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`.
   - `dd[j]` includes `kandidat`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `range(m)`. 

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs based on `j`, we need to increment `j` by 1 to move to the next iteration.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` was such that `0 <= j < m-1` (since `j` starts from 0).
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1`, ensuring that `0 <= j < m-1` remains valid.

4. **States After Adjusting for the Next Iteration:**
   - `m > 0`: This condition remains unchanged as it is still true.
   - `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`: This remains unchanged.
   - `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`: This remains unchanged.
   - `c` is now `p2[2 * (j + 1)]`: `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `d` is now `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]`: `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`: This remains unchanged.
   - `cand` contains `kandidat`: This remains unchanged.
   - `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`: This remains unchanged.
   - `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`: `j` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:

State: **`m > 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]; `c` is now `p2[2 * (j + 1)]; `d` is now `p2[2 * (j + 1) + 1]; `kandidat` is either `a` or `b`; `cand` contains `kandidat`; `cc[i]` contains `kandidat`; `dd[j + 1]` includes `kandidat`**
