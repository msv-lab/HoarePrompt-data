`kandidat` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is within the range defined by `c` and `d`, meaning `c < a < d`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of `p1[2 * i]`; `b` is the value of `p1[2 * i + 1]`; `c` is the value of `p2[2 * j]`; `d` is the value of `p2[2 * j + 1]`; `kandidat` is equal to `a`; `a` is in `(c, d)`**
