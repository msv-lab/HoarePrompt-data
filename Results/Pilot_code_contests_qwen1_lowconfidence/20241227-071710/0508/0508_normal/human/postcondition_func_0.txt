The function reads two sets of pairs of integers from the standard input. Each set of pairs represents communications between two participants. For each pair from the first participant, it checks if there is a common element with any pair from the second participant. It then collects these common elements into a set called `cand`. After processing all pairs, the function determines whether there is exactly one common element in `cand`. If there is, it prints this element. Otherwise, it checks if any of the participant's sets (`cc` or `dd`) have more than one common element. If all sets have at most one common element, it prints 0. In all other cases, it prints -1. The function does not accept any explicit parameters but relies on the input provided through `raw_input()`.
