You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two participants are each given a pair of distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that there's exactly one number that is present in both pairs. They want to figure out the number that matches by using a communication channel you have access to without revealing it to you.

Both participants communicated to each other a set of pairs of numbers, that includes the pair given to them. Each pair in the communicated sets comprises two different numbers.

Determine if you can with certainty deduce the common number, or if you can determine with certainty that both participants know the number but you do not.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 12) — the number of pairs the first participant communicated to the second and vice versa.

The second line contains n pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from first participant to the second.

The third line contains m pairs of integers, each between 1 and 9, — pairs of numbers communicated from the second participant to the first.

All pairs within each set are distinct (in particular, if there is a pair (1,2), there will be no pair (2,1) within the same set), and no pair contains the same number twice.

It is guaranteed that the two sets do not contradict the statements, in other words, there is pair from the first set and a pair from the second set that share exactly one number.

Output

If you can deduce the shared number with certainty, print that number.

If you can with certainty deduce that both participants know the shared number, but you do not know it, print 0.

Otherwise print -1.

Examples

Input

2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 3 4


Output

1


Input

2 2
1 2 3 4
1 5 6 4


Output

0


Input

2 3
1 2 4 5
1 2 1 3 2 3


Output

-1

Note

In the first example the first participant communicated pairs (1,2) and (3,4), and the second communicated (1,5), (3,4). Since we know that the actual pairs they received share exactly one number, it can't be that they both have (3,4). Thus, the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), and at this point you already know the shared number is 1.

In the second example either the first participant has (1,2) and the second has (1,5), or the first has (3,4) and the second has (6,4). In the first case both of them know the shared number is 1, in the second case both of them know the shared number is 4. You don't have enough information to tell 1 and 4 apart.

In the third case if the first participant was given (1,2), they don't know what the shared number is, since from their perspective the second participant might have been given either (1,3), in which case the shared number is 1, or (2,3), in which case the shared number is 2. While the second participant does know the number with certainty, neither you nor the first participant do, so the output is -1.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    p1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    p2 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    cand = set()
    cc = [set() for i in range(n)]
    dd = [set() for i in range(m)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            (a, b) = (p1[2 * i], p1[2 * i + 1])
            (c, d) = (p2[2 * j], p2[2 * j + 1])
            if a not in (c, d) and b not in (c, d):
                continue
            if a in (c, d) and b in (c, d):
                continue
            if a in (c, d):
                kandidat = a
            else:
                kandidat = b
            cand.add(kandidat)
            cc[i].add(kandidat)
            dd[j].add(kandidat)
    if len(cand) == 1:
        print(cand.pop())
    elif max((len(cc[i]) for i in range(n))) <= 1 and max((len(dd[i]) for i in range(m))) <= 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where the sets of pairs communicated by the participants do not uniquely determine the shared number.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3 2
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 7 3 4 8 9
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

However, the program will output `1` because it does not properly account for the possibility that the shared number could be determined uniquely by one participant but not by the other. In this case, the pairs are:
- First participant: (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)
- Second participant: (1, 7), (3, 4), (8, 9)

The program identifies `1` and `3` as possible candidates but does not correctly handle the situation where the shared number cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the program outputs `1` instead of `-1`.

This failure indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two sets of pairs of integers from the standard input. Each set of pairs represents communications between two participants. For each pair from the first participant, it checks if there is a common element with any pair from the second participant. It then collects these common elements into a set called `cand`. After processing all pairs, the function determines whether there is exactly one common element in `cand`. If there is, it prints this element. Otherwise, it checks if any of the participant's sets (`cc` or `dd`) have more than one common element. If all sets have at most one common element, it prints 0. In all other cases, it prints -1. The function does not accept any explicit parameters but relies on the input provided through `raw_input()`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
