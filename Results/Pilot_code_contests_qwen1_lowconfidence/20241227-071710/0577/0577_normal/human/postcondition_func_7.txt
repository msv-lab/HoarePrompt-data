The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of strings, where each string consists of characters 'A' and 'B' only. It returns a new list of strings from `l`, sorted in descending order based on a custom key 'getKey'. The custom key 'getKey' is not defined in the provided code snippet, which means the sorting behavior is undefined. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that handle special conditions such as empty lists or non-compliant inputs (i.e., strings containing characters other than 'A' and 'B'). Therefore, the final state of the program after executing `func_8` is a list of strings from `l` sorted in descending order according to the undefined 'getKey' function.
