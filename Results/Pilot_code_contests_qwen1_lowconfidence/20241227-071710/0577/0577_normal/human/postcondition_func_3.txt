The function `func_4()` reads a single line of input from the standard input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to a string (though this conversion is unnecessary since the split result is already strings), and returns an iterator over these strings. There are no parameters accepted by the function. Potential edge cases include empty input or input containing only spaces, which would still produce an empty iterator. The function does not handle cases where input might contain tabs or multiple consecutive spaces, though splitting by ' ' should account for these as well.
