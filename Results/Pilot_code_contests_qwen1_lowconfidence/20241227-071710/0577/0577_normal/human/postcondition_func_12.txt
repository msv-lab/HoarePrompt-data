The function `func_13` accepts two parameters: `x` (an integer) and `y` (a positive integer). It returns the integer division of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1. 

This covers all potential cases:
- If `x` is divisible by `y`, the function returns the exact result of the integer division `x // y`.
- If `x` is not divisible by `y`, the function returns `x // y + 1`.

The final state of the program after executing the function is that it has returned either `x // y` or `x // y + 1` based on the divisibility condition. No other variables are modified outside the function scope.
