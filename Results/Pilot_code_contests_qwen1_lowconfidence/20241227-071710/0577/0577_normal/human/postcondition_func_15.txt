The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 3 and even, or if `n` is less than or equal to 3 and divisible by 3, or if `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by any number of the form \(6k \pm 1\) up to \(\sqrt{n}\). It returns `True` if `n` is greater than 3 and not divisible by 2, 3, or any number of the form \(6k \pm 1\) up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
