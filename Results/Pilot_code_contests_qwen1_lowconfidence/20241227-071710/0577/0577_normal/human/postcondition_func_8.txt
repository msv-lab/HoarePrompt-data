The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which represent the dimensions of a 2D list, and `num`, which is an integer value used to initialize all elements in the 2D list. After execution, the function returns a 2D list of size `n x m` where all elements are initialized to the integer value `num`. The function correctly handles the creation of the 2D list and initializes all elements to `num` without any missing functionality. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `m` is zero (in which case the returned list will be empty), or when `num` is any valid integer value (positive, negative, or zero).
