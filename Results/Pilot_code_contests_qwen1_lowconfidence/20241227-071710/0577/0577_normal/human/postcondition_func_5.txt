The function `func_6` sets the recursion limit to 1,000,000 and the stack size to 1,024,000 bytes, then starts a new thread named `thread` which targets the execution of the `main` function. After the thread starts, the function concludes and does not return any value. This means that the `main` function will run in a separate thread with the specified resource limits. There are no parameters accepted by the function, and it does not modify any external state beyond setting these thread properties.
