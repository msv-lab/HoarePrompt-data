The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is a power of 2, otherwise it returns `False`. The function checks this by using the bitwise operation `x and not x & x - 1`. This operation effectively checks if `x` has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation, which is a characteristic of powers of 2. The function correctly handles all edge cases, including `x = 0`, which is not a power of 2, and positive integers that are powers of 2.
