The function `func_3` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each integer from a string to an integer type, and returns a map object containing these integers. There are no parameters passed to the function. The function handles the case where the input is a single line of space-separated strings, which are then converted to integers. However, it does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer inputs or empty input lines. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the behavior is undefined, and the returned map object might raise an error when accessed.
