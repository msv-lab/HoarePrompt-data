The function `solve(s)` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B' only. It first checks if the string contains neither 'AB' nor 'BB'. If both substrings are absent, it returns the length of the string. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of 'AB' and 'BB' from the string and returns the length of the resulting string. The function ensures that the final string does not contain 'AB' or 'BB', and the returned length reflects the size of this modified string.
