The code writes the value of `sep` (which is a space `' '`), to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). After this operation, the value of `file` remains unchanged, but the value of `sep` is no longer relevant as it has been used in the write operation. However, since we cannot see the exact output on `sys.stdout`, we only update the known variables.

Output State: **`file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
