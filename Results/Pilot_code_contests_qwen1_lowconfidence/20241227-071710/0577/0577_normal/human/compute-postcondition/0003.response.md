State before the loop starts: `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, and the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` have been removed from `kwargs` if they existed.

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for x in args:` will execute as long as `args` contains at least one element.
2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `sep`: This variable is a space `' '`.
   - `file`: This variable is set to `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start`: This boolean is `True`.
   - `kwargs`: The keys `'sep'` and `'file'` have been removed from `kwargs` if they existed.

For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element. Since no initial value for `args` is provided, we cannot assume it has any elements or specific values. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `args` is not empty.

State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, `kwargs` does not contain `'sep'` or `'file'`, and `args` must have at least one element**.
