`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file, which in this case is `sys.stdout`. The `at_start` variable does not get affected by this operation, so it remains `False`. The `file` variable also remains `sys.stdout`, and the `sep` variable remains a space `' '`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has had the string representation of `x` written to it.**
