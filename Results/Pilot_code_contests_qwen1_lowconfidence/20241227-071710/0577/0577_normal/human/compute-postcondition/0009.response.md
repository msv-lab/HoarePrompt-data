Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `sep` is a space `' '`
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`
   - `at_start` is `False`
   - A value of `str(x)` has been written to `sys.stdout`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in `args` using the `for` loop:
   ```python
   for x in args:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `args`.
   - In the previous iteration, `at_start` was `False`, meaning that the separator (`sep`) had already been used in the previous iteration. This implies that `sep` is still `' '` and `at_start` is `False` for the current iteration.
   - Since a value of `str(x)` has been written to `sys.stdout` in the previous iteration, the next action should be writing the value of `str(x)` again but with the appropriate separator.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since we are starting a new iteration, `at_start` needs to be set to `True` because this is the beginning of a new segment of output (unless all elements of `args` have been processed).
   - The value of `str(x)` will be written to `sys.stdout` again, so no change is needed for `sep` or `file`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `at_start` is `True`
- The value of `str(x)` will be written to `sys.stdout`

State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
