`at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which was its previous value. The values of the other variables (`sep`, `file`, and `sys.stdout`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `sys.stdout` has had the string representation of `x` written to it.
