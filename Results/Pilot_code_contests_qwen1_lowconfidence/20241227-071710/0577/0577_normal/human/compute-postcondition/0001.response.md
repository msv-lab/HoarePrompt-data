The code snippet assigns default values to `sep` and `file` using the `kwargs.pop` method. The `kwargs` dictionary is expected to contain key-value pairs where keys are used to pop values from `kwargs`. Here, `'sep'` is popped with a default value of a single space `' '`, and `'file'` is popped with a default value of `sys.stdout`.

Since `kwargs` is not defined before this code snippet, we cannot determine its initial contents. However, the code modifies `kwargs` by removing the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` (if they exist) and assigns them default values.

The output state reflects the changes made to `sep` and `file` and the fact that `kwargs` has had the specified keys removed, assuming those keys existed.

Output State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` have been removed from `kwargs` if they existed.**
