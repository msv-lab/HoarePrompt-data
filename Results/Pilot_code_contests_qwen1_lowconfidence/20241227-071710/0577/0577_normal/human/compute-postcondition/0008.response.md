The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables (`sep`, `file`, and the previous output to `sys.stdout`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and a value of `str(x)` has been written to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and a value of `str(x)` has been written to `sys.stdout`.**
