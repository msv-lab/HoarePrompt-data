According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `args`. The loop iterates over each element in `args`. At the end of the last iteration, `sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `args` must contain at least one element that has not been processed yet.
2. `at_start` must be updated to reflect the start of a new argument.

Since the loop is iterating over `args`, if `args` is non-empty, the loop can continue. After processing the current element in `args`, `at_start` will be updated to `True` for the next iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `sep` remains a space `' '`.
- `file` remains `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is updated to `True`.

State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
