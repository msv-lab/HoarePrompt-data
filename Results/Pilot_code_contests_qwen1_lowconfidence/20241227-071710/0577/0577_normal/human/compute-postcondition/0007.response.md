The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which is initially set to `sys.stdout`. Since `sys.stdout` is `stdout`, the string representation of `x` will be printed to the standard output. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, so we cannot determine the exact string that will be written. But we know that `sep` remains a space `' '`, `file` remains `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` remains `False`.

The output state will reflect these unchanged variables along with the fact that a value has been written to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is `False`; a value of `str(x)` has been written to `sys.stdout`.**
