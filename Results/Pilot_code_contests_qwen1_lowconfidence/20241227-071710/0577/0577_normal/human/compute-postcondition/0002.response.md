`at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `sep` and `file` remain unchanged, and the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` have already been removed from `kwargs` in the initial state.

Output State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, and the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` have been removed from `kwargs` if they existed.**
