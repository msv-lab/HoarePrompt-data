The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` impacts the following:

1. It writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`. Here, `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` means it tries to get the value of 'end' from `kwargs` dictionary. If 'end' is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to '\n'.
2. The value of `file` remains `sys.stdout`.
3. The value of `sep` remains `' '`.
4. The value of `at_start` remains `False`.

Since the initial state does not provide any specific value for `kwargs`, we consider the default value for 'end' which is '\n'. Therefore, the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is '\n'.

Output State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the string `\n` has been written to `sys.stdout`.**
