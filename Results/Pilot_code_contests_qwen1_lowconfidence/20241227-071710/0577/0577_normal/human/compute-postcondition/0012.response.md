The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file `file`. However, the value of `file` remains `sys.stdout` and the value of `sep` remains a space `' '`. Since `at_start` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its effect on the values of `sep` and `file`. But the code does not change their values.

Output State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, the string representation of `x` is written to `sys.stdout`.**
