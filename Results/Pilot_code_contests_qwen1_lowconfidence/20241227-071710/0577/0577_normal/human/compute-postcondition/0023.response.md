Postcondition: ***`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, and the string `\n` has been written to `sys.stdout`. If the keyword argument `flush` is `True`, the function flushes the output stream. If `flush` is not provided or is `False`, no additional action is taken.***
