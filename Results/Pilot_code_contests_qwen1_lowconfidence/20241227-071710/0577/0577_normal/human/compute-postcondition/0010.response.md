`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is a space `' '` in this case) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). After executing this line, the value of `sep` remains unchanged, but `sys.stdout` now has a space written to it.

Output State: **`sep` is a space `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`**
