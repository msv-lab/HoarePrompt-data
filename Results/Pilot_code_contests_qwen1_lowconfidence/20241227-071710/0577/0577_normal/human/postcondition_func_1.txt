The function `func_2()` reads a single string `s` from standard input, where `s` consists of 'A' and 'B' characters, and returns this string `s`. It handles multiple test cases, each starting with an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent strings `s` to read. However, the function only processes one string `s` per call and ignores the integer `t`. There is no handling for reading multiple strings or processing more than one test case within a single function call.
