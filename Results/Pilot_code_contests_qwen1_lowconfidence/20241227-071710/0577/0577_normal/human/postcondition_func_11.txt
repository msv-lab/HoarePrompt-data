The function `func_12` takes a non-negative integer `n` represented as a string and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the string representation of `n`. The function splits the string into individual characters, converts each character to an integer, and collects them into a list. This process works for any valid non-negative integer represented as a string, including edge cases like an empty string (which would result in an empty list), and a single-digit number (which would result in a list containing a single integer). There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
