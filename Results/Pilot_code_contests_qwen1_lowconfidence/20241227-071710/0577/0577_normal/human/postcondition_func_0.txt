The function `func_1()` reads an integer input from the user and returns that integer. There are no input parameters defined in the function signature, which means the function does not accept any arguments. The function does not handle any edge cases such as non-integer inputs or errors during input reading. If the user provides a non-integer input, the program will raise a `ValueError` and terminate. After the function concludes, the program will return the integer input provided by the user.
