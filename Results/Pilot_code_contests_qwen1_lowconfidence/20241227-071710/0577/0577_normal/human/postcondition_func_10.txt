The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` (where `n` is greater than or equal to 0) and returns its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly converts the integer to a binary string using the built-in `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix by replacing it with an empty string. This function handles the case where `n` is 0, which would still produce a valid binary representation ('0'). There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code.
