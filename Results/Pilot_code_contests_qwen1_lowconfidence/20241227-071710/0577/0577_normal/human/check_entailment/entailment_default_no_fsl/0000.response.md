Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `solve` function correctly implements the logic required to find the length of the shortest string after performing the specified bombing operations. It checks if the string contains 'AB' or 'BB', and if present, it removes all occurrences of these substrings until none remain. The function then returns the length of the resulting string. Since the problem description and the hints clearly describe the behavior of the `solve` function, and the function handles all cases as described, the code is correct for every potential case.
