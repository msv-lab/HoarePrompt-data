Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the shortest string that can be obtained by removing substrings "AB" or "BB" from the input string. The function `solve(s)` iteratively removes occurrences of "AB" and "BB" until no more can be found, and then returns the length of the remaining string. This approach ensures that the program works for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. Given the examples provided and the general nature of the problem, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly.
