The function does not take any parameters and it is expected to be part of a larger solution where the input is taken from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases, each described by the problem statement. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t strings s, each of which is a non-empty string consisting of 'A' and 'B' characters.
