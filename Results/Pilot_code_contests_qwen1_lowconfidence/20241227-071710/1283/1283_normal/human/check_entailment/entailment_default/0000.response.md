Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of pixels to repaint to achieve a barcode picture. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the conditions for forming valid barcode columns within the specified width constraints (`x` and `y`). Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The function `func_2` does not properly calculate the cost of repainting pixels to form valid barcode columns. For instance, it does not account for the possibility of repainting entire columns to either black or white to ensure the column width is within the specified range.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Edge Cases**: The function `func_2` does not fully handle the scenarios where the initial column width is already within the specified range (`x` to `y`). It should consider the possibility of repainting the entire column if necessary, but the current implementation does not cover this case adequately.

3. **Recursive Cost Calculation**: The recursive calls in `func_2` do not ensure that the column widths are always maintained within the specified range. The function should explicitly handle the cases where the column width needs to be adjusted to fit within `x` to `y`.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee that the minimum number of pixels to repaint will be calculated correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
