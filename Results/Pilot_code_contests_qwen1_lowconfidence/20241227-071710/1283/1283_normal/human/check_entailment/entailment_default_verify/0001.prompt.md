You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists. 

Examples

##.#.
.###.

Input

Output

Note

In the first test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    

In the second test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .#.#.  
    .#.#.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The function `func_2` does not handle the base case correctly. Specifically, it does not check if `w` and `b` are within the allowed range `[x, y]` at the end of the recursion. This can lead to incorrect results if the entire column needs to be changed but the function returns `float('inf')` prematurely.

2. **Recursive Cost Calculation**: The recursive cost calculation in `func_2` does not correctly account for the minimum number of changes needed. For example, if a column needs to be changed entirely from white to black, the function might not consider this as a valid option because it only checks if `w >= x` and `b >= x`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The dynamic programming tables `dp1` and `dp2` are initialized with `-1`, but the function does not handle the base case properly. If the recursion reaches the end without finding a valid solution, it might return incorrect values.

Here is a specific case where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the input:
```
3 3 1 2
###
...
###
```

The expected output should be `2` because we can change the middle column from white to black to meet the requirements.

However, the provided code will likely fail to find this optimal solution due to the issues mentioned above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` computes the minimum cost required to transform a portion of a given image into a monochrome vertical line of black and white pixels. The image is represented by a 2D list `matrix` where '.' denotes a white pixel and '#' denotes a black pixel. The function accepts parameters including dynamic programming tables `dp1` and `dp2`, dimensions `n` and `m`, ranges `x` and `y`, costs for changing colors `black_cost` and `white_cost`, and indices `index`, `w`, and `b`.

- If the current column index `index` is greater than or equal to the total number of columns `m`, and the width of the monochrome vertical line `w` is zero or less than `x`, or the width of the monochrome vertical line `b` is zero or less than `x`, the function returns 0. This handles the case where the desired monochrome line cannot be formed within the specified range.
- If the current column index `index` is still within the image dimensions, the function checks the precomputed values in `dp1` and `dp2`. If available, it returns the minimum of these values. Otherwise, it computes four possible costs:
  - `c1`: The cost of converting white pixels to black from the current position to `x` (if `w < x`).
  - `c2`: The cost of converting black pixels to white from the current position to `x` (if `b < x`).
  - `c3`: The cost of adding a white pixel to the current position.
  - `c4`: The cost of adding a black pixel to the current position.
- The function recursively computes the minimum cost by considering the next column and updating the widths `w` and `b` accordingly. It stores the computed minimum cost in `dp1` and `dp2` and returns the smallest of the four computed costs.
- The function handles all possible edge cases, such as invalid column indices, insufficient pixel widths, and the cost of changing pixel colors.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
