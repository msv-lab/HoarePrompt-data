You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Note

In the first test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    

In the second test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .#.#.  
    .#.#.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list `matrix` representing a pixel picture, where each row is a string of characters '.' and '#', and two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of the matrix. It calculates and returns two lists: `black_cost` and `white_cost`. `black_cost` is a list of length `m`, where each element represents the number of '.' characters in the corresponding column of the matrix. `white_cost` is a list of length `m`, where each element represents the number of '#' characters in the corresponding column of the matrix.

The function iterates over each column of the matrix and counts the number of '.' and '#' characters in each column. It then appends these counts to the respective lists. After processing all columns, the function returns the `black_cost` and `white_cost` lists.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `matrix` is a valid 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns, containing only the characters '.' and '#'. If the input `matrix` is not a valid 2D list or contains invalid characters, the behavior of the function is undefined.
- The function does not validate the values of `n` and `m`. If `n` or `m` are not within the specified bounds (0 < n <= 1000 and 0 < m <= 1000), the function may still execute but the results may be incorrect or unexpected.
- The function does not consider the values of `x` and `y` passed as parameters, as they are not used in the calculation of `black_cost` and `white_cost`.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` computes the minimum cost required to transform a portion of a given image into a monochrome vertical line of black and white pixels. The image is represented by a 2D list `matrix` where '.' denotes a white pixel and '#' denotes a black pixel. The function accepts parameters including dynamic programming tables `dp1` and `dp2`, dimensions `n` and `m`, ranges `x` and `y`, costs for changing colors `black_cost` and `white_cost`, and indices `index`, `w`, and `b`.

- If the current column index `index` is greater than or equal to the total number of columns `m`, and the width of the monochrome vertical line `w` is zero or less than `x`, or the width of the monochrome vertical line `b` is zero or less than `x`, the function returns 0. This handles the case where the desired monochrome line cannot be formed within the specified range.
- If the current column index `index` is still within the image dimensions, the function checks the precomputed values in `dp1` and `dp2`. If available, it returns the minimum of these values. Otherwise, it computes four possible costs:
  - `c1`: The cost of converting white pixels to black from the current position to `x` (if `w < x`).
  - `c2`: The cost of converting black pixels to white from the current position to `x` (if `b < x`).
  - `c3`: The cost of adding a white pixel to the current position.
  - `c4`: The cost of adding a black pixel to the current position.
- The function recursively computes the minimum cost by considering the next column and updating the widths `w` and `b` accordingly. It stores the computed minimum cost in `dp1` and `dp2` and returns the smallest of the four computed costs.
- The function handles all possible edge cases, such as invalid column indices, insufficient pixel widths, and the cost of changing pixel colors.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
