Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where the initial width `w` or `b` is already within the allowed range `[x, y]` for the first column. This means that if the initial width of the monochrome vertical line is already valid, the function should not unnecessarily attempt to change pixels to fit within the range.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

Input:
```
6 5 3 5
.####
###..
##.##
#..#.
.#...
#.##.
.##..
.#.##
#.#..
.#..#
```

In this case, the first column has 2 white pixels and 4 black pixels. The initial width `w` for white pixels is 2, which is within the range [3, 5]. Similarly, the initial width `b` for black pixels is 4, which is also within the range [3, 5]. However, the code does not handle this scenario correctly, as it unnecessarily attempts to change pixels to fit within the range, leading to an incorrect solution.

The code should check if the initial width `w` or `b` is already within the valid range `[x, y]` and directly return the result without further computation. This ensures that the minimum number of changes is accurately calculated even when the initial width is already valid.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
