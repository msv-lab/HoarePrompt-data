Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that each monochrome vertical line's width must be between \(x\) and \(y\) inclusive. The recursive function `func_2` does not properly enforce this constraint for all columns.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 3 1 2
#.#
###
##
```

The program should change the third column from `#.##` to `##`, which requires changing 1 pixel. However, the current implementation might not correctly handle this case due to the way the recursive calls are structured, potentially leading to a suboptimal solution.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for each column, the number of changes made does not violate the constraints \(x \leq \text{group size} \leq y\). The current implementation might not properly update the state to reflect these constraints across all columns.
