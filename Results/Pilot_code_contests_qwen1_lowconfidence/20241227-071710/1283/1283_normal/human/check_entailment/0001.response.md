Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The function `func_2` does not handle the base case correctly. Specifically, it does not check if `w` and `b` are within the allowed range `[x, y]` at the end of the recursion. This can lead to incorrect results if the entire column needs to be changed but the function returns `float('inf')` prematurely.

2. **Recursive Cost Calculation**: The recursive cost calculation in `func_2` does not correctly account for the minimum number of changes needed. For example, if a column needs to be changed entirely from white to black, the function might not consider this as a valid option because it only checks if `w >= x` and `b >= x`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The dynamic programming tables `dp1` and `dp2` are initialized with `-1`, but the function does not handle the base case properly. If the recursion reaches the end without finding a valid solution, it might return incorrect values.

Here is a specific case where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the input:
```
3 3 1 2
###
...
###
```

The expected output should be `2` because we can change the middle column from white to black to meet the requirements.

However, the provided code will likely fail to find this optimal solution due to the issues mentioned above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
