The function `func_2` computes the minimum cost required to transform a portion of a given image into a monochrome vertical line of black and white pixels. The image is represented by a 2D list `matrix` where '.' denotes a white pixel and '#' denotes a black pixel. The function accepts parameters including dynamic programming tables `dp1` and `dp2`, dimensions `n` and `m`, ranges `x` and `y`, costs for changing colors `black_cost` and `white_cost`, and indices `index`, `w`, and `b`.

- If the current column index `index` is greater than or equal to the total number of columns `m`, and the width of the monochrome vertical line `w` is zero or less than `x`, or the width of the monochrome vertical line `b` is zero or less than `x`, the function returns 0. This handles the case where the desired monochrome line cannot be formed within the specified range.
- If the current column index `index` is still within the image dimensions, the function checks the precomputed values in `dp1` and `dp2`. If available, it returns the minimum of these values. Otherwise, it computes four possible costs:
  - `c1`: The cost of converting white pixels to black from the current position to `x` (if `w < x`).
  - `c2`: The cost of converting black pixels to white from the current position to `x` (if `b < x`).
  - `c3`: The cost of adding a white pixel to the current position.
  - `c4`: The cost of adding a black pixel to the current position.
- The function recursively computes the minimum cost by considering the next column and updating the widths `w` and `b` accordingly. It stores the computed minimum cost in `dp1` and `dp2` and returns the smallest of the four computed costs.
- The function handles all possible edge cases, such as invalid column indices, insufficient pixel widths, and the cost of changing pixel colors.
