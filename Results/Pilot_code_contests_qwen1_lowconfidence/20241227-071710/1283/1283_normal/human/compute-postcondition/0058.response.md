The code snippet `c2 += black_cost[i]` increments `c2` by `black_cost[i]`. The previous value of `c2` was `c2` (which is the original value of `c2` plus `black_cost[m]`). Since `i` is updated to `m + 1`, the new value of `c2` is the original value of `c2` plus `black_cost[m]` plus `black_cost[i]`.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, such that `b` must be less than `x - 1`, `cw` equals `w + x`, `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)` or `c1` remains unchanged, `c2` is the original value of `c2` plus `black_cost[m]` plus `black_cost[i]`, `c3` is infinity, `c4` is infinity, `cb` is `b + 1`, `i` is `m + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
