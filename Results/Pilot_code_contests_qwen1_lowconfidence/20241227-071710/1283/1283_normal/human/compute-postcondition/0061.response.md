Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1.
- `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\).
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively.
- `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed.
- `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, such that `b` must be less than `x - 1`.
- `cw` equals `w + x`.
- `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)` or `c1` remains unchanged.
- `c2` is the original value of `c2` plus `black_cost[m]` plus `black_cost[i]`.
- `c3` is infinity.
- `c4` is infinity.
- `cb` is `b + 2`.
- `i` is `m + 2`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while cb < x:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop will continue as long as `cb` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `cb` is `b + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cb` must be less than `x`. 

Given that `cb` is initially `b + 2`, we need to ensure that `b + 2` is less than `x` for the loop to execute again. This means:
\[ b + 2 < x \]
or equivalently,
\[ b < x - 2 \]

### Adjustments Needed:
- We need to ensure that `b` (the number of black pixels in the current vertical line) is less than `x - 2` so that `cb = b + 2` is less than `x`.

### Final State:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `b`, ensuring that `b < x - 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, such that `b < x - 2`, `cw` equals `w + x`, `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)` or `c1` remains unchanged, `c2` is the original value of `c2` plus `black_cost[m]` plus `black_cost[i]`, `c3` is infinity, `c4` is infinity, `cb` is `b + 2`, and `i` is `m + 2`.**
