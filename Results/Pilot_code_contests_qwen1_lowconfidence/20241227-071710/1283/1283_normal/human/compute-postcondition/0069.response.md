The code `c2 += func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)` impacts the following:

- `c2` is incremented by the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)`.
- All other variables remain unaffected.

Given the initial conditions:
- `c2` is the sum of `black_cost` from `index` to `index + k - 1` or infinity (`c2` is infinity).
- `cb` is `b + k`.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `c2` will be updated to `c2 + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)`.
- All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.

Output State: **`c2` is infinity + `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)`, `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)` or `c1` remains unchanged, `c3` is infinity, `c4` is infinity, `cb` is `b + k`, `i` is `index + k`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
