The code `c1 += func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)` updates `c1` by adding the result of `func_2` to its current value. The function `func_2` takes several parameters, but its exact implementation is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value added to `c1`. However, we know the following:

- `c1` is updated by the value returned from `func_2`.
- `i` is set to `index + x`.
- The loop terminates when `i == m` or `cw` reaches `x`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1.
- `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\).
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively.
- `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed.
- `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively.
- `cw` equals `w + x`.
- `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the cumulative cost of changing white pixels to black up to the last row processed.
- `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all set to infinity (`float('inf')`).
- The condition `w < x` was true.
- `i` is `index + x` and the loop terminates when `i == m` or `cw` reaches `x`.

After the execution of the given line of code, the output state is:
- `dp1` is a 2D list initialized with -1.
- `dp2` is a 2D list initialized with -1.
- `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\).
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively.
- `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed.
- `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively.
- `cw` equals `w + x`.
- `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`.
- `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all set to infinity (`float('inf')`).
- The condition `w < x` was true.
- `i` is `index + x` and the loop terminates when `i == m` or `cw` reaches `x`.
