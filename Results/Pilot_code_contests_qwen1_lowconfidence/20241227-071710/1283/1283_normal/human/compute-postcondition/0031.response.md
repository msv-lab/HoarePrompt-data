The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was `index + 1`, so the new value of `i` is `index + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` is a 2D list initialized with -1, `dp2` is a 2D list initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, `cw` is equal to `w + 1`, `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus `white_cost[index]` plus `white_cost[i]`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all set to infinity (`float('inf')`), and the condition `w < x` is true; `i` is now equal to `index + 2` and `cw` must be less than `x`. If `i == m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.**
