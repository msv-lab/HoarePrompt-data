The code assigns `float('inf')` to `c4`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `c4`.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, `c2` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `c3` is `float('inf')`, `c4` is `float('inf')`.**
