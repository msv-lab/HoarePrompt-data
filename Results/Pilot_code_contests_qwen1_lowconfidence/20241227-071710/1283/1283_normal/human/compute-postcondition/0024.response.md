The code snippet increments `c1` by `white_cost[i]`. From the initial state, we know the following:
- `c1` was initially set to a specific value, but its exact initial value is not specified in the problem statement.
- `white_cost` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `i` is equal to `index`.

After executing `c1 += white_cost[i]`, `c1` is updated by adding the value of `white_cost[i]` to its current value.

Output State: **`dp1` is a 2D list initialized with -1, `dp2` is a 2D list initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, `cw` is equal to `w`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all set to infinity (`float('inf')`), and the condition `w < x` is true; `i` is equal to `index`, and `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus `white_cost[i]`.
