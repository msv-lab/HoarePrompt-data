Output State: **`The program returns the minimum value between c1, c2, c3, and c4, where c1 is the original value of c1 plus the value returned from func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0) or remains unchanged, c2 is infinity + the value returned from func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb) if b < x or remains infinity, c3 is white_cost[index] + the value returned from func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0) or remains infinity, and c4 is black_cost[index] + the value returned from func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, 0, b + 1), and cb is b + x if b < x or remains b`**.
