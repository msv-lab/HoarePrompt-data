The `break` statement is executed, which does not modify any variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Based on the initial state and the fact that no variables are updated within the given code snippet, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, such that `b` must be less than `x - 1`, `cw` equals `w + x`, `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is infinity, `c3` is infinity, `c4` is infinity, `cb` is `b + 1`, `i` is `m + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
