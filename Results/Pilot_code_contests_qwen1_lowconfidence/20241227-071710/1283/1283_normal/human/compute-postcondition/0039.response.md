Output State: **`dp1` is a 2D list initialized with -1, `dp2` is a 2D list initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, `cw` equals `w + x`, `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the cumulative cost of changing white pixels to black up to the last row processed, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all set to infinity (`float('inf')`), and the condition `w < x` was true; `i` is `index + x` and the loop terminates when `i == m` or `cw` reaches `x`.**
