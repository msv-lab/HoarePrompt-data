The code sets `c1` to 0. This assignment affects the value of `c1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are all set to infinity (`float('inf')`), and the condition `w < x` is true; `c1` is 0.**
