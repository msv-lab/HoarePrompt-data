Output State: **`dp1[w][index]` is updated to the minimum value between `c1` and `c3`, `dp2` and `matrix` are unchanged, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `x` and `y` are unchanged, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `w` and `b` are unchanged, `cw` is unchanged, `c1` is either the original value of `c1` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)` or remains unchanged, `c2` is either infinity + `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)` if `b < x` or remains infinity, `c3` is either `white_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)` or remains infinity, `c4` is `black_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, 0, b + 1)`, `cb` is either `b + x` if `b < x` or remains `b`, and `i` is either `index + x` if `b < x` or remains `index`. If `b >= x` and `b + 1 <= y`, `c4` is `black_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, 0, b + 1)` and `cb` is either `b + x` if `b < x` or remains `b`.**
