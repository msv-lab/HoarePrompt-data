The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1.
- `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image where '.' is white and '#' is black.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\).
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively.
- `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed.
- `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of black and white pixels respectively.

Based on the given cases, the return values are as follows:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns 0.
- Case_3: The function returns infinity (`float('inf')`).
- Case_4: The function returns the minimum value between `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]`.
- Case_5: The function returns the minimum value between `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`, where:
  - `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)` or remains unchanged,
  - `c2` is infinity plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)` if `b < x` or remains infinity,
  - `c3` is `white_cost[index]` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)` or remains infinity,
  - `c4` is `black_cost[index]` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, 0, b + 1)`, and `cb` is `b + x` if `b < x` or remains `b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept various parameters related to a matrix and costs, and based on specific conditions and recursive calls, return one of the predefined values or compute a new value based on the recursive outcomes.
