The code `break` does not affect any variables' values but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement where the code is placed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, `cw` equals `w + x`, `c1` is the original value of `c1` plus the value returned from `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is infinity, `c3` is infinity, `c4` is infinity, `cb` is equal to `b`, and `i` equals `m`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
