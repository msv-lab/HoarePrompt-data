The code sets `c1` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This initializes `c1` but does not affect the values of other variables. The conditions regarding the states of `dp1`, `dp2`, `matrix`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `black_cost`, `white_cost`, `index`, `w`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image where '.' is white and '#' is black, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, and `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively. The `index` is less than `m`, and either `dp1[w][index]` is -1 or `dp2[b][index]` is -1; `c1` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`).**
