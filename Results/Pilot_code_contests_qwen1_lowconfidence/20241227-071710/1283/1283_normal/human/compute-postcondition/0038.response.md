The code `cw += 1` increments the value of `cw` by 1. Since `cw` was previously defined as `w + 2`, after the increment, `cw` becomes `(w + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `w + 3`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1
- `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image
- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix
- `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\)
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively
- `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed
- `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively
- `cw` is now `w + 3`
- `c1` is `original_value_of_c1 + white_cost[index] + 2 * white_cost[i]`
- `i` is `index + 3`
- `w < x` is true

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, `cw` is `w + 3`, `c1` is `original_value_of_c1 + white_cost[index] + 2 * white_cost[i]`, `i` is `index + 3`, and `w < x` is true.**
