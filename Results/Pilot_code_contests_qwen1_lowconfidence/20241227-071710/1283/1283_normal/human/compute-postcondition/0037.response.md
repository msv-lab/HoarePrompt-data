`i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` was initially set to `index + 2`, so now `i` is `index + 3`. The condition `w < x` remains true, and the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized with -1, `matrix` is a 2D list representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x \leq y\), `black_cost` and `white_cost` are non-negative integers representing the cost of changing a black pixel to white and a white pixel to black respectively, `index` is an integer representing the current column index being processed, `w` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the current width of the monochrome vertical line of white and black pixels respectively, `cw` is `w + 2`, `c1` is `original_value_of_c1 + white_cost[index] + 2 * white_cost[i]`, `i` is `index + 3`, and `w < x` is true.**
