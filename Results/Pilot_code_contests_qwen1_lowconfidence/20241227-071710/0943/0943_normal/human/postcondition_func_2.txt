The function `func_3` accepts a non-negative integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < H\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap. It returns the integer value of \((i - 1) / 2\). This calculation is performed using integer division, ensuring that the result is always an integer. The function handles the case when \(i = 0\) by returning 0, since \((-1) / 2\) would otherwise result in 0 due to integer division rules. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
