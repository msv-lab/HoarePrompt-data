The function `func_1` accepts an integer `i` as a parameter, which must satisfy the condition 0 â‰¤ i < H (where H is the number of elements in the binary heap). The function returns an integer that is calculated as 2 times `i` plus 1. This operation is performed without any edge case handling or additional logic beyond the simple mathematical computation specified in the annotations. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; the code directly computes and returns the value 2 * i + 1 based on the input `i`.
