Final: **True**

Reasoning:
Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the state of the program at various points, and it aligns with the expected behavior of the max-heap construction algorithm.

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Calculates the left child index of a node. The annotation correctly describes the range of `i` as \(0 \leq i < H\).
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Calculates the right child index of a node. The annotation correctly describes the range of `i` as \(0 \leq i < \frac{H}{2}\).
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Calculates the parent index of a node. The annotation correctly describes the range of `i` as \(0 \leq i < H\).
- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: Ensures the max-heap property is maintained by recursively swapping elements if necessary. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program after each step.
- **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: Reads input and builds a max-heap using `func_4` in a bottom-up manner. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program after reading input and before and after the for loop.

Given that the annotated code accurately reflects the expected behavior and the original assessment correctly identifies the program's adherence to the max-heap construction algorithm, the original assessment remains accurate. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the final assessment is **True**.
