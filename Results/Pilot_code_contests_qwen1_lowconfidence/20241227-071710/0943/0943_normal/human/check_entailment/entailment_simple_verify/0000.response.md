Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The annotated version confirms that there is a critical issue in the `func_4` function, specifically in the recursive call. According to the pseudo-code, after determining the largest element among the node and its children, the function should recursively call `maxHeapify` on the largest child. However, in the given implementation, the recursive call is made with the original index `i` instead of the largest child's index. This means the function does not properly adjust the subtree rooted at the node, leading to a failure in constructing a valid max-heap.

The annotated version supports this by showing that the state transitions and conditions in `func_4` do not reflect the correct behavior described in the pseudo-code. For example, the condition `if (largest != i)` only ensures that a swap is made if the largest element is not the current node, but it does not guarantee that the subtree is properly adjusted through recursion.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, the program does not correctly implement the `maxHeapify` function and fails to construct a valid max-heap. Hence, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is maintained.
