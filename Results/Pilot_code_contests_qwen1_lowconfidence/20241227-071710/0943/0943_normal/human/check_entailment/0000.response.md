Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the `maxHeapify` function as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in the recursive call to `func_4`. According to the pseudo-code, after swapping the parent node with the largest child, the function should be called recursively on the largest child node. However, in the given implementation, the recursive call is made with the original index `i`, which is incorrect. This will lead to the function not properly adjusting the subtree rooted at the node.

For example, consider the input:

```
10
4 1 3 2 16 9 10 14 8 7
```

The output produced by the program is:

```
16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1
```

However, this is not a valid max-heap because the subtree rooted at node 1 (value 16) does not satisfy the max-heap property. Node 1 should have a value greater than or equal to both its children, but in the output, node 2 (value 14) is smaller than node 1. Therefore, the program does not correctly construct a max-heap according to the given pseudo-code.
