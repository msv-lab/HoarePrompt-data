Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided annotated program does not fully implement the `buildMaxHeap` algorithm as described in the problem description. Specifically, the following issues exist:

1. **Function Definitions and Usage**:
   - Functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined to compute the indices of the left and right children of a node, respectively. These functions are used correctly within the `func_4` function.
   - Function `func_3` is defined to compute the parent index of a node. This function is also used correctly within the `func_4` function.
   - Function `func_4` implements the `maxHeapify` operation, which ensures that the subtree rooted at a given node satisfies the max-heap property.
   - However, there is no direct implementation of the `buildMaxHeap` function as described in the problem description.

2. **Missing `buildMaxHeap` Function**:
   - The `buildMaxHeap` function should iterate over the nodes from `H/2` down to `1` and call `maxHeapify` on each node. This step is crucial for ensuring that the entire heap satisfies the max-heap property.
   - The provided program does not include this part of the algorithm. Instead, it only calls `maxHeapify` directly without ensuring that all necessary nodes are processed in a bottom-up manner.

To correct the program, the missing `buildMaxHeap` function needs to be implemented as follows:

```python
def buildMaxHeap(array, size):
    for i in range(func_3(size), 0, -1):
        func_4(array, i, size)

# Call the buildMaxHeap function after reading the input
buildMaxHeap(array, size)
```

By adding this `buildMaxHeap` function and calling it after reading the input, the program will correctly construct a max-heap according to the problem description.
