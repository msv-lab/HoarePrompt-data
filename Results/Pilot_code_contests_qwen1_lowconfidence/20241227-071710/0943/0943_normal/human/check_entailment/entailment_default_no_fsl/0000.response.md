Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully implement the `maxHeapify` algorithm as described in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_4` (which is meant to mimic the `maxHeapify` behavior) does not handle the case where the node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children). According to the problem description, if the node has no children, the `maxHeapify` function should not perform any swaps and should simply return. However, the current implementation in `func_4` always tries to compare the node with its left and right children, even if they do not exist. This could lead to incorrect behavior when dealing with leaf nodes.

To fix this, the implementation should include checks to see if the left and right indices are within bounds before performing the comparison and swap operations. For example:

```python
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]:
        largest = left
    if right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]:
        largest = right
    if largest != i:
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)
```

This corrected version ensures that only existing children are compared and swapped, maintaining the max-heap property correctly.
