Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code functionality. The program correctly implements the max-heap construction algorithm. Specifically, the `func_4` function ensures that the max-heap property is maintained by recursively comparing and swapping elements as necessary. The `func_5` function reads the heap size and elements from standard input, calls `func_4` in a bottom-up manner, and modifies the array in place to form a valid max-heap. The output hints confirm that the program constructs a max-heap correctly, aligning with the problem description and the original assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment as **True** is justified.
