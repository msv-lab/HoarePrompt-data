Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The `func_4` function, which is intended to implement the `maxHeapify` algorithm, incorrectly makes a recursive call with the original index `i` instead of the index of the largest child node. This means that after swapping the parent node with the largest child, the function does not recursively call itself on the largest child node to ensure the max-heap property is maintained for the entire subtree. As a result, the program does not correctly construct a max-heap from the given input array. 

The output hints suggest that the function should modify the array in place to maintain the heap property, and that the final state of the program should represent a valid binary max-heap. However, due to the incorrect implementation of the recursive call in `func_4`, the program fails to achieve this, as demonstrated by the example input and output provided. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
