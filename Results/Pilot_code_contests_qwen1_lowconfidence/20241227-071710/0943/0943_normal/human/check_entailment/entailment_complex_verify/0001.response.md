Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program correctly implements the max-heap construction algorithm. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly compute the indices for the left child, right child, and parent of a node, respectively. The function `func_4` ensures that the max-heap property is maintained by recursively calling itself to fix the heap structure if necessary. Finally, `func_5` reads the input, initializes the array, and constructs the max-heap by calling `func_4` in a bottom-up manner. The annotations support the correctness of the implementation, and there are no contradictions or issues identified that would indicate the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is justified.
