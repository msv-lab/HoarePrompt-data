Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Although the annotated version of the code provides detailed explanations of each function, it confirms that the issue identified in the original assessment still exists. Specifically, the recursive call to `func_4` in `func_4` should be made with the `largest` index rather than the original `i`. The annotated version shows that after swapping the parent node with the largest child, the function should be called recursively on the largest child node to ensure the heap property is maintained throughout the subtree. 

The provided example input and expected output demonstrate that the current implementation does not correctly construct a max-heap. The output fails to maintain the max-heap property, as evidenced by the value at node 1 (16) being smaller than one of its children (14). Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
