Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program follows the given max-heap construction algorithm accurately. It correctly implements the `maxHeapify` function and uses it in a bottom-up manner to construct a max-heap from the given array. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to calculate the left child, right child, and parent indices, respectively. The `func_4` function recursively ensures that the max-heap property is maintained by swapping elements as necessary. The `func_5` function reads the input and applies the `maxHeapify` process to build the max-heap. Given the example input and output, the program handles the heap construction as described in the problem statement without any issues.
