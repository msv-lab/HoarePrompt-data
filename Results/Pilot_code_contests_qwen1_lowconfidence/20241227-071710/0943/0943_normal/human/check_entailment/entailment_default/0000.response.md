Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the construction of a max-heap from a given array of integers. Let's break down the code and verify its correctness:

1. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1(i)` calculates the left child index of a node with index `i` and returns `2 * i + 1`.
   - `func_2(i)` calculates the right child index of a node with index `i` and returns `2 * i + 2`.
   - `func_3(i)` calculates the parent index of a node with index `i` and returns `int((i - 1) / 2)`.
   These functions are used to determine the indices of child and parent nodes, which are essential for the `maxHeapify` function.

2. **maxHeapify Function**:
   - The `func_4` function correctly implements the `maxHeapify` algorithm described in the problem statement. It checks if the current node needs to be swapped with its larger child and recursively calls itself to ensure the heap property is maintained.

3. **buildMaxHeap Function**:
   - The `func_5` function correctly implements the `buildMaxHeap` algorithm. It iterates from the last parent node to the root node and calls `func_4` to ensure the max-heap property is maintained for each node.

Given these points, the code follows the problem description accurately. It handles the construction of a max-heap for any valid input array of integers, ensuring that the heap property is maintained throughout the process. The provided output hints and code implementation align with the problem requirements, making the code correct for every potential case.
