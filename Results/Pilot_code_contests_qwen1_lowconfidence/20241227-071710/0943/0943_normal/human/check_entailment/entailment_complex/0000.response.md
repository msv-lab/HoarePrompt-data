Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python code, including all the functions, follows the problem description for every potential case:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the left child index of a node, which is correct according to the binary heap properties.
   - The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior and there are no edge cases missing.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function calculates the right child index of a node, which is correct.
   - The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior and there are no edge cases missing.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function calculates the parent index of a node, which is correct.
   - The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior and there are no edge cases missing.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - The function maintains the max-heap property by ensuring the parent node is greater than or equal to its children.
   - The function recursively calls itself to ensure the heap property is maintained for the entire subtree.
   - The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior and there are no edge cases missing. The function handles the case when the largest child index is out of bounds, which is correctly managed.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - The function reads the size of the heap and its elements from standard input, then calls `func_4` for each parent node in reverse order.
   - The function ensures the heap property is maintained by calling `func_4` for each node.
   - The annotation correctly describes the function's behavior and there are no edge cases missing. The function handles the case when the input is valid, which is assumed.

The code correctly implements the max-heap construction algorithm and handles all potential cases described in the problem statement and annotations. Therefore, the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
