Postcondition: ***`largest` is an integer such that if `largest` is not equal to `i`, then either `array[i]` is equal to `array[largest]` and `largest` remains unchanged, or `array[largest]` is updated to `array[i]` and the function `func_4(array, largest, item_num)` has been called. Otherwise, `largest` remains unchanged.***
