Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `func_4(array, i_end - 1, size)` was previously called.
   - This means `i` was `i_end - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Current Call:**
   - Now, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called, where `i` is `i_end - 1`.

3. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over `range(0, func_3(size))` in reverse order.
   - Therefore, the loop starts from `func_3(size) - 1` and goes down to 0.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was `i_end - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop iterates in reverse).
   - Hence, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end - 2`.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the bounds defined by `func_3(size)`.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be updated as follows:

- `i` will be `i_end - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should still be within the range defined by `func_3(size)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i_end - 2` and must be within the range defined by `func_3(size)`**
