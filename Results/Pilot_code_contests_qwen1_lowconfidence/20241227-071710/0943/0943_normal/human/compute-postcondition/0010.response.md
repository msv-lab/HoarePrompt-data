Functionality: **The function reads the size of a binary heap and its elements from standard input, then calls `func_4` for each element in the heap, starting from the last parent node and moving upwards. The function modifies the array in place to maintain the heap property. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the array represents a valid binary heap where each parent node is greater than or equal to its children (for a max heap). Potential edge cases include empty input or non-integer inputs, which are not handled within this function and would need to be managed externally.**
