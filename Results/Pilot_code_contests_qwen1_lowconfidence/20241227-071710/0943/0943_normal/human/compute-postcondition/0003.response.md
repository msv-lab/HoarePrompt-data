The function `func_4(array, i, size)` is called with three parameters: `array`, `i`, and `size`. However, the function definition or its implementation is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. Given this lack of information, the only thing we can conclude is that the function call itself does not directly modify the stated variables without knowing the function's behavior.

Output State: **`func_4(array, i, size)` has been called**
