The function `func_4(array, largest, item_num)` is called with the current state of the variables `array[i]`, `array[largest]`, `tmp`, and `largest`. However, the code snippet does not show what happens inside the function, only that the function call is made. Without additional information about the function's implementation, we cannot determine how the variables will be modified or if any new variables will be created.

Given the initial state and the function call, the only information we can definitively say is that the function `func_4` is being executed. The specific values of the variables `array[i]`, `array[largest]`, `tmp`, and `largest` remain unchanged until the function returns. Since no assignment or modification of these variables is shown in the code snippet, we assume they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`array[i]' is equal to `array[largest]', `tmp' is equal to `array[i]', and `largest' remains unchanged; `array[largest]' is now equal to `array[i]', and the function `func_4(array, largest, item_num)` has been called.**
