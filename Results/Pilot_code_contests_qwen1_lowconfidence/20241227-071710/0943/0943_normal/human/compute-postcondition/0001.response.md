The code reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map`, and assigns the resulting iterator to `array`. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values in `array`, but we know that `array` now contains the integers read from standard input.

Output State: **`size` is an integer input from standard input; `array` is an iterator of integers representing the converted input values**
