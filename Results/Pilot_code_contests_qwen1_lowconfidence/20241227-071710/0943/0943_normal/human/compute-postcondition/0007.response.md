Output State: **`i` is `i_end - 2`, `array`, `i`, and `size` are passed to `func_4`, but the values of `array`, `i`, and `size` inside `func_4` are not specified.**

In this case, the function `func_4` is called with the arguments `array`, `i`, and `size`. However, since the exact behavior of `func_4` is not specified, no changes to the variables are indicated. The initial values of `i` and the fact that `i` must be within the range defined by `func_3(size)` are preserved. The values of `array` and `size` are passed to `func_4`, but their specific values are not known.
