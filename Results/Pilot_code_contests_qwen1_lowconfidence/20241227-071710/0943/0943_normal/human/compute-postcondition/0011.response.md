`array[i]` is assigned the value of `array[largest]`. Given the precondition, `largest` is an integer such that if the right child index (`right`) is less than `item_num` and the value of the right child (`array[right]`) is greater than the value of the current largest (`array[largest]`), then `largest` is set to `right`. Otherwise, `largest` remains unchanged. 

- `array[i]` gets updated to the value of `array[largest]`.
- `tmp` is still equal to `array[i]` (which was assigned in the previous step).
- `largest` remains unchanged because the code does not modify its value.

Output State: **`array[i]` is equal to `array[largest]`, `tmp` is equal to `array[i]`, and `largest` remains unchanged.**
