To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `size` is an integer input from standard input.
- `array` is an iterator of integers representing the converted input values.
- The loop iterates over the range `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Range:**
   - The loop uses `range(0, func_3(size))`, but it is being iterated in reverse order using `reversed()`.
   - For the loop to execute, `func_3(size)` must return a non-negative integer because `range()` requires its first argument (start) to be less than or equal to the second argument (stop).
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse, the range will include all integers from `func_3(size) - 1` down to `0`.

2. **Conditions for Execution:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `func_3(size)` must return a value greater than 0. If `func_3(size)` returns 0 or a negative number, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- We need to ensure that `func_3(size)` returns a positive integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

### Final State:
- The state should be modified to ensure that the loop can execute, meaning `func_3(size)` must return a positive integer.

**State:**
**`size` is an integer input from standard input, `array` is an iterator of integers representing the converted input values, `func_3(size)` must return a positive integer.**
