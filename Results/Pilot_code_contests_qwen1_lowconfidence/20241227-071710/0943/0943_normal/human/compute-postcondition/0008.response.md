Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided information and the structure of the loop itself.

### Initial State Recap
- `size` is an integer input from standard input.
- `array` is an iterator of integers representing the converted input values.
- The loop iterates over a range generated by `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`.

### Loop Analysis

1. **First Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with the largest index generated by `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`.
   - `func_4(array, i, size)` is called for the largest valid index `i`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - The next iteration decrements `i` by 1 (since the range is reversed).
   - `func_4(array, i, size)` is called for the next valid index `i`.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - The process continues until the loop reaches the smallest valid index.
   - For the third iteration, `i` would be `i_end - 2` (where `i_end` is the largest index).

4. **General Iteration:**
   - After `n` iterations, `i` will be `i_end - (n - 1)`.
   - The loop will call `func_4(array, i, size)` for each valid index, decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

5. **Final Iteration:**
   - When the loop finishes, `i` will be 0 (if `func_3(size)` returns a positive integer).
   - Therefore, `func_4(array, 0, size)` will be called.

### Conclusion
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are valid indices in the range `range(0, func_3(size))`.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be 0, and `func_4(array, 0, size)` will have been called.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `func_3(size)` returns 0), `i` remains undefined (not applicable in this context since we're focusing on the loop's behavior when it does execute).

### Final Output State
- `i` will be 0 after all iterations.
- `func_4(array, 0, size)` will have been called.
- The values of `array` and `size` will remain unchanged.

**Output State:**
**i is 0, `func_4(array, 0, size)` has been called, array and size remain unchanged.**
