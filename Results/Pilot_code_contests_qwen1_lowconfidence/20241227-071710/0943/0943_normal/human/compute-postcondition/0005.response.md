The function `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called, replacing the previous call to `func_4(array, i_end - 1, size)`. This means `i` has been updated to `i_end - 1` in the previous call. However, since the exact values of the variables are not provided, we can only state that `i` is now one less than `i_end`.

Output State: **`func_4(array, i_end - 1, size)` was previously called, now `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called where `i` is `i_end - 1`.**
