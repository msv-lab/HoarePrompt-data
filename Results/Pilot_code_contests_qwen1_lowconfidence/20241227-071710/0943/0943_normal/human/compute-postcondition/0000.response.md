The code reads an integer from standard input, which represents the size of the array, and assigns this value to the variable `size`. The input is converted to an integer using `int()`. The initial state of the array and its binary heap properties remain unchanged.

Output State: **size is an integer input from standard input, array is an iterable of integers representing the initial state of the binary heap**
