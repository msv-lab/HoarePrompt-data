Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range generated by `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`. This means it starts from `func_3(size) - 1` and decrements `i` until `i` is no longer in the range.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called. This implies that `i` was within the valid range of the loop for that iteration.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the valid range of the loop. Since the loop decrements `i`, we need to find the value of `i` at the end of the current iteration and ensure that `i` can still decrement to a valid value.

Given the information that `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that `i` was within the valid range. Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented from `i_end` to a value that is still within the valid range. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `i_end - 1`.

5. **Ensure Valid Range**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `func_3(size)`. Therefore, `i_end - 1` must be less than `func_3(size)`.

6. **Update the State**: The state needs to be updated such that `i` is set to `i_end - 1`, and the condition for the next iteration is checked.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_end` from the previous iteration, we can represent it symbolically. However, we know that `i_end` was valid for the previous iteration, and we need to decrement it by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`func_4(array, i, size)` has been called, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Hence, the new value of `i` should be `i_end - 1`, where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

State: **`func_4(array, i_end - 1, size)` has been called, where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**
