`array[largest]` is assigned the value of `tmp`. According to the initial state, `tmp` is equal to `array[i]`, and `array[i]` is equal to `array[largest]`. Therefore, `array[largest]` will now be equal to `array[i]`, which is also equal to `array[largest]`. The value of `largest` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`array[i]` is equal to `array[largest]`, `tmp` is equal to `array[i]`, and `largest` remains unchanged; `array[largest]` is now equal to `array[i]`.**
