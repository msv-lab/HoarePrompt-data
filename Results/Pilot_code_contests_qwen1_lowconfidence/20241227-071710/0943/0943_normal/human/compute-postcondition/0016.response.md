Functionality: **The function `func_4` maintains the max-heap property for a binary heap represented by the list `array`. It takes a list of integers `array`, an integer index `i` (where `0 < i < len(array)`), and an integer `item_num` representing the heap size. The function checks if the element at index `i` is smaller than its left and right children and swaps it with the largest child if necessary. This process is recursively applied until the heap property is satisfied at index `i`. Potential edge cases include when `i` is at the leaf nodes where no children exist (`left >= item_num` or `right >= item_num`). If `largest` is not equal to `i`, the function calls itself recursively to ensure the heap property is maintained for the new largest node. If `largest` remains unchanged, no further recursive calls are made.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the function, including the recursive nature of the heap adjustment and the handling of potential edge cases where the node might already satisfy the max-heap property.
