The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `array`, `i`, and `item_num`. 

- `array` is a list of integers representing the elements of the binary heap.
- `i` is an integer such that \(0 < i < \text{len(array)}\).
- `item_num` is an integer representing the size of the heap (i.e., the number of elements in the heap).

Based on the provided output cases, the function does not explicitly return a value but seems to be involved in operations related to maintaining the properties of a binary heap. However, since the specific return value was not detailed in the problem statement, we will assume the function does not return anything and instead focuses on heap operations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a list of integers `array`, an integer index `i`, and an integer `item_num` representing the heap size, and perform operations related to maintaining the properties of a binary heap.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array`, an integer index `i`, and an integer `item_num` representing the heap size, and performs operations to maintain the properties of a binary heap.**
