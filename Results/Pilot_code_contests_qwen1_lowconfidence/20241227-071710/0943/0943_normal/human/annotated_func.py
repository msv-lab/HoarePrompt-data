#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < H, where H is the number of elements in the binary heap represented as an array.
def func_1(i):
    return 2 * i + 1
    #The program returns an integer that is 2 times i plus 1, where 0 <= i < H
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `i` as a parameter, which must satisfy the condition 0 â‰¤ i < H (where H is the number of elements in the binary heap). The function returns an integer that is calculated as 2 times `i` plus 1. This operation is performed without any edge case handling or additional logic beyond the simple mathematical computation specified in the annotations. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; the code directly computes and returns the value 2 * i + 1 based on the input `i`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < H // 2, where H is the number of elements in the binary heap represented as an array.
def func_2(i):
    return 2 * i + 2
    #The program returns an integer which is 2 times the value of i plus 2, given that 0 <= i < H // 2, where H is the number of elements in the binary heap represented as an array
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `i` as a parameter, where `0 <= i < H // 2`, and returns an integer which is 2 times the value of `i` plus 2. Given the constraints on `i`, the function always returns a valid integer. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code snippet. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the calculated integer value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < H, where H is the number of elements in the binary heap.
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)
    #The program returns the integer value of (i - 1) / 2, where i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < H
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a non-negative integer `i` such that \(0 \leq i < H\), where \(H\) is the number of elements in the binary heap. It returns the integer value of \((i - 1) / 2\). This calculation is performed using integer division, ensuring that the result is always an integer. The function handles the case when \(i = 0\) by returning 0, since \((-1) / 2\) would otherwise result in 0 due to integer division rules. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing the elements of the binary heap, i is an integer such that 0 < i < len(array), and item_num is an integer representing the size of the heap (i.e., the number of elements in the heap).
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if (left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]) :
        largest = left
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`largest` is an integer such that 0 < `i` < `len(array)` and `item_num` is an integer representing the size of the heap. If the left child of `i` (array[func_1(i)]) is greater than the current largest (array[largest]) and the left child index is less than `item_num`, then `largest` is set to `func_1(i)`. Otherwise, `largest` remains unchanged.
    if (right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]) :
        largest = right
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`largest` is an integer such that if the right child index (right) is less than `item_num` and the value of the right child (array[right]) is greater than the value of the current largest (array[largest]), then `largest` is set to `right`. Otherwise, `largest` remains unchanged.
    if (largest != i) :
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`largest` is an integer such that if `largest` is not equal to `i`, then either `array[i]` is equal to `array[largest]` and `largest` remains unchanged, or `array[largest]` is updated to `array[i]` and the function `func_4(array, largest, item_num)` has been called. Otherwise, `largest` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` maintains the max-heap property for a binary heap represented by the list `array`. It takes a list of integers `array`, an integer index `i` (where `0 < i < len(array)`), and an integer `item_num` representing the heap size. The function checks if the element at index `i` is smaller than its left and right children and swaps it with the largest child if necessary. This process is recursively applied until the heap property is satisfied at index `i`. Potential edge cases include when `i` is at the leaf nodes where no children exist (`left >= item_num` or `right >= item_num`). If `largest` is not equal to `i`, the function calls itself recursively to ensure the heap property is maintained for the new largest node. If `largest` remains unchanged, no further recursive calls are made.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: size is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, and array is an iterable of integers representing the initial state of the binary heap.
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the size of a binary heap and its elements from standard input, then calls `func_4` for each element in the heap, starting from the last parent node and moving upwards. The function modifies the array in place to maintain the heap property. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the array represents a valid binary heap where each parent node is greater than or equal to its children (for a max heap). Potential edge cases include empty input or non-integer inputs, which are not handled within this function and would need to be managed externally.
