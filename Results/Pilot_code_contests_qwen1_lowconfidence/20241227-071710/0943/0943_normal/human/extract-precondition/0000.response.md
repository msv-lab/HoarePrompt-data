Precondition: **size is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the array, and array is an iterable of integers representing the initial state of the binary heap.** 

Note: `func_3` and `func_4` are assumed to be helper functions that are part of the overall solution but not provided in the snippet. The provided code snippet calls these functions to build the max-heap.
