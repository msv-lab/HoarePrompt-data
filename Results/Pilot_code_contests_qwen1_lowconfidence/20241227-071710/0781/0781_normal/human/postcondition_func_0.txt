The function reads an integer input from the user, which represents the number of bags, and returns this integer. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond reading this single integer input. The function guarantees that the input is an integer and that the number of bags is correctly represented by this integer. Potential edge cases include non-integer inputs, although the problem statement implies that only integer inputs will be given. The final state of the program is that it has received and returned the number of bags as specified by the user.
