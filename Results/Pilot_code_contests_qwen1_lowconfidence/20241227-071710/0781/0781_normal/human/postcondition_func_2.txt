The function `func_3()` accepts no explicit parameters and returns the input provided by the user. The function reads a single line of input from the user, which can be any string, and returns it unchanged. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond reading the input and returning it. This means that the function simply acts as a passthrough for user input, without modifying or validating the input in any way.
