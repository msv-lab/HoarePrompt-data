T is an integer representing the number of bags, and the subsequent lines contain descriptions of each bag, where the first line of each bag description contains an integer n representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, followed by a line containing n integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. Each integer a_i represents the filling type, and the same fillings are defined as same integers, different fillings as different integers. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.
