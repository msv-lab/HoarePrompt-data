The function reads input from 'input.txt' and writes output to 'output.txt'. It processes a positive integer T, which represents the number of bags. For each bag, it reads a positive integer n, which represents the number of patty-cakes, and then reads n positive integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. The function guarantees that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. After processing all the bags, the function writes the results to 'output.txt'. The function does not return any value but modifies the contents of 'output.txt' based on the input data.
