T is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100. For each bag, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the bag description consists of a line with n integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5, and each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling.
