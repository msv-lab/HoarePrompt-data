The function processes a list of patty-cakes distributed across multiple bags. For each bag, it counts the number of patty-cakes with the same filling and determines the minimum number of additional bags needed such that no bag contains more than one patty-cake with the same filling. The function iterates through each bag, sorts the list of patty-cakes, and computes the required number of additional bags using specific conditions. If a bag already satisfies the condition where no patty-cakes have the same filling, it skips further processing. The function ultimately returns the total number of additional bags needed across all bags, or 0 if no additional bags are needed.
