The function `func_10` accepts two parameters, `b` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the condition that `m > b`. The function first calls another function `func_8(b, m)` to get a value `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, the function immediately returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the result of `pow(b, m - 2, m)`, which is `b` raised to the power of `(m-2)` modulo `m`. The function can return either -1 or the specified modular exponentiation result based on the value of `g`. There are no additional actions or edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need to be considered beyond these two main outcomes.
