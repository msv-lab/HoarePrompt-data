T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 100, representing the number of bags. Each bag is described with two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag; the second line contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the fillings of the patty-cakes, where the same fillings are represented by the same integers and different fillings by different integers. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. The sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.
