#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer representing the number of bags, and the subsequent lines contain descriptions of each bag, where the first line of each bag description contains an integer n representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, followed by a line containing n integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. Each integer a_i represents the filling type, and the same fillings are defined as same integers, different fillings as different integers. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer representing the number of bags, which is the value input by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input from the user, which represents the number of bags, and returns this integer. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond reading this single integer input. The function guarantees that the input is an integer and that the number of bags is correctly represented by this integer. Potential edge cases include non-integer inputs, although the problem statement implies that only integer inputs will be given. The final state of the program is that it has received and returned the number of bags as specified by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
def func_2():
    return float(input())
    #The program returns a float input from the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input a float value. The function then reads and returns this float value. There are no edge cases to consider since the function simply reads a single float input from the user without any additional checks or transformations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, and for each bag described by the subsequent inputs: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and there exists at least two indices i and j such that i ≠ j and a_i = a_j.
def func_3():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3()` accepts no explicit parameters and returns the input provided by the user. The function reads a single line of input from the user, which can be any string, and returns it unchanged. There are no additional actions performed by the function beyond reading the input and returning it. This means that the function simply acts as a passthrough for user input, without modifying or validating the input in any way.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, and for each bag, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and there exists at least two indices i and j such that a_i = a_j.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing strings of the input split by spaces, where the input consists of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and there exists at least two indices i and j such that a_i = a_j
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, which consists of multiple lines. Each line starts with an integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 100) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ \( 10^5 \), 1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( n \), and there exist at least two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( a_i = a_j \)). The function then processes this input by splitting the second part of each line into individual space-separated strings and returns a map object containing these strings. However, the function only processes the first line of the input, ignoring any subsequent lines. There is no missing functionality in terms of the described behavior; the edge case where multiple lines of input are provided is handled by processing only the first line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer representing the number of bags, and for each bag: n is an integer representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag, followed by a line of n space-separated integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. Each bag description is separated by a newline.
def func_5():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from user input split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5()` reads a single line of user input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element into an integer. It then returns a map object containing these integers. This function does not accept any parameters and relies on standard input. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or non-integer values in the input. If the input is empty, the map object will be empty. If non-integer values are entered, they will raise a `ValueError` which is not caught within this function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no information about the variables used in this function, and the function does not take any arguments or return any values related to the problem description. Therefore, we cannot provide a meaningful precondition based on the given function signature alone.
def func_6():
    return list(func_5())
    #The program returns a list generated by the function `func_5()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_5()`. After the function concludes, the program state will be such that it returns a list of elements produced by `func_5()`. No additional actions are performed within `func_6` itself. If `func_5` returns an empty list or encounters any errors, `func_6` will simply return an empty list without further processing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 100, representing the number of bags. Each bag is described with two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the number of patty-cakes in the bag; the second line contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the fillings of the patty-cakes, where the same fillings are represented by the same integers and different fillings by different integers. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. The sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.
def func_7():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from 'input.txt' and writes output to 'output.txt'. It processes a positive integer T, which represents the number of bags. For each bag, it reads a positive integer n, which represents the number of patty-cakes, and then reads n positive integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. The function guarantees that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. After processing all the bags, the function writes the results to 'output.txt'. The function does not return any value but modifies the contents of 'output.txt' based on the input data.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers where y is not zero.
def func_8(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0
    return x
    #The program returns x which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of x and y, and y is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where both are non-negative integers and `y` is not zero. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. If either `x` or `y` is 0 initially, the function still performs the necessary operations to ensure the correct GCD is returned. If `x` is 0 and `y` is not, the GCD will be `y`. If `y` is 0 and `x` is not, the GCD will be `x`. If both are 0, the function will handle this case appropriately by ensuring `x` (the GCD) is 0 after the loop.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_9(x, y):
    return x * y // func_8(x, y)
    #The program returns the integer division of x * y by func_8(x, y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts two positive integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes the integer division of the product of `x` and `y` by the result of calling another function `func_8(x, y)`. The function returns the resulting integer value. Potential edge cases include when `func_8(x, y)` returns zero, in which case the function would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. The function assumes that both `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `func_8(x, y)` returns a non-negative integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive integer, and m is a positive integer such that m > b.
def func_10(b, m):
    g = func_8(b, m)
    if (g != 1) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    else :
        return pow(b, m - 2, m)
        #The program returns b raised to the power of (m-2) modulo m
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts two parameters, `b` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the condition that `m > b`. The function first calls another function `func_8(b, m)` to get a value `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, the function immediately returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the result of `pow(b, m - 2, m)`, which is `b` raised to the power of `(m-2)` modulo `m`. The function can return either -1 or the specified modular exponentiation result based on the value of `g`. There are no additional actions or edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need to be considered beyond these two main outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is an integer, and m is a positive integer (m > 0).
def func_11(a, b, m):
    a = a % m
    inv = func_10(b, m)
    if (inv == -1) :
        return -999999999
        #The program returns -999999999
    else :
        return inv * a % m
        #`inv * a % m`, where `inv` is the value returned by `func_10(b, m)` and `a` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `m`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`, where `a` and `b` are integers, and `m` is a positive integer (i.e., `m > 0`). The function first computes the remainder of `a` when divided by `m` and assigns it back to `a`. It then calls another function `func_10(b, m)` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m`. If the modular inverse does not exist (i.e., `func_10(b, m)` returns `-1`), the function returns `-999999999`. Otherwise, it returns the product of the modular inverse (`inv`) and the remainder of `a` modulo `m`.

This covers all potential cases:
- If `func_10(b, m)` returns `-1`, indicating that the modular inverse does not exist, the function returns `-999999999`.
- If `func_10(b, m)` returns a valid inverse, the function computes and returns `inv * a % m`.

There are no missing functionalities mentioned in the provided code. The annotations accurately reflect the intended behavior of the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer representing the number of bags, n is an integer representing the number of patty-cakes in a bag, and a is a list of integers where each integer represents the filling of a patty-cake. Additionally, each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: T is an integer representing the number of bags, `n` is the number of patty-cakes processed in the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers representing the fillings of patty-cakes, `f` is an array of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` for `0 <= i < n` is the count of occurrences of `a[i]`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is the final result computed based on the conditions inside the loop, and `func_1()`, `func_6()`, and `func_13()` are functions whose exact behavior is not specified.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of patty-cakes distributed across multiple bags. For each bag, it counts the number of patty-cakes with the same filling and determines the minimum number of additional bags needed such that no bag contains more than one patty-cake with the same filling. The function iterates through each bag, sorts the list of patty-cakes, and computes the required number of additional bags using specific conditions. If a bag already satisfies the condition where no patty-cakes have the same filling, it skips further processing. The function ultimately returns the total number of additional bags needed across all bags, or 0 if no additional bags are needed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a variable-length argument list containing the values to be printed, sep is a string representing the separator between values (default is a space), file is an object with a write method to which the values will be written (default is sys.stdout), end is a string to be written after the last value (default is a newline), and flush is a boolean indicating whether the output stream should be flushed after writing (default is False).

        if not at_start:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is the list of arguments, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, all elements of `args` have been written to `sys.stdout` separated by spaces.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `args` is a list of arguments, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `end` is '\n'. If the key 'flush' exists in `kwargs` and its value is True, then `flush` is True. Otherwise, `flush` retains its previous value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts a variable-length argument list `args` and optional parameters `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It prints or writes the values of `args` to the specified output stream (`file` defaults to `sys.stdout`), using the specified separator (`sep` defaults to a space), appending the specified end character (`end` defaults to a newline), and optionally flushing the output stream (`flush` defaults to `False`). After executing, the function ensures that all elements of `args` are written to `file` separated by `sep`, followed by `end`, and if `flush` is `True`, the output stream is flushed.
