The function `func_6` takes no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_5()`. After the function concludes, the program state will be such that it returns a list of elements produced by `func_5()`. No additional actions are performed within `func_6` itself. If `func_5` returns an empty list or encounters any errors, `func_6` will simply return an empty list without further processing.
