The function `func_4()` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, which consists of multiple lines. Each line starts with an integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 100) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ \( 10^5 \), 1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( n \), and there exist at least two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( a_i = a_j \)). The function then processes this input by splitting the second part of each line into individual space-separated strings and returns a map object containing these strings. However, the function only processes the first line of the input, ignoring any subsequent lines. There is no missing functionality in terms of the described behavior; the edge case where multiple lines of input are provided is handled by processing only the first line.
