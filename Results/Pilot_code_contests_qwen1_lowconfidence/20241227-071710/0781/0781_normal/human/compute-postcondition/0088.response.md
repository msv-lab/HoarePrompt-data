The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `f`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ans` is as follows: if `s` equals 2, then `ans` is `n - 2`; otherwise, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`. The count of elements equal to 1 in `f` remains `n - 1`.**
