The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop. Since no loop context is provided, the value of the variables does not change due to the `continue` statement. The states of the variables `n`, `i`, `f`, `s`, and `ans` remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `f` remains an array of 100005 elements, each set to 0 except for the indices specified by the elements in `a`. The count of elements in `f` that are equal to 1 is `n - s`, and `ans` is equal to `n - 2` if `s == 2`, otherwise `ans` is equal to \((n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.**
