Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is equal to the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ans` is 1, `s` is equal to `n`, and the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is `n`. This holds true whether the condition `s == n` is met (in which case `func_13(0)` has been called) or not (in which case no additional changes occur).***
