Postcondition: **`args` must have at least two elements, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string, and if `not at_start`, a space (' ') has been written to `sys.stdout`.**
