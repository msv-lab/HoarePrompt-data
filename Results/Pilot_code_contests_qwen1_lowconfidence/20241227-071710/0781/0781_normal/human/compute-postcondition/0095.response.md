Functionality: **The function processes a list of patty-cakes distributed across multiple bags. For each bag, it counts the number of patty-cakes with the same filling and determines the minimum number of additional bags needed such that no bag contains more than one patty-cake with the same filling. The function iterates through each bag, sorts the list of patty-cakes, and computes the required number of additional bags using specific conditions. If a bag already satisfies the condition where no patty-cakes have the same filling, it skips further processing. The function ultimately returns the total number of additional bags needed across all bags, or 0 if no additional bags are needed.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If a bag already has no repeated patty-cakes (i.e., `s == n`), the function will skip further processing for that bag and move to the next one.
- If `f.count(1) == n - s` and `s == 2`, the function calculates `ans` as `n - s`.
- If `f.count(1) == n - s` and `s > 2`, the function calculates `ans` as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `func_1()`, `func_6()`, and `func_13()` are defined elsewhere and have specific behaviors. However, these functions' exact behaviors are not specified in the provided code, so their impact on the overall functionality cannot be fully summarized without additional information.
