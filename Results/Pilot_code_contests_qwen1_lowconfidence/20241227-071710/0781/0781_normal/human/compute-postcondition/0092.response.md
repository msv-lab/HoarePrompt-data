The function `func_13(ans)` is called with the argument `ans`. The value of `ans` is defined as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. However, there is no value given for `s`, and since `s` is not defined elsewhere in the provided code, its value remains unknown. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `ans`, which is set to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, and the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` remains `n - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` remains `n - 1`.**
