`n` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`. According to the initial state, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[j]` for `j` in range `n` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 1, `s` is the maximum value among the incremented elements at indices `a[j]` for `j` in range `n` and is equal to `n`, the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is 0**
