The function `func_13(ans)` is called, where `ans` is initially 1. However, the exact behavior of `func_13` is not specified in the given code snippet. Since no changes are made to the variables within this function call, the only thing that happens is the call to `func_13(ans)`. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[j]` for `j` in range `n` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 1, `s` is the maximum value among the incremented elements at indices `a[j]` for `j` in range `n` and is equal to `n`, the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is 0**
