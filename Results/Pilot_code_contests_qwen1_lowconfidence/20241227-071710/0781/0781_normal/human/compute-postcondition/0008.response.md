`at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `at_start` was either `False` or `True` depending on the condition, but now it is explicitly set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must have at least one element, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, `x` is converted to string and written to `sys.stdout`.
