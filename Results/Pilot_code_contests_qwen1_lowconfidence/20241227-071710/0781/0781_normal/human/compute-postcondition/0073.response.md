Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is equal to the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ans` is 1, `s` is equal to `n` and the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution:** The loop iterates over the range `n`, meaning it will execute exactly `n` times.
2. **Variable `i`:** After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1` and then exits.
3. **Array `a`:** `a` is an array of length `n`, and during each iteration, `f[a[i]]` is incremented. This means `f[j]` (where `j` is an element in `a`) will hold the count of occurrences of `j` in the first `n` elements of `a`.
4. **List `f`:** Since `f` is initialized with 100005 zeros, after the loop, `f[j]` will store the frequency of each `j` (where `j` is an element in `a`) appearing in the first `n` elements of `a`.
5. **Variables `ans`, `s`:** These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. `ans` is 1 and `s` is `n`.
6. **Count of Elements Equal to 1 in `f`:** Since `f` is initialized with zeros and no other elements are set to 1 within the loop, the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` remains 0, unless explicitly set otherwise, which is not the case here.

Thus, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`, `f` will contain the counts of elements in `a`, and `ans` and `s` will retain their original values.
