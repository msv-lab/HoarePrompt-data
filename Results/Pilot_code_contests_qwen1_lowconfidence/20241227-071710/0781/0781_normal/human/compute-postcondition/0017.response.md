The code writes the string representation of `x` to `file`, which is `sys.stdout`. This means a string representation of `x` is printed to the standard output. The variable `file` remains `sys.stdout`, `sep` remains `' '`, `at_start` remains `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, and `x` remains the next element in `args` converted to a string.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string, and a string representation of `x` is printed to `sys.stdout`.**
