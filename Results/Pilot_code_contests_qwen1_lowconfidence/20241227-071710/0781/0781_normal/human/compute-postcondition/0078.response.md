The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified, and given the context that `func_13(0)` has been called, we assume this is within a loop that was triggered by that function call. However, the exact loop structure is not provided, so we focus on the variables that could be affected by the `continue` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
- For each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is equal to the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`
- `ans` is 1
- `s` is equal to `n`
- The count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is `n`
- The condition `s == n` is true
- `func_13(0)` has been called

After executing `continue`, the loop will skip to the next iteration, but the values of the variables that were not altered by the loop body remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is equal to the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ans` is 1, `s` is equal to `n`, the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is `n`, and the condition `s == n` is true. `func_13(0)` has been called.**
