The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. Given that `sep` is `' '` (a space), this operation will write a space to `sys.stdout`. The other variables (`args`, `at_start`, `end`, `flush`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string, `sys.stdout` has a space written to it**
