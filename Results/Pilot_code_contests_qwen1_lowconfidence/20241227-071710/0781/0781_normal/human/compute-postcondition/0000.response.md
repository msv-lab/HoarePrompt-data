The given code snippet does not contain any executable statements; it only contains a docstring that provides documentation for the function. Therefore, no changes are made to the variables or their values. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **args is a variable-length argument list containing the values to be printed, sep is a string representing the separator between values (default is a space), file is an object with a write method to which the values will be written (default is sys.stdout), end is a string to be written after the last value (default is a newline), and flush is a boolean indicating whether the output stream should be flushed after writing (default is False).**
