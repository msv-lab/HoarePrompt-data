According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i < n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `f[a[0]]` is increased by 1
- `f[a[1]]` is increased by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must be less than `n`
- Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 (which is already given)

After the loop starts, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

Therefore, the new state should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1
- `f[a[0]]` remains increased by 1
- `f[a[1]]` remains increased by 1

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f[a[0]]` is increased by 1, `f[a[1]]` is increased by 1**
