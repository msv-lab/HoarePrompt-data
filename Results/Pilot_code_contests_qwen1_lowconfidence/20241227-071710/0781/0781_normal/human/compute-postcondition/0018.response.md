The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, which was its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must have at least one element, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string, and a string representation of `x` is printed to `sys.stdout`.
