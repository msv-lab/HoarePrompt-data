The function `func_13(ans)` is called with `ans` as an argument. Since no operation is performed within `func_13` and the function itself does not affect any variables outside of its scope, the value of `ans` is passed into the function but the actual function call does not modify any variables.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n`, where `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- For each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `ans` is calculated as follows: if `s` equals 2, then `ans` is `n - 2`; otherwise, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`. The count of elements equal to 1 in `f` remains `n - 1`.

Since `func_13` does not modify `ans` or any other variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ans` is as follows: if `s` equals 2, then `ans` is `n - 2`; otherwise, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`. The count of elements equal to 1 in `f` remains `n - 1`.**
