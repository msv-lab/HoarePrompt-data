The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of the other variables (`args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing the values to be printed, `sep` is a space, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, and `end` and `flush` retain their previous values.**
