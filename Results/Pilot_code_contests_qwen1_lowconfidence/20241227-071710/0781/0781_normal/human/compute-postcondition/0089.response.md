Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ans` is either `n - 2` if `s` equals 2, or `(n - 1) // 2 + 1` otherwise. The count of elements equal to 1 in `f` remains `n - 1`.***
