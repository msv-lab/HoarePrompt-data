`file.flush()` is called, which flushes the output buffer of the file object `file`. The value of `file` remains `sys.stdout`, and the value of `flush` is updated to `True` because flushing the buffer sets the `flush` attribute to `True`.

Output State: **`args` is the list of arguments, `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `end` is '\n', `flush` is True.**
