`at_start` is reassigned to `False`. The value of `at_start` was previously the boolean value `False`, and now it remains `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must have at least two elements, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string.
