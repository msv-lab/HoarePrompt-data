`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` (which is `' '` by default) to `file` (which is `sys.stdout` by default). This action does not change the values of `args`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `end`, or `flush`. It only affects the content written to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`args` must have at least two elements, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string, a space (' ') has been written to `sys.stdout`**
