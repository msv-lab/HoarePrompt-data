Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is equal to the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ans` is as follows: if `s` equals 2, then `ans` is `n - 2`; otherwise, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`. The count of elements equal to 1 in `f` remains `n - 1`.***
