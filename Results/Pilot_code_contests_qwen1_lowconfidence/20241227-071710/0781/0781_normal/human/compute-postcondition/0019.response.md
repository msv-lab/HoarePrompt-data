Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `args` is a variable-length argument list containing the values to be printed.
- `sep` is a space (`' '`).
- `file` is `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `True`.
- `end` and `flush` retain their previous values.

### Loop Code:
```python
for x in args:
    if not at_start:
        file.write(sep)
    file.write(str(x))
    at_start = False
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `x` is the first element in `args`.
   - `at_start` is initially `True`, so `file.write(sep)` is skipped.
   - `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is set to `False`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `x` is the second element in `args`.
   - `at_start` is `False`, so `file.write(sep)` writes the separator (`' '`) to `sys.stdout`.
   - `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is set to `False`.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `x` is the third element in `args`.
   - `at_start` is `False`, so `file.write(sep)` writes the separator (`' '`) to `sys.stdout`.
   - `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is set to `False`.

4. **General Iteration:**
   - For each subsequent element in `args`, the loop will write the separator followed by the string representation of the element, except for the first element which is written without a separator.

5. **Final State:**
   - After all iterations, the variable `at_start` will be `False` because it gets set to `False` in every iteration.
   - The `file` object will have written the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by spaces.
   - The `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` variables retain their original values.

### Output State:

- `args` is the same list of arguments passed to the function.
- `sep` is `' '`.
- `file` is `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `end` and `flush` retain their previous values.
- All elements of `args` have been written to `sys.stdout` separated by spaces.

Output State: **`args` is the list of arguments, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, all elements of `args` have been written to `sys.stdout` separated by spaces.**
