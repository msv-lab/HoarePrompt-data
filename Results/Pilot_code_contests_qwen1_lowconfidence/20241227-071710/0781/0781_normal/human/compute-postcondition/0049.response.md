Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[j]` for `j` in range `n` is incremented by 1, `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (0 + 1) + 1`, `s` is the maximum value among the incremented elements at indices `a[j]` for `j` in range `n`, and the value of `s` is equal to `n`. The count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is equal to `n - s`.**
