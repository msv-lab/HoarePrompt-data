The code writes the value of `sep` (which is `' '` by default) to the file `file` (which is `sys.stdout`). Since no changes are made to `args`, `at_start`, `end`, or `flush`, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must have at least one element, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`args` must have at least one element, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value**
