The function `func_13(ans)` is called with the argument `ans`. However, the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet, so no changes are made to the variables directly within this snippet. The values of the variables before the function call remain unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`.
- `f` remains an array of 100005 elements, each set to 0 except for the indices specified by the elements in `a`.
- The count of elements in `f` that are equal to 1 is `n - s`.
- `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1` if `s != 2`, otherwise it is equal to `(n - 1) // 3 + 1`.

Since `func_13(ans)` does not modify the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `f` remains an array of 100005 elements, each set to 0 except for the indices specified by the elements in `a`, the count of elements in `f` that are equal to 1 is `n - s`, and `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1` if `s != 2`, otherwise it is equal to `(n - 1) // 3 + 1**
