The function `func_13(ans)` is called with `ans` as the argument. Since the function call itself does not modify any variables and does not have a return value mentioned in the provided context, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `a` is the return value of `func_6()` sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[j]` for `j` in range `n` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 1 if `s` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ans` is `n - 2`, `s` is 2 if `s` is equal to 2, otherwise `s` is the maximum value among the incremented elements at indices `a[j]` for `j` in range `n` and is equal to `n`, the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is 0 if `s` is not equal to 2, otherwise it is `n - 2`.**
