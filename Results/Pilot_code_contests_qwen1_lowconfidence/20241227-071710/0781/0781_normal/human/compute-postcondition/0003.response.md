Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `args` list using the variable `x`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `args` is a variable-length argument list.
   - `sep` is a space (`' '`).
   - `file` is `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.
   - `end` and `flush` retain their previous values (though they are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state).

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `args` list.

4. **Adjusting States for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.
   - Since `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, `end`, and `flush` are either constants or retain their previous values, no changes are needed for these variables.
   - The initial value of `at_start` being `True` ensures that the first element of `args` will be printed without any leading separator.

### Final State for Loop Execution:
State: **`args` must have at least one element, `sep` is ' ', `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value**.
