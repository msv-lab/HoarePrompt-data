According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Additionally, since the loop body increases `f[a[0]]` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `f[a[0]]` will already have been incremented.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f[a[0]]` is increased by 1**
