Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `f` remains an array of 100005 elements, each set to 0 except for the indices specified by the elements in `a`. The count of elements in `f` that are equal to 1 is `n - s`, and `ans` is equal to `n - 2` if `s == 2`, otherwise `ans` is equal to \((n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.***
