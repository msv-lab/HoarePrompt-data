The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. Given the initial state, `file` is `sys.stdout`, so `x` is written to standard output. Since `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string, and no other changes are made to `x`, `x` remains the same. The `at_start` flag is set to `False`, meaning a space was written before this call to `write`, so no additional space is written here.

Output State: **`args` must have at least two elements, `sep` is `' '`, `file` is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False`, `end` retains its previous value, `flush` retains its previous value, `x` is the next element in `args` converted to a string, a space (' ') has been written to `sys.stdout` before this write operation.**
