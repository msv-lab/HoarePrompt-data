Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is equal to the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ans` is 1, `s` is equal to `n`. The count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is `n` and the condition `s == n` is true.***
