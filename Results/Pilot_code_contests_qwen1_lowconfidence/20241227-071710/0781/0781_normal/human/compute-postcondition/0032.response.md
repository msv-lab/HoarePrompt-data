The code `n = func_1()` assigns the value returned by `func_1()` to the variable `n`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. However, we know that `n` is a positive integer from the initial state.

The other variables (`i`, `f[a[i]]`, `f`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged in this line of code. Therefore, the only variable affected is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, `i` is `n + 1`, `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `f` remains an array of 100005 elements, each set to 0 except for the indices specified by the elements in `a`, the count of elements in `f` that are equal to 1 is `n - s`, and `ans` is equal to `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1` if `s != 2`, otherwise it is equal to `(n - 1) // 3 + 1`**.
