The function `func_13(0)` is called with an argument of 0. However, since no specific implementation of `func_13` is provided, we cannot determine what changes this function will make to the variables. Therefore, we can only state that the function call has occurred.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, for each index `j` in `a`, `f[j]` is equal to the number of times `j` appears in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ans` is 1, `s` is equal to `n`, the count of elements equal to 1 in `f` is `n`, and the condition `s == n` is true. `func_13(0)` has been called.**
