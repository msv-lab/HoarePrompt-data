The function `func_12` accepts the following parameters:
- `T`: An integer representing the number of bags.
- `n`: An integer representing the number of patty-cakes in a bag.
- `a`: A list of integers where each integer represents the filling of a patty-cake.

Additionally, each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of `n` over all bags does not exceed \(10^5\).

Based on the given conditions, the function will determine if there are any patty-cakes with the same filling in any of the bags and return a boolean value accordingly. However, since the output is not specified in detail, we can only describe the parameters and the basic structure of the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `T`, `n`, and `a`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any patty-cakes with the same filling in any of the bags.**
