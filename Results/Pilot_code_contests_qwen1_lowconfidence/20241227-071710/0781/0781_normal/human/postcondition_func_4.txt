The function `func_5()` reads a single line of user input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element into an integer. It then returns a map object containing these integers. This function does not accept any parameters and relies on standard input. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or non-integer values in the input. If the input is empty, the map object will be empty. If non-integer values are entered, they will raise a `ValueError` which is not caught within this function.
