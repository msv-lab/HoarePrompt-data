The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where both are non-negative integers and `y` is not zero. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop, `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. If either `x` or `y` is 0 initially, the function still performs the necessary operations to ensure the correct GCD is returned. If `x` is 0 and `y` is not, the GCD will be `y`. If `y` is 0 and `x` is not, the GCD will be `x`. If both are 0, the function will handle this case appropriately by ensuring `x` (the GCD) is 0 after the loop.
