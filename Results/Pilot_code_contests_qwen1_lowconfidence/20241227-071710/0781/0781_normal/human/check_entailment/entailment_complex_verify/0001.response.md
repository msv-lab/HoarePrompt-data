Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Upon reviewing the annotated code, it is clear that the logic in `func_12` does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the function sorts the patty-cakes in reverse order and uses a simplistic approach to determine the maximum minimum distance between eaten patty-cakes with the same filling. This approach does not account for all possible reorderings of the patty-cakes, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 1 3
```

The expected output is 1, but the current implementation might not produce this result due to its flawed logic. The annotated version confirms that the function does not handle the problem correctly, hence the original assessment remains valid.
