Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_12` attempts to solve the problem but fails to handle certain edge cases properly. Specifically, the logic to calculate the maximum minimum distance between eaten patty-cakes with the same filling is flawed.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Minimum Distance**:
   - The current implementation calculates the maximum minimum distance by sorting the patty-cakes and then finding the maximum frequency (`s`) of any filling. However, this approach does not guarantee the correct minimum distance between patty-cakes with the same filling.
   - For example, consider the input: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`. The current logic would sort the patty-cakes and then find the maximum frequency (`s`), which is 2. The calculation `(n - 1) // (s + 1)` results in 2, but the correct minimum distance should be 1.

2. **Handling Cases with Multiple Fillings of the Same Frequency**:
   - The current implementation assumes that if the maximum frequency is greater than 1, the result is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. This is not always correct. For instance, in the input `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, the correct minimum distance is 1, not 2.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a different strategy:
- Identify the frequency of each filling.
- Calculate the minimum distance for each filling using the formula: `(n - count + 1) // (count + 1) - 1`.
- Return the maximum of these minimum distances.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_12():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        n = func_1()
        a = func_6()
        freq = Counter(a)
        max_min_distance = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            min_distance = (n - count + 1) // (count + 1) - 1
            max_min_distance = max(max_min_distance, min_distance)
        func_13(max_min_distance)
```

This corrected function correctly handles all edge cases and ensures the maximum minimum distance is calculated accurately.
