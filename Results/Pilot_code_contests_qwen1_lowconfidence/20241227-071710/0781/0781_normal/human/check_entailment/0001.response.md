Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_12` attempts to calculate the largest minimum distance between eaten patty-cakes with the same filling, but it has a flaw in its logic.

### Example Case where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
The largest minimum distance between eaten patty-cakes with the same filling is 1. This can be achieved by eating the patty-cakes in the order: 1, 2, 1, 3.

However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. The logic for calculating the maximum minimum distance is flawed and does not consider the optimal ordering of patty-cakes.

### Why the Program Fails:
- The program sorts the patty-cakes in reverse order (`a.sort(reverse=True)`), which does not necessarily lead to the optimal solution.
- The logic for determining the maximum minimum distance is overly simplistic and does not account for all possible reorderings of the patty-cakes.

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to produce the correct output for at least one potential case, the correctness of the program is **False**.
