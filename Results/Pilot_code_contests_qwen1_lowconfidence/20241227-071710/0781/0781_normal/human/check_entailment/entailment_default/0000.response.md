Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_12` does not correctly implement the logic to find the largest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling. Specifically, the function does not handle the case where the maximum frequency of any filling (`s`) is equal to the number of patty-cakes (`n`). In such a case, the minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling should be 0, but the function incorrectly calculates it.

Here is a detailed explanation:

1. The function reads the number of bags and the details of each bag.
2. For each bag, it sorts the list of patty-cakes.
3. It then counts the frequency of each filling using the array `f`.
4. It determines the maximum frequency `s` of any filling.
5. If `s` is equal to `n`, it means that each filling appears exactly once, and the minimum distance is 0. However, the function continues to the next condition instead of immediately returning 0.

The relevant part of the code is:
```python
if s == n:
    func_13(0)
    continue
```
If `s == n`, the function should return 0, but it does not do so. Instead, it proceeds to the next block of code, which is not appropriate for this case.

Therefore, the function does not correctly handle the case where the maximum frequency of any filling is equal to the number of patty-cakes, leading to incorrect outputs for such cases.
