Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code in `func_12` does not correctly implement the logic to find the largest minimum distance between eaten patty-cakes with the same filling. Specifically, the code calculates the number of additional bags needed rather than finding the largest minimum distance between patty-cakes with the same filling.

To illustrate why the code is incorrect, consider the following example:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  7
  1 7 1 6 4 4 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  3
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The code will output a value related to the number of additional bags needed, which is not the expected result.

The code logic in `func_12` involves sorting the list of patty-cakes and then counting the occurrences of each filling. It then calculates the number of additional bags needed, which does not align with the requirement to find the largest minimum distance between patty-cakes with the same filling.

To fix this, the code should focus on finding the optimal order of eating the patty-cakes to maximize the minimum distance between patty-cakes with the same filling. This involves calculating the gaps between the same fillings in all possible orders and determining the maximum of these gaps.
