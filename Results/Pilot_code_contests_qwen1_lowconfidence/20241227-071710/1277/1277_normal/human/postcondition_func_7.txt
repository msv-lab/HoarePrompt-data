The function `func_8` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `y` is not zero. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the loop, the function returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The state of the program after the function concludes is such that `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. This process handles the case where `y` is zero by terminating the loop early, ensuring that the function correctly computes the GCD even when one of the inputs is zero initially.
