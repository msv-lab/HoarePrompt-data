The function accepts no parameters and waits for user input. It then returns the input as a floating-point number. This function does not modify any external variables and relies on user interaction to provide the input. Potential edge cases include invalid input types (e.g., non-numeric strings) which would result in a `ValueError`. The function does not handle these cases and will raise an exception if the user inputs something other than a valid floating-point number.
