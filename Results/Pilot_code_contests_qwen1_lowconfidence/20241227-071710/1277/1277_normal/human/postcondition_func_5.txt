The function `func_6` takes no explicit parameters and returns a list generated by calling `func_5()`. Given the preconditions and guarantees about the inputs and internal state before `func_5()` is called, the function does not alter any external variables directly. Instead, it leverages the output of `func_5()` to produce its own return value. The returned list is derived from `func_5()`'s behavior, which is not detailed in the given information. Therefore, the final state of the program after `func_6` concludes is that it has returned a list whose contents depend entirely on the implementation of `func_5()`. Since no direct operations on input lists `a` and `b` are performed within `func_6`, these lists remain unchanged.
