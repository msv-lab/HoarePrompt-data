The function `func_4` reads a line of space-separated input from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing the individual input strings as separate elements. There are no parameters passed to the function. This means the function is designed to take any number of space-separated words as input and return them as a map object where each word is a key and mapped to itself. Potential edge cases include empty input or multiple consecutive spaces between words, which will result in single or multiple empty strings in the output map object.
