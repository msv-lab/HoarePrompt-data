The function reads an integer `n` from the first line of stdin, followed by two lines of space-separated integers representing arrays `a` and `b`. It then returns a map object containing the integers from the second line of input split by spaces. There are no parameters passed to the function. Note that the function does not process the first array `a`, only the second array `b`. Additionally, the returned map object contains the integers directly without any further transformation or validation.
