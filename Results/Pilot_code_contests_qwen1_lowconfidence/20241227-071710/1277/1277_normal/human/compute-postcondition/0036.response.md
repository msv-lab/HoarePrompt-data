`a[l1[i][1]]` is updated to `a[l1[i][1]] + l1[i][0]`. Given that `l1[i][0]` is `i + 2` and `l1[i][1]` is `i`, the expression simplifies to updating `a[i]` to `a[i] + i + 2`.

The initial state values remain unchanged except for `a[i]`, which is updated. The output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is `a[i] + i + 2`, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end]` to itself, and `l2` is a list containing `[i + 2, l1[i][1] + 1]` if `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`. If `b[l1[i][1]] <= 0`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
