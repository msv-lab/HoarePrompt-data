The code sets `at_start` to `False`. This updates the value of `at_start` but does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two elements, `at_start` is `False`, the next `x` is written to the file as a string, and either `sep` is written to the file again or remains unchanged; the file now contains the string representation of `x`**
