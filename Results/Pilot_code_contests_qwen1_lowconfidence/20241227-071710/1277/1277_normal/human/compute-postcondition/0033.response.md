The code appends `l1[i][1] + 1` to `l2`. Given that `l1[i][1]` is an index in the range `[0, n-1]`, the value being appended to `l2` is an integer in the range `[1, n]`. However, the specific value depends on the current value of `l1[i][1]`. 

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `i` remains `i_end + 1`.
- `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `b` remains a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or `-1`.
- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `l` remains a list of `n` zeros.
- `l1` remains a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`.
- `ans` remains updated based on the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`.
- `l2` gains a new element, which is `l1[i][1] + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or `-1`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `ans` is updated based on the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, and `l2` is a list containing `[i + 2, l1[i][1] + 1]`.**
