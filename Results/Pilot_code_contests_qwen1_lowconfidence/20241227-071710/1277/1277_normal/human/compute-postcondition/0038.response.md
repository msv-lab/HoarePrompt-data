The code `l2.append(l1[i][1] + 1)` appends the value of `l1[i][1] + 1` to the list `l2`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the current scope, and it's unclear from the initial state what `i` should be. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact value to append to `l2`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i_end + 2`
- `a[i_end + 2]` is updated (but no specific value is given)
- `l` is a list of `n` zeros
- `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`
- `l2[i_end + 2]` is `[i_end + 4, l1[i_end + 2][1] + 1]` if `b[2] > 0`, otherwise it remains the same
- `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end + 1]` to itself

Since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value to append. Therefore, the only variable that is directly impacted by the code is `l2`, which gets an additional element.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `a[i_end + 2]` is updated, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `l2[i_end + 2]` is `[i_end + 4, l1[i_end + 2][1] + 1]` if `b[2] > 0`, otherwise it remains the same, `l2` has an additional element `l1[i][1] + 1`, `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end + 1]` to itself**.
