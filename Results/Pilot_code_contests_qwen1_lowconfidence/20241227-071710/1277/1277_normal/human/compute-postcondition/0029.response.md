The code `ans += a[l1[i][1]]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `a[l1[i][1]]`. Here, `l1[i][1]` is the second element of the i-th sublist in `l1`, which is `[0, i]`. Therefore, `a[l1[i][1]]` is equivalent to `a[i]`.

The value of `ans` is updated, but the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or `-1`, the sequence defined by `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, ...` always ends with `-1`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `ans` is `ans + a[i]`, `l2` is a list containing `[i + 1]`.**
