The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This operation does not affect the variables `args`, `at_start`, or `sep`. It only updates the file content.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is written to the file as a string, and a value of `sep` is written to the file. The file now contains `str(x)`.**
