The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding `a[l1[i][1]]` to itself. Let's analyze the variables involved:

- `i` is `i_end + 2`.
- `a[i_end + 2]` is updated (but its new value is not specified).
- `l` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`.
- `l2[i_end + 2]` is `[i_end + 4, l1[i_end + 2][1] + 1]` if `b[2] > 0`, otherwise it remains the same.
- `l2` has an additional element `l1[i][1] + 1`.
- `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end + 1]` to itself.

The specific part of the code `ans += a[l1[i][1]]` implies that `ans` is incremented by the value of `a[l1[i][1]]`. Since `i` is `i_end + 2`, `l1[i][1]` is `i_end + 2`.

Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `a[i_end + 2]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `a[i_end + 2]` is updated, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `l2[i_end + 2]` is `[i_end + 4, l1[i_end + 2][1] + 1]` if `b[2] > 0`, otherwise it remains the same, `l2` has an additional element `l1[i][1] + 1`, `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end + 2]` to itself**.
