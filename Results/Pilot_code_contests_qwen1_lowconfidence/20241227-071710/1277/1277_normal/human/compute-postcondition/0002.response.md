The variable `at_start` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, and `file` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers representing the values to be printed; `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file'; `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` if 'sep' was in `kwargs` or the string `' '; `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` if 'file' was in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is `True`.
