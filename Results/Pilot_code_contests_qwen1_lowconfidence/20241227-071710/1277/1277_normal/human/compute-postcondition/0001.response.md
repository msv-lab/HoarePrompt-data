The code `sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)` pops the 'sep' and 'file' keys from the `kwargs` dictionary with default values if the keys are not present. The values are then assigned to `sep` and `file` respectively. 

- The `kwargs` dictionary now no longer contains the 'sep' and 'file' keys since they have been popped.
- `sep` is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('sep', ' ')`, which means if 'sep' was in `kwargs`, `sep` will get its value; otherwise, `sep` is set to the string `' '`.
- `file` is assigned the value of `kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)`, which means if 'file' was in `kwargs`, `file` will get its value; otherwise, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers representing the values to be printed; `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file'; `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` if 'sep' was in `kwargs` or the string `' '; `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` if 'file' was in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.**
