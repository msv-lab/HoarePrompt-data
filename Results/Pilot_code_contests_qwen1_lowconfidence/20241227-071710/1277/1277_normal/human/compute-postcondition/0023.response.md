Postcondition: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers, `at_start` is `False`, `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `\n`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, then `file.flush()` has been called. Otherwise, no changes are made to the file.**
