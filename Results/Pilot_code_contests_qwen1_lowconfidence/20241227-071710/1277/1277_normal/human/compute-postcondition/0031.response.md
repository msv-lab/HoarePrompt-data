The code updates the value of `a[l1[i][1]]` by adding `l1[i][0]` to it. Given that `l1` is defined as `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `l1[i][1]` is `i` and `l1[i][0]` is `0`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to updating `a[i]` by adding `0` to it, which means `a[i]` remains unchanged.

Other variables are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or `-1`, the sequence defined by `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, ...` always ends with `-1`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `ans` is `ans + a[i]` if `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `b[l1[i][1]] <= 0`, `l2` is a list containing `[i + 1]`, `a[i]` is unchanged.**
