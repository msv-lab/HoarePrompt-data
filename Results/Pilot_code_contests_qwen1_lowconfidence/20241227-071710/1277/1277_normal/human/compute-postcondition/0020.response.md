The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` has the following impacts:
- It writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to the file `file`. 
- The value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is either the value passed as the 'end' key in `kwargs` or the default value `\n` if no 'end' key is present in `kwargs`.

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `kwargs`, we consider the default case where `kwargs` might not contain the 'end' key. In this case, `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` would be `\n`. 

Therefore, the value `\n` is written to `file`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers, `at_start` is `False`, `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `\n`.**
