`ans` is updated by adding the value of `a[l1[i][1]]` to itself. The value of `i` is `i_end + 1`, so `l1[i][1]` is `i_end`. Since `b[l1[i][1]]` is checked to be greater than 0 and `a` and `b` are defined, `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end]` to itself. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end]` to itself, and `l2` is a list containing `[i + 2, l1[i][1] + 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end]` to itself, and `l2` is a list containing `[i + 2, l1[i][1] + 1]`.**
