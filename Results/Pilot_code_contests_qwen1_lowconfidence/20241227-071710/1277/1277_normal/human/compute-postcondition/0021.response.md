Postcondition: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers, `at_start` is `False`, `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `\n`. The call to `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` has been made, but the value of `flush` is not specified, indicating that the `flush` parameter was either not provided or explicitly set to `False` in `kwargs`.**
