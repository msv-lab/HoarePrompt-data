The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. This operation does not affect the variables `args`, `at_start`, or `x`. Therefore, the only change is that `sep` is written to the file.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two elements, `at_start` is `False`, the next `x` is written to the file as a string, and `sep` is written to the file.**
