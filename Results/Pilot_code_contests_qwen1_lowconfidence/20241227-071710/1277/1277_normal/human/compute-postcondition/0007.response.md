The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` into the file `file`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, we will keep it as `x`. The variable `args` is not affected by this operation, and if `at_start` is `False`, the function does nothing, which means its state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, and if `at_start` is `False`, the function does nothing; `x` is written to the file as a string.**
