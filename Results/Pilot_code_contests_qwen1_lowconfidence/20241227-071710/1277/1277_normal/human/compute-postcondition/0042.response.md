Let's analyze the loop step by step and deduce the final state of the variables after all iterations have executed.

### Initial State
- \(i\) is \(n\)
- \(n\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- \(b\) is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and \(n\) or \(-1\), and the sequence defined by \(b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, \ldots\) always ends with \(-1\)
- \(a\) is a list of integers
- \(l\) is a list of \(n\) zeros
- \(l1\) is a list containing \([[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], \ldots, [0, n-1]]\)
- \(ans\) is 0
- \(l2\) is an empty list

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(n):
    l2.append(l1[i][1] + 1)
    if b[l1[i][1]] > 0:
        ans += a[l1[i][1]]
    a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]
```

### Analysis of Loop Execution

1. **First Iteration (i = 0):**
   - \(l2.append(l1[0][1] + 1) \rightarrow l2.append(1)\)
   - If \(b[0] > 0\):
     - \(ans += a[0]\)
     - \(a[0] += l1[0][0]\)

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - \(l2.append(l1[1][1] + 1) \rightarrow l2.append(2)\)
   - If \(b[1] > 0\):
     - \(ans += a[1]\)
     - \(a[1] += l1[1][0]\)

3. **Third Iteration (i = 2):**
   - \(l2.append(l1[2][1] + 1) \rightarrow l2.append(3)\)
   - If \(b[2] > 0\):
     - \(ans += a[2]\)
     - \(a[2] += l1[2][0]\)

... and so on until the loop completes.

### Final State After All Iterations

- \(i\) will be equal to \(n\).
- \(n\) remains unchanged.
- \(b\) remains unchanged.
- \(l\) remains unchanged.
- \(l1\) remains unchanged.
- \(ans\) is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
- \(l2\) will be a list containing all the indices \(i + 1\) where \(b[i] > 0\).

To summarize, the value of \(ans\) will be the sum of \(a[j]\) for all \(j\) such that \(b[j] > 0\). The values of \(a[i]\) will be incremented according to the rules specified in the loop. The list \(l2\) will contain the updated indices as described.

### Output State

**Output State:**  
- \(i = n\)
- \(n\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- \(b\) is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and \(n\) or \(-1\), and the sequence defined by \(b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, \ldots\) always ends with \(-1\)
- \(a\) is a list of integers where \(a[i]\) is updated based on the conditions inside the loop
- \(l\) is a list of \(n\) zeros
- \(l1\) is a list containing \([[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], \ldots, [0, n-1]]\)
- \(ans\) is the sum of \(a[j]\) for all \(j\) such that \(b[j] > 0\)
- \(l2\) is a list containing all indices \(i + 1\) where \(b[i] > 0\)

**Output State:**  
**`i = n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or \(-1\), the sequence defined by `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, ...` always ends with \(-1\), `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `ans` is the sum of `a[j]` for all `j` such that `b[j] > 0`, and `l2` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where `b[i] > 0`.**
