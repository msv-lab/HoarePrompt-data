Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop**: The given for loop iterates over each element in the `args` variable-length argument list.

2. **Identify Necessary Variables for the Loop**:
   - `x`: This variable will take on the value of each element in `args` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `args`: This is the list that the loop will iterate over. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.

3. **Current States**:
   - `args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers representing the values to be printed.
   - `kwargs` does not contain 'sep' and 'file'.
   - `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` if 'sep' was in `kwargs` or the string `' '`.
   - `file` is either the value of `kwargs['file']` if 'file' was in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`.
   - `at_start` is `True`.

4. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will only execute if `args` contains at least one integer. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `args` is not empty.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `args` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute as long as they are in their current states (as specified).

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is:

**State: **`args` must contain at least one element**.
