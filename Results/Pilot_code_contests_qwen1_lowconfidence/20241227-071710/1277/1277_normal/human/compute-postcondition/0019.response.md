Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers, `at_start` is `False`, `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `at_start` is set to `True`, and as the loop iterates, it becomes `False`.
- For each iteration, `x` (an element from `args`) is converted to a string and written to `file`. 
- If it's not the first element (`not at_start`), `sep` is also written to `file` before writing `x`.

Since the loop runs through all elements in `args`, the final state of `file` will contain all the string representations of the elements in `args` separated by `sep`. `at_start` remains `False` after the loop completes because the loop starts with `at_start` being `False` and never gets reset to `True` within the loop.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `args` is empty), `at_start` remains `True` (or its original value if it was not modified externally), and `file` remains in its initial state (which could be `sys.stdout` or any other default value). However, since no elements are written, `file` effectively remains unchanged in terms of content.
