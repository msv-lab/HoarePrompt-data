The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers such that \(-10^6 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\), and `b` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq b_i \leq n\) or \(b_i = -1\), with the condition that the sequence \(b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, \ldots\) always ends with -1.

Case_1: The function does not specify any direct return values from the given information, but rather processes the lists `a` and `b` according to the described conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_12` is to accept parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` as defined above.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers such that \(-10^6 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\), and `b` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq b_i \leq n\) or \(b_i = -1\), with the sequence \(b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, \ldots\) always ending with -1.**
