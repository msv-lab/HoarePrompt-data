`at_start` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `args`, `x`, and `sep` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is written to the file as a string, and a value of `sep` is written to the file. The file now contains `str(x)`.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is written to the file as a string, and a value of `sep` is written to the file. The file now contains `str(x)`.**
