Postcondition: ***`i` is `i_end + 2`, `a[i_end + 2]` is updated, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `l2[i_end + 2]` is `[i_end + 4, l1[i_end + 2][1] + 1]` if `b[2] > 0`, otherwise it remains the same, `l2` has an additional element `l1[i][1] + 1`, `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end + 2]` to itself, and this updating happens if and only if `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`.***
