The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file. This affects the `file` object, but does not change the values of `args`, `at_start`, or `sep`. The output state remains the same in terms of these variables, but the file now contains the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least two elements, `at_start` is `False`, the next `x` is written to the file as a string, and either `sep` is written to the file again or remains unchanged; the file now contains the string representation of `x`**
