Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `b` is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or `-1`.
   - The sequence defined by `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, ...` always ends with `-1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`.
   - `ans` is updated by `ans + a[i]` if `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, and remains unchanged if `b[l1[i][1]] <= 0`.
   - `l2` is a list containing `[i + 1]`.
   - `a[i]` is unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `i_end` (where `i_end < n`).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_end + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `b` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `a` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `l` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `l1` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` may be updated based on the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, but we need to consider the next value of `i` to determine this.
   - `l2` will be updated to `[i_end + 2]` for the next iteration.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to `i_end + 1`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `i`, but without the actual loop body, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`.
   - Other states (`n`, `b`, `a`, `l`, `l1`, `l2`) remain the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or `-1`, the sequence defined by `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, ...` always ends with `-1`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `ans` is updated based on the condition `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`, and `l2` is a list containing `[i + 2]`**.
