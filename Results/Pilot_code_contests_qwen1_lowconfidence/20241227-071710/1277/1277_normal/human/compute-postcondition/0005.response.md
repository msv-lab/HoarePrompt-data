`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file, but does not change the value of `sep` itself or any other variable. The variable `at_start` remains `False` and the content of `args` is unchanged since no elements are being added, removed, or modified.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`**
