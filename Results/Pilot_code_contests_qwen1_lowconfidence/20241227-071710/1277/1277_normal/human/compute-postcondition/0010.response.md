`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file. However, the value of `sep` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value that will be written to the file. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is written to the file as a string, a value of `sep` is written to the file.**
