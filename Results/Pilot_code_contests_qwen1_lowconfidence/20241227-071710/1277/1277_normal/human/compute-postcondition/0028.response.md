Postcondition: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or `-1`, the sequence defined by `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, ...` always ends with `-1`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `ans` is 0, `l2` is a list containing `[i + 1]`. The current value of `b[l1[i][1]]` is greater than 0.**
