The code `file.flush()` is called, which flushes the file buffer, ensuring that all pending writes are written to the file. However, the state of the `flush` parameter from `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` remains unchanged since the actual value of `flush` is not specified in the given context. The other variables `args`, `at_start`, and `file` remain in their original states.

Output State: **`args` is a variable-length argument list containing integers, `at_start` is `False`, `file` contains the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by `\n`, and `file.flush()` has been called.**
