The function `func_13(*l2)` is called with the unpacked list `l2`. This means that `l2` is passed as multiple arguments to the function `func_13`. However, without knowing the exact definition of `func_13` or the contents of `l2`, we cannot determine the specific changes made to `ans`. The only information we know is that `ans` was modified by the function `func_13(ans)`, and now `func_13(*l2)` is being called, which might modify `ans` again in an unspecified way.

Given this, the output state remains that `ans` has been modified by both `func_13(ans)` and `func_13(*l2)`, but we do not have enough information to specify the exact value of `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` has been modified by both `func_13(ans)` and `func_13(*l2)`**
