Let's break down the problem step by step to understand how the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `b` is a list of integers
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is `a[i] + i + 2`
- `l` is a list of `n` zeros
- `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`
- `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end]` to itself
- `l2` is a list containing `[i + 2, l1[i][1] + 1]` if `b[l1[i][1]] > 0`. If `b[l1[i][1]] <= 0`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

### Loop Iteration Analysis:
The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Increment of `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts from `i_end + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 2`.
   
2. **List `a`:**
   - For each `i`, `a[i]` is updated as `a[i] + i + 2`.
   - Since we are moving to the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 2`, and thus `a[i_end + 2]` will be updated accordingly.
   
3. **List `l`:**
   - `l` remains a list of `n` zeros.
   
4. **List `l1`:**
   - `l1` is a fixed list and does not change during the loop execution.
   
5. **List `l2`:**
   - The condition for updating `l2` depends on `b[l1[i][1]]`. 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_end + 1`. Now, `i` will be `i_end + 2`.
   - We need to check the value of `b[l1[i_end + 2][1]]` (i.e., `b[2]` since `l1[i][1] = i`) to determine the value of `l2[i_end + 2]`.

6. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end]` to itself.
   - For the next iteration, `ans` will be updated by adding `a[i_end + 1]` to itself.

### Updated States for the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `i_end + 2`.
- `a[i_end + 2]` will be updated based on the previous update rule.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `l1` remains unchanged.
- The value of `l2[i_end + 2]` will depend on the value of `b[2]`.
- `ans` will be updated by adding `a[i_end + 1]` to itself.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `a[i_end + 2]` is updated based on the rule `a[i] = a[i] + i + 2`, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `l2[i_end + 2]` is `[i_end + 2 + 2, l1[i_end + 2][1] + 1]` if `b[l1[i_end + 2][1]] > 0` (i.e., `b[2] > 0`), otherwise it remains the same as the previous state, `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end + 1]` to itself.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `a[i_end + 2]` is updated, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `l1` is a list containing `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], ..., [0, n-1]]`, `l2[i_end + 2]` is `[i_end + 4, l1[i_end + 2][1] + 1]` if `b[2] > 0`, otherwise it remains the same, `ans` is updated by adding `a[i_end + 1]` to itself.**
