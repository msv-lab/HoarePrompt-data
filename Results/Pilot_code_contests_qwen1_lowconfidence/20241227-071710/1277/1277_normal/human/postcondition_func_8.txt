The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the integer result of `x` multiplied by `y`, then performs integer division by the result of calling another function `func_8` with the same arguments `x` and `y`. The function returns the final computed value. Potential edge cases include when `func_8(x, y)` returns zero, which would result in a division by zero error. Additionally, if either `x` or `y` is zero, the multiplication `x * y` could result in zero, leading to a division by `func_8(x, y)`'s result, which might also be zero.
