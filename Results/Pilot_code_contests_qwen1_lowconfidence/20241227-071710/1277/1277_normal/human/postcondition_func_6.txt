The function reads input from a file named 'input.txt' and writes output to a file named 'output.txt'. It processes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `a` (a list of integers), and `b` (a list of integers). For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it follows the chain defined by `b[i]` until it reaches `-1`, and then collects the indices involved in this chain. It returns a list containing the collected indices for each chain.
