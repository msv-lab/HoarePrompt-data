The input is a set of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), representing the length of the arrays a and b. The second line contains n integers a_i (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), representing the elements of array a. The third line contains n integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1), representing the elements of array b. Additionally, it's guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic and ends with -1.
