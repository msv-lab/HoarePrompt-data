Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the case where the value of `b[i]` is `0`. According to the problem description, `b_i` can be either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or `-1`, with the sequence defined by `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, ...` always ending with `-1`. However, the code only updates `l[b[i] - 1]` when `b[i] > 0`. This means that when `b[i]` is `0`, the corresponding value in `a` is not correctly propagated through the chain defined by `b`. 

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
n = 4
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = [0, 2, -1, 3]
```

According to the problem description, the value at index `0` in `b` is `0`, so the value `1` in `a` at index `0` should not be added to any other value in `a`. However, the current code will incorrectly add `1` to `l[1]` (since `b[0] - 1 = 0` and `0 < 4`), which is not the intended behavior.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and thus the correctness is **False**.
