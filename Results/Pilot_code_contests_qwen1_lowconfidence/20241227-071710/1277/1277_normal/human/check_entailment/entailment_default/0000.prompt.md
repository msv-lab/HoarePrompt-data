You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Captain Fint is involved in another treasure hunt, but have found only one strange problem. The problem may be connected to the treasure's location or may not. That's why captain Flint decided to leave the solving the problem to his crew and offered an absurdly high reward: one day off. The problem itself sounds like this...

There are two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, an ans is equal to 0 and the following operation is defined: 

  1. Choose position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); 
  2. Add a_i to ans; 
  3. If b_i ≠ -1 then add a_i to a_{b_i}. 



What is the maximum ans you can get by performing the operation on each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) exactly once?

Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of arrays a and b.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1).

Additional constraint: it's guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic, in other words it will always end with -1.

Output

In the first line, print the maximum ans you can get.

In the second line, print the order of operations: n different integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n). The p_i is the position which should be chosen at the i-th step. If there are multiple orders, print any of them.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function prompts the user to provide an integer input and returns that integer. There are no preconditions specified for the type of input other than it being an integer. The function does not perform any additional operations or validations on the input. If the user inputs a non-integer value, the program will raise an error since the `input()` function in Python returns a string, which cannot be directly converted to an integer without appropriate handling.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return float(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and waits for user input. It then returns the input as a floating-point number. This function does not modify any external variables and relies on user interaction to provide the input. Potential edge cases include invalid input types (e.g., non-numeric strings) which would result in a `ValueError`. The function does not handle these cases and will raise an exception if the user inputs something other than a valid floating-point number.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and prompts the user for input. It then returns this input. There are no preconditions or postconditions specified within the code itself, but based on the given information, the function simply reads input from the user and returns it. This means that the function essentially acts as a placeholder for user input, which could be of any type (string, number, etc.). No further processing of the input is performed by the function.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads a line of space-separated input from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing the individual input strings as separate elements. There are no parameters passed to the function. This means the function is designed to take any number of space-separated words as input and return them as a map object where each word is a key and mapped to itself. Potential edge cases include empty input or multiple consecutive spaces between words, which will result in single or multiple empty strings in the output map object.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads an integer `n` from the first line of stdin, followed by two lines of space-separated integers representing arrays `a` and `b`. It then returns a map object containing the integers from the second line of input split by spaces. There are no parameters passed to the function. Note that the function does not process the first array `a`, only the second array `b`. Additionally, the returned map object contains the integers directly without any further transformation or validation.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return list(func_5())
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` takes no explicit parameters and returns a list generated by calling `func_5()`. Given the preconditions and guarantees about the inputs and internal state before `func_5()` is called, the function does not alter any external variables directly. Instead, it leverages the output of `func_5()` to produce its own return value. The returned list is derived from `func_5()`'s behavior, which is not detailed in the given information. Therefore, the final state of the program after `func_6` concludes is that it has returned a list whose contents depend entirely on the implementation of `func_5()`. Since no direct operations on input lists `a` and `b` are performed within `func_6`, these lists remain unchanged.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads input from a file named 'input.txt' and writes output to a file named 'output.txt'. It processes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `a` (a list of integers), and `b` (a list of integers). For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it follows the chain defined by `b[i]` until it reaches `-1`, and then collects the indices involved in this chain. It returns a list containing the collected indices for each chain.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where `y` is not zero. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. After executing the loop, the function returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The state of the program after the function concludes is such that `x` contains the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. This process handles the case where `y` is zero by terminating the loop early, ensuring that the function correctly computes the GCD even when one of the inputs is zero initially.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x, y):
    return x * y // func_8(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It calculates the integer result of `x` multiplied by `y`, then performs integer division by the result of calling another function `func_8` with the same arguments `x` and `y`. The function returns the final computed value. Potential edge cases include when `func_8(x, y)` returns zero, which would result in a division by zero error. Additionally, if either `x` or `y` is zero, the multiplication `x * y` could result in zero, leading to a division by `func_8(x, y)`'s result, which might also be zero.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(b, m):
    g = func_8(b, m)
    if g != 1:
        return -1
    else:
        return pow(b, m - 2, m)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts two parameters `b` and `m`. `b` is an integer such that \(1 < b < 2 \times 10^5\) and is coprime with \(m\), and `m` is an integer such that \(m > 1\). The function first calls another function `func_8` with the same parameters `b` and `m`. If the result `g` from `func_8` is not equal to 1, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns the value of \(b^{m-2} \mod m\).
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(a, b, m):
    a = a % m
    inv = func_10(b, m)
    if inv == -1:
        return -999999999
    else:
        return inv * a % m
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`. It first computes `a % m` and stores the result back into `a`. Then, it calls another function `func_10(b, m)` to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo `m`. If the modular inverse does not exist (i.e., `func_10(b, m)` returns `-1`), the function returns `-999999999`. Otherwise, it returns the product of the modular inverse (`inv`) and the updated `a` (which is `a % m`), all taken modulo `m`.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_6()
    b = func_6()
    l = [0] * n

        if b[i] > 0:
            l[b[i] - 1] += a[i]

            ans += a[l1[i][1]]
        a[l1[i][1]] += l1[i][0]
    func_13(ans)
    func_13(*l2)
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` takes three inputs: `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with values ranging from \(-10^6 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\), and `b` is a list of integers where each element is either a positive integer between 1 and `n` or \(-1\), with the sequence defined by `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, \ldots` always ending with \(-1\).

The function performs the following actions:
1. It initializes a list `l` of length `n` filled with zeros.
2. For each valid index `i` in `b` (i.e., where `b[i] > 0`), it updates `l[b[i] - 1]` by adding the corresponding value from `a`.
3. It then constructs a list `l1` which contains pairs of elements from `l` and their indices.
4. `l1` is sorted based on the first element of each pair.
5. It initializes `ans` to 0 and creates a new list `l2` to store the final indices.
6. For each element in the sorted `l1`, it updates `l2` by adding 1 to the index and adds to `ans` the product of the value from `a` at the current index and the value from `l` at the current index.
7. Finally, it increments the value in `a` at the current index by the value from `l` at the current index.
8. The function calls `func_13` twice: once with `ans` as an argument and once with the elements of `l2`.

After the function concludes, `func_13` is called with two arguments: the sum of certain products involving elements from `a` and `l`, and a list of adjusted indices based on the sorted values of `l` and `b`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))

        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts a variable-length argument list `args` containing integers and a dictionary `kwargs` with optional parameters `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It prints the integers in `args` to the specified output stream (`file`, defaulting to `sys.stdout`) using the specified separator (`sep`, defaulting to a space), ending the output with the specified string (`end`, defaulting to a newline). If `flush` is set to `True`, it forces the output buffer to be flushed. After execution, `file` will contain the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and ended with `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the buffer is flushed. Potential edge cases include empty `args` or `kwargs` dictionaries, and non-integer values in `args`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
