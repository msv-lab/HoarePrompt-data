Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the provided code, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The code calculates the maximum possible value of `ans` by strategically choosing the order of positions to perform the operations on. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes an array `l` to keep track of the additional values added to each index due to the recursive nature of the `b` array.
2. **Processing**: For each position `i`, if `b[i]` is not `-1`, it adds `a[i]` to the corresponding position `b[i] - 1` in the `l` array.
3. **Sorting**: It sorts the indices based on the values in the `l` array.
4. **Final Calculation**: It calculates the final answer and the order of operations by iterating through the sorted indices and applying the operations accordingly.

The code handles the constraints and guarantees mentioned in the problem statement, such as the non-cyclic nature of the `b` array. Since the code follows the logic precisely and no edge cases or inputs are overlooked, it should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem description.
