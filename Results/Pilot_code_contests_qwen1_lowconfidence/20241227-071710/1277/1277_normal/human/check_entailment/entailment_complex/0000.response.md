Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code correctly implements the solution for the problem described. Let's break down the verification process:

1. **Function `func_12`**:
   - The function reads `n`, `a`, and `b` as per the problem description.
   - It processes the arrays `a` and `b` according to the rules described: for each `i` where `b[i] > 0`, it updates the value at index `b[i] - 1` in an auxiliary array `l`.
   - It then sorts the auxiliary array `l1` based on the values added to `l`.
   - It constructs the order of operations to maximize the sum `ans` by iterating over the sorted `l1` and updating `a` and `l` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum `ans` and the order of operations.

2. **Handling of constraints and sequences**:
   - The problem guarantees that the sequence defined by `b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, ...` always ends with `-1`. This is correctly handled in the code through the logic inside the loop where `b[i] > 0`.

3. **Edge cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `b[i] = -1` by not updating `l` for those indices.
   - It correctly accumulates values in `l` based on the sequence defined by `b`.

4. **Output formatting**:
   - The output is formatted as required: the maximum `ans` followed by the order of operations.

5. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations in the code align with the problem description and the implemented logic. They correctly describe the state transitions and the order of operations.

Given the above points, the code follows the problem description for every potential case, and no counterexamples were found where the code fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the code is correct.
