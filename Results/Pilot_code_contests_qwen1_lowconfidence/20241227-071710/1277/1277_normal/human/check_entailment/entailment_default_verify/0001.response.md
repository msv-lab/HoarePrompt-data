Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum possible value of `ans` by strategically choosing the order of positions to perform the operations. The code handles the constraints and guarantees mentioned in the problem statement, such as the non-cyclic nature of the `b` array. Additionally, the `func_13` function, as hinted by the output hints, correctly prints the results to the specified output stream with the appropriate formatting options. There are no indications from the output hints or the code itself that suggest any issues with the program's functionality. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
