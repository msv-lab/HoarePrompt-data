Final: **True**

### Reasoning:
Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value of `ans` by choosing the optimal order of positions `i` to perform the operation. Here are the key points supporting this assessment:

1. **Correct Initialization and Logic**: The program initializes the necessary variables and lists correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement.
2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The program uses an array `l` to store the cumulative sums based on the indices specified in array `b`, ensuring that the additions to `ans` are calculated optimally.
3. **Sorting and Accumulation**: The program sorts the list `l1` to ensure that elements are processed in the order that maximizes the addition of `a[i]` to `ans`.
4. **Result Calculation**: The program calculates `ans` by adding `a[i]` to `ans` if `b[i]` is not `-1`, and updates `a[i]` accordingly.
5. **Output Handling**: The `func_13` function handles the printing of results and order of operations correctly, as indicated by the output hints.

The output hints for `func_13` also confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling various cases such as empty arguments and non-integer values appropriately. Since the program adheres to the problem description and handles all required operations correctly, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
