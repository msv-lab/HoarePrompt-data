You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Captain Fint is involved in another treasure hunt, but have found only one strange problem. The problem may be connected to the treasure's location or may not. That's why captain Flint decided to leave the solving the problem to his crew and offered an absurdly high reward: one day off. The problem itself sounds like this...

There are two arrays a and b of length n. Initially, an ans is equal to 0 and the following operation is defined: 

  1. Choose position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n); 
  2. Add a_i to ans; 
  3. If b_i ≠ -1 then add a_i to a_{b_i}. 



What is the maximum ans you can get by performing the operation on each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) exactly once?

Uncle Bogdan is eager to get the reward, so he is asking your help to find the optimal order of positions to perform the operation on them.

Input

The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of arrays a and b.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (−10^6 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n or b_i = -1).

Additional constraint: it's guaranteed that for any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) the sequence b_i, b_{b_i}, b_{b_{b_i}}, … is not cyclic, in other words it will always end with -1.

Output

In the first line, print the maximum ans you can get.

In the second line, print the order of operations: n different integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n). The p_i is the position which should be chosen at the i-th step. If there are multiple orders, print any of them.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: After reviewing the provided code, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The code calculates the maximum possible value of `ans` by strategically choosing the order of positions to perform the operations on. Here’s a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes an array `l` to keep track of the additional values added to each index due to the recursive nature of the `b` array.
2. **Processing**: For each position `i`, if `b[i]` is not `-1`, it adds `a[i]` to the corresponding position `b[i] - 1` in the `l` array.
3. **Sorting**: It sorts the indices based on the values in the `l` array.
4. **Final Calculation**: It calculates the final answer and the order of operations by iterating through the sorted indices and applying the operations accordingly.

The code handles the constraints and guarantees mentioned in the problem statement, such as the non-cyclic nature of the `b` array. Since the code follows the logic precisely and no edge cases or inputs are overlooked, it should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 13 : The function `func_13` accepts a variable-length argument list `args` containing integers and a dictionary `kwargs` with optional parameters `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. It prints the integers in `args` to the specified output stream (`file`, defaulting to `sys.stdout`) using the specified separator (`sep`, defaulting to a space), ending the output with the specified string (`end`, defaulting to a newline). If `flush` is set to `True`, it forces the output buffer to be flushed. After execution, `file` will contain the concatenated string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` and ended with `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the buffer is flushed. Potential edge cases include empty `args` or `kwargs` dictionaries, and non-integer values in `args`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
