Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of `ans` by strategically choosing the order of positions to perform the operations. The annotated code provides clear steps and states at different parts of the program, confirming that the logic follows the problem constraints and requirements.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_5`, and `func_6` handle the necessary input and initialize the required lists `a` and `b`.
2. **Processing Logic**: The function `func_12` processes the input according to the problem description. It uses the `l` array to accumulate the contributions from the recursive chain of indices in `b`. The sorting and iteration steps ensure that the operations are applied in an optimal order.
3. **Output Generation**: The function `func_13` generates the final output as required, printing both the maximum `ans` and the order of operations.

Given that the annotated code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment, and there are no logical errors or deviations from the problem constraints, the original assessment remains accurate.
