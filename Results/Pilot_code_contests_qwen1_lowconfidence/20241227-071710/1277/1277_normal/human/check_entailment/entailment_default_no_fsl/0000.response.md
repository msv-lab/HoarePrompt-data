Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_12` does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the problem description requires finding the maximum possible value of `ans` by performing the operation on each `i` exactly once, and printing the optimal order of positions to perform the operations.

Here is a case where the code does not work correctly:

Consider the following input:
```
3
1 2 3
2 3 -1
```

According to the problem description, the optimal order of positions to maximize `ans` would be `1 2 3`, resulting in `ans = 10`. However, the code in `func_12` sorts the indices based on the accumulated values in `l` and then constructs the order `l2` based on this sorted list. This approach does not guarantee that the order of operations is optimal for maximizing `ans`.

Let's break down the issue:
1. The code calculates the initial contributions of each element to `l`.
2. It sorts `l` based on these contributions.
3. It then constructs the order `l2` based on the sorted list.

However, sorting based on accumulated values in `l` does not necessarily yield the optimal order. The optimal order should consider both the direct contribution of each element and the indirect contributions through the sequence defined by `b`.

To illustrate, in the given example:
- For `i = 0`, `a[0] = 1` and `b[0] = 2`, so `l[1] += a[0]` making `l[1] = 1`.
- For `i = 1`, `a[1] = 2` and `b[1] = 3`, so `l[2] += a[1]` making `l[2] = 2`.
- For `i = 2`, `a[2] = 3` and `b[2] = -1`, so no changes to `l`.

After sorting, the order `l2` will be `[2, 1, 3]`, and the calculated `ans` will be `10`. However, the optimal order is actually `[1, 2, 3]`, which would result in the same `ans` of `10` but maintains the correct sequence of operations.

Therefore, the code does not always find the optimal order, and hence the correctness is **False**.
