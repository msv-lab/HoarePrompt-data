Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value of `ans` by choosing the optimal order of positions `i` to perform the operation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the necessary variables and lists correctly.
2. **Graph Representation**: It uses an array `l` to store the cumulative sums based on the indices specified in array `b`.
3. **Sorting and Accumulation**: It sorts the list `l1` to ensure that elements are processed in the order that maximizes the addition of `a[i]` to `ans`.
4. **Result Calculation**: The program calculates `ans` by adding `a[i]` to `ans` if `b[i]` is not `-1`, and updates `a[i]` accordingly.
5. **Output**: The program prints the maximum `ans` and the order of operations correctly.

The additional functions (1-13) provided in the code seem to be utility functions or placeholders and do not affect the main logic of the solution. The main function `func_12` handles the core logic correctly based on the problem description.

Since the provided program correctly follows the problem description and handles all given constraints without any issues, the correctness is **True**.
