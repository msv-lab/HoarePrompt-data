The function prompts the user to provide an integer input and returns that integer. There are no preconditions specified for the type of input other than it being an integer. The function does not perform any additional operations or validations on the input. If the user inputs a non-integer value, the program will raise an error since the `input()` function in Python returns a string, which cannot be directly converted to an integer without appropriate handling.
