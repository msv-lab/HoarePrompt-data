#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k < n), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing bidirectional edges between districts). It processes the input to create a tree structure using the provided edges and then modifies this tree based on certain conditions. Specifically, it constructs a storage array to hold temporary values, a lookup array to map district indices to storage indices, and a nodes array to represent the tree structure. After building the initial structure, it traverses the nodes to set certain values in the nodes array according to the rules defined within the loops. Finally, it returns a list of district indices that do not meet a specific condition (where their corresponding node value is not 1) and prints these indices in a space-separated string. The function handles all potential cases where the edges form a valid tree structure, including edge cases where the number of nodes and edges might not strictly adhere to the given constraints. If the edges do not form a valid tree, the function still processes them according to the given logic, ensuring that all possible states of the nodes array are correctly set.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, representing the number of districts and the number of contestants to be removed, respectively. edges is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers a and b representing the districts connected by a path.
def func_2():
    sys.setcheckinterval(2147483647)
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    edges = [map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()) for _ in xrange(n - 1)]
    func_1(n, k, edges)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of districts \( n \), the number of contestants to be removed \( k \), and a list of connections between districts from standard input. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters. After `func_1` completes its execution, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the variable `edges` contains the list of connections between districts, and `n` and `k` hold the values read from the input. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats or values, which would result in undefined behavior as no error handling is explicitly mentioned in the provided code.
