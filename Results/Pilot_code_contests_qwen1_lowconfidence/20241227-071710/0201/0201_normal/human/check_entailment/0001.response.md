Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where multiple components need to be considered after removing `k` contestants. The logic in `func_1` seems to focus on a single component without considering the possibility of multiple connected components in the graph. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
8 4
2 6
2 7
7 8
1 2
3 1
2 4
7 5
```

The expected output is:

```
1 3 4 5
```

However, the provided code might not correctly handle this case because it assumes a single connected component and does not account for the removal of contestants from multiple disconnected subgraphs. This means that the program may fail to correctly identify and remove the necessary contestants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another, while also maximizing the total number of fans.

To verify this, we can manually check the logic with the given example or by providing a more complex test case that includes multiple connected components. Since the provided code does not handle such cases correctly, the correctness of the program is **False**.
