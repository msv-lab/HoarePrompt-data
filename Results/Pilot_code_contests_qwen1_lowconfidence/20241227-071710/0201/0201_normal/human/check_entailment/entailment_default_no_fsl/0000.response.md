Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function appears to be trying to manipulate a tree structure, but it does not seem to properly account for the constraints of the problem. The function seems to be designed to remove certain nodes from the tree to maximize the sum of the remaining nodes' fan counts, but it does not correctly handle the removal of `k` nodes to ensure that the remaining nodes form a connected subgraph.

To illustrate, let's consider the first example given:

**Input:**
```
6 3
2 1
2 6
4 2
5 6
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 3 4
```

However, the provided code does not seem to produce the correct output. The logic in `func_1` involves setting certain values in the `nodes` array, but it does not ensure that the resulting subgraph is connected after removing `k` nodes. Instead, it seems to focus on setting values to -1 or 1, which does not directly translate to removing the correct nodes to form a connected subgraph with the maximum fan count.

Given that the code does not appear to correctly implement the required logic and does not ensure that the remaining nodes form a connected subgraph, the program is not correct for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
