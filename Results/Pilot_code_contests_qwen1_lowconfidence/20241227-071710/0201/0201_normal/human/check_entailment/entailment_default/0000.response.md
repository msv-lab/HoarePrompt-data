Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to remove `k` contestants such that all remaining contestants can still be connected through the districts, and the total number of fans of the remaining contestants is maximized. However, the provided `func_1` does not appear to achieve this.

The function `func_1` constructs a tree structure and then attempts to modify it based on certain conditions. However, the logic inside the function does not clearly demonstrate how it selects the districts to remove in order to maximize the total number of fans. Specifically, the function does not explicitly calculate the total number of fans for the remaining contestants or ensure that all remaining contestants are connected.

Given the problem description and the provided output hints, it seems the function is attempting to manipulate the tree structure in some way, but the logic is not clear or complete. For instance, the function does not appear to consider the fan counts associated with each district or ensure that the remaining contestants form a single connected component.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
6 3
2 1
2 6
4 2
5 6
2 3
```
The expected output is `1 3 4`, but the provided code does not produce this output. The function `func_1` does not clearly implement the logic needed to select the correct districts to remove to meet the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and hence is considered incorrect.
