Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is designed to modify the tree structure based on certain conditions, but it does not ensure that the remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. This is evident in the way the `nodes` array is being manipulated, which does not guarantee the connectivity of the remaining districts.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

Input:
```
6 3
2 1
2 6
4 2
5 6
2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
1 3 4
```

However, the code does not ensure that the remaining contestants form a connected subtree. For instance, after removing contestants from districts 1, 3, and 4, the remaining districts (2, 5, and 6) should still form a connected component. The current implementation does not guarantee this connectivity, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

Therefore, the code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, resulting in an incorrect solution.
