Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to use a data structure to store edges and a traversal algorithm to determine which contestants to remove, but it does not actually implement the logic required to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants. The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify the optimal set of contestants to remove to maximize fan count while ensuring connectivity among the remaining contestants. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for the given problem description.
