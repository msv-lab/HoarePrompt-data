The code snippet appends the value of `p` to the `new_nodes` list. From the initial state, we know that `p` is equal to `(4 * n - 3) * 2`. Therefore, `new_nodes` will have its first element as `p`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0; `i` is `4 * n - 3`; `new_nodes` is a list containing one element `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `abort` is `True` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `abort` remains `False`; `index` is an integer; `c` is an integer; `p` is `(4 * n - 3) * 2`; `flag` is `-1` if `flag` equals `-1`; otherwise, `flag` is `1`.**
