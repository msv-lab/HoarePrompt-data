The code `count = n - k` assigns the value of `n - k` to the variable `count`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `storage[storage_index]` remains `4 * n - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` remains `u`
- `lookup[u]` remains `4 * n - 2`
- `lookup[v]` remains undefined
- `storage_index` remains `8 * n - 4`
- `nodes` remains a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to `n`
- `stack` remains an empty list
- `stack_pop` remains the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` remains the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` remains `0`
- `parent_index` remains `0`
- `v` remains undefined
- `nodes[u * 2]` remains `n`
- `t` remains a negative number
- `count` is now `n - k`

Output State: **`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to `n`, `stack` is an empty list, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `0`, `parent_index` is `0`, `v` is undefined, `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`, `t` is a negative number, `count` is `n - k`**
