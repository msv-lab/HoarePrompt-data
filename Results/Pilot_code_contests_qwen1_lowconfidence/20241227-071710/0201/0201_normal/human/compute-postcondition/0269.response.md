The code assigns `-1` to `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]`. Given that `j` is `-1`, `new_nodes[j]` would be referencing `new_nodes[-1]`, which is undefined in this context since list indices start from 0. However, assuming the intention was to use `new_nodes[0]` (as `j` should refer to an index within the bounds of `new_nodes`), and given that `new_nodes[0] + 1` results in `-1 + 1` which is `0`, the code would assign `-1` to `nodes[0]`.

So, the variable `nodes[0]` changes its value to `-1`. The variable `j` remains `-1` as the assignment to `nodes` does not affect `j`.

Output State: **`nodes[0]` is -1, `j` is -1**
