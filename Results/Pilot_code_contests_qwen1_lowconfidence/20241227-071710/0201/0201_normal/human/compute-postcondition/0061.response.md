To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop step-by-step and build upon the provided intermediate states.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Initial State
- `storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`
- `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `lookup[v]` is `4 * n - 4`
- `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with all elements set to 0
- `stack` is an empty list
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` is `n`
- `parent_index` is `0`
- `t` is `4 * n - 2`
- `v` is undefined

#### Loop Code
```python
while t >= 0:
    v = storage[t + 1]
    t = storage[t]
    if v == parent_index:
        continue
    nodes[v * 2] = index
    stack_append(v)
```

#### First Iteration
- `t` starts as `4 * n - 2`
- `v = storage[t + 1] = storage[4 * n - 1]`
- `t = storage[t] = storage[4 * n - 2]`
- `v` is `u`
- `nodes[u * 2] = index = n`
- `stack` now contains `u`

#### Second Iteration
- `t` is now `storage[4 * n - 2]`
- `v = storage[t + 1] = storage[4 * n - 1]`
- `t = storage[t] = storage[4 * n - 2]`
- `v` is `u`
- `nodes[u * 2]` is already `n` from the previous iteration
- `stack` now contains `[u, u]`

#### Third Iteration
- `t` is now `storage[4 * n - 2]`
- `v = storage[t + 1] = storage[4 * n - 1]`
- `t = storage[t] = storage[4 * n - 2]`
- `v` is `u`
- `nodes[u * 2]` is already `n` from the previous iteration
- `stack` now contains `[u, u, u]`

#### General Pattern
- The loop continues to decrement `t` until `t` becomes negative.
- Each iteration sets `v` to `storage[t + 1]` and then updates `t` to `storage[t]`.
- `v` remains `u` because `storage[4 * n - 1]` is `u`.
- `nodes[u * 2]` is updated to `index` each time `v` is not equal to `parent_index`, but since `v` is always `u`, it only gets updated once.
- `stack` keeps appending `u` until `t` becomes negative.

#### Final State
- When `t` becomes negative, the loop terminates.
- `t` will eventually become negative because `storage[t]` will eventually reference an index outside the valid range of `storage`.
- `stack` will contain multiple occurrences of `u`.

### Final Output State
- `storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`
- `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`
- `lookup[v]` is undefined
- `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0
- `stack` contains multiple occurrences of `u`
- `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`
- `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`
- `index` is `n`
- `parent_index` is `0`
- `t` is a negative number (indicating the loop has terminated)
- `v` is `u`
- `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`

### Output State
**`storage[storage_index]` is `4 * n - 2`, `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `u`, `lookup[u]` is `4 * n - 2`, `lookup[v]` is undefined, `storage_index` is `8 * n - 4`, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[u * 2]` set to `n` and all other elements set to 0, `stack` contains multiple occurrences of `u`, `stack_pop` is the `pop` method of `stack`, `stack_append` is the `append` method of `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is `0`, `t` is a negative number, `v` is `u`, and `nodes[u * 2]` is `n`.**
