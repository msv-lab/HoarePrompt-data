`index` is assigned the value of `nodes[p]`. Given that `p` is calculated as `(4 * n - 2) * 2`, and `nodes` is a list containing `[p]`, the value of `index` will be the element at index `p` in the list `nodes`. Since `nodes` only contains one element `[p]`, the index `p` will always refer to this single element. 

To find the specific value of `index`, we know that `p = (4 * n - 2) * 2`. So, `index` will be `nodes[(4 * n - 2) * 2]`, which is `[p]` itself. Thus, `index` is `[p]`.

The value of `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains `4 * n - 2`, `new_nodes` remains a list containing `[p]`, and `abort` remains `True` if `flag` equals -1, otherwise `False`. If `flag` equals 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, but since no loop or conditional statement is explicitly mentioned in the given code, this remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4 * `n` - 2, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[p]`, `p` is (4 * `n` - 2) * 2, `abort` is True if `flag` equals -1, and `abort` remains False if `flag` does not equal -1 and does not equal (4 * `n` - 2) * 2 + 1, `index` is `[p]`**
