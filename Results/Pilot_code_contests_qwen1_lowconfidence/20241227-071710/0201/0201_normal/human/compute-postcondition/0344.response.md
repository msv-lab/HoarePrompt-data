Given the initial state and the provided code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `new_nodes` is a list of values.
- `p` is the final value.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`.
- `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1`.
- `count` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.
- `c` is less than 0.
- `j` is `-c - 1`.
- `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `new_nodes` is a list of values.
   - `p` is the final value.
   - `abort` is `True`.
   - `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`.
   - `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1`.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.
   - `c` is less than 0.
   - `j` is `-c - 1`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code updates `nodes` by setting `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` to `-1`.

3. **Value Calculation**:
   - `j` is `-c - 1`, and since `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `j` is `len(new_nodes) - 1`.

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` translates to `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1] = -1`.

5. **Updated State**:
   - The value of `nodes` changes such that `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1]` is set to `-1`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `new_nodes` is a list of values.
- `p` is the final value.
- `abort` is `True`.
- `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`.
- `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1` and `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1] = -1`.
- `count` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks.
- `c` is less than 0.
- `j` is `len(new_nodes) - 1`.
- `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`new_nodes` is a list of values, `p` is the final value, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `-len(new_nodes)`, `nodes` is unchanged except `nodes[-1] = -1` and `nodes[new_nodes[len(new_nodes) - 1] + 1] = -1`, `count` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `index` is the value of `nodes[p]` before the loop breaks, `c` is less than 0, `j` is `len(new_nodes) - 1`, `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than 0**
