According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_nodes`. For the loop to execute again, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, `new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `p` is 0, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[1]` is `-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `p` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body increments `p` by 1), so `p` will become 1. The condition for `new_nodes` to allow the loop to continue remains the sameâ€”it must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `new_nodes` must still contain at least one element.
- `p` will be incremented to 1.
- `abort` remains `True`.
- `nodes[1]` remains `-1`.

State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `p` is 1, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[1]` is `-1`**
