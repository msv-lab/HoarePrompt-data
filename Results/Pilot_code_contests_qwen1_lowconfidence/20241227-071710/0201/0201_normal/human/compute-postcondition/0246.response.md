The code `nodes[p + 1] = -1` updates the value of `nodes[p + 1]`. Given that `p` is 2, `p + 1` evaluates to 3. Therefore, `nodes[3]` is assigned the value `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_nodes` must contain at least one element, `p` is 2, `abort` is `True`, and `nodes[1]` is `-1`, `nodes[2]` is `-1`, `nodes[3]` is `-1**
